A car you will enjoy driving in the city • Lower emissions will appeal to environmentally-conscious buyers. And those who aren’t ready for an EV yet • Toyota’s reliability & expertise in hybrid systems is very reassuring • Compliant ride quality coupled with balanced driving dynamics • Well-equipped with features such as driving modes, panoramic sunroof, 360-degree camera, ventilated seats, wireless smartphone charging, connected car features, wireless Android Auto + Apple Carplay and more • Only Crossover in this segment to provide AWD capability • Toyota’s after-sales quality is usually regarded as top-notch by owners • Does most things well, but doesn’t excel in any particular area (other than fuel economy) Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder Cons • Practicality is compromised due to reduced boot space in the full-hybrid variant • Quality of interior plastics feels more “Maruti” than Toyota. Frankly, the S-Cross cabin feels better in quality • Interior is narrow and doesn't feel as roomy as some competitors. Rear seat is best for 2 adults • Missing features such as rain-sensing wipers, premium audio + subwoofer, electric seats, electric parking brake, LED interior lighting, etc. • Lacks the outright performance of the competition. Runs out of steam above 110 kmph • Not as engaging to drive as the German competitors, or the Creta / Seltos turbo-petrols • NVH levels from the drivetrain are surprisingly poor for a hybrid. Sounds from the 3-cylinder engine, electric motor and brake vacuum pump filter into the cabin • AWD available only on the MT (not the AT) and the mild-hybrid (not full-hybrid) • The Honda City’s Hybrid system is smoother, more sophisticated & more refined • Does most things well, but doesn’t excel in any particular area (other than fuel economy) This review has been jointly compiled with Eddy. Thanks to him for the expert observations! Introduction Toyota has been the most successful in selling hybrid cars in India (read Camry). Therefore, it was surprising to see them beaten by Honda in getting Hybrid technology to the mass market. Even though Honda has set the ball rolling with the City e:HEV, it's never too late to respond and Toyota is here with a bang. Toyota's partnership with Maruti Suzuki has so far been limited to badge engineering by Toyota of an existing Maruti product. The Urban Cruiser Hyryder is the first car in whose development, both companies were involved from an early stage. The Urban Cruiser Hyryder is based on Maruti's Global C platform that also underpins the Brezza as well as S-Cross. Toyota will be making the Urban Cruiser Hyryder at its Bidadi plant and supplying it to Maruti, who will sell it as the Grand Vitara. The Hyryder will come with 2 powertrain options - a mild hybrid using Maruti's proven K15C engine and a Toyota strong hybrid system based on the Yaris Hybrid, which is sold in global markets. The mild hybrid version will have 3 drivetrain options including a 5-speed MT with 2WD, 5-speed MT AWD and a 6-speed AT 2WD. Maruti will probably focus on the mild hybrid version as it's their own powertrain and Toyota will push its strong hybrid as the company plans to lead the charge for hybrids with its future products. The Innova is rumored to be the next in line to use a hybrid powertrain. The Urban Cruiser Hyryder is an important product for Toyota as it's the company's only way to get people to adopt hybrids in the mass market. Toyota is far behind in the EV race and has no mass market EV options like the Koreans, the Chinese or even the Europeans to get to India any time soon. Till such a time, it's the hybrids that will buy time for the company. Toyota will launch the powertrain in the mid ""S"", ""G"" and top-end ""V"" variants. Only the base ""E"" variant won't get the strong hybrid option. While both, the mild hybrid and strong hybrid get 1.5-litre petrol engines, they are completely different motors. The Maruti engine is the ubiquitous 4-pot K15C found in other cars such as the XL6, Ertiga and Brezza. The Toyota 1.5-litre engine is a 3-cylinder unit labelled as the M15A Dynamic Force engine under the TNGA platform. Toyota has set up an assembly plant outside Bangalore for this 1.5-litre TNGA motor. Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder Price & Brochure Prices for the different variants of the Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder will be announced in September 2022. You can download the 2022 Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder brochure here: Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder Brochure.pdf Exterior Design & Styling The Hyryder's styling is a bit of a mixed bag. While it has the traditional proportions of an SUV with a squared-off front and rear, the slim lights and narrow body line don't give it the same presence as the Korean twins, especially considering that at 4,365 mm, it is the longest in the segment. Overall, the design is safe and has no shock or wow factor like the Koreans. Some may find it boring, whereas some may appreciate the simple and clean design. Build Quality, Fit & Finish The Urban Cruiser Hyryder is more a Maruti than a Toyota. If you're looking for Toyota-grade build quality and finish, you will be a tad disappointed. It's not as tinny and flimsy as most Marutis. The Hyryder is like the S-Cross - well built but not Euro grade. The doors don't shut with a reassuring thud and the driver's door on our car needed a firm hand to close fully. Panel gaps are tight - typical Japanese precision. Overall, it feels well built, but not overengineered like a proper Toyota. Paint quality, on the other hand, is very good. Wheels & Tyres Toyota has equipped the Urban Cruiser Hyryder with decently sized 17"" wheels. The 215/60 section tyres provide good ride quality (thanks to the tall profile) and very good grip. Ground Clearance Toyota has not revealed the ground clearance of the Urban Cruiser Hyryder. While we did not scrape the underbody anywhere during the test drive, we will leave the final verdict to owners. Standard & Extended Warranty As with all Toyotas, the standard warranty for the Urban Cruiser Hyryder is 3 years or 1 lakh km, which can be extendable up to 5 years or 2.2 lakh km. The warranty for the Hybrid battery is valid for 8 years. We always recommend purchasing the maximum possible extended warranty available for added peace of mind. Safety It's too early to comment on the safety rating of the Urban Cruiser Hyryder as the car has not yet been tested by GNCAP. However, being based on the Global C platform, it will probably not be very poor. The Maruti Brezza, which is built on the same platform, scored a 4-star rating. To top it off, Toyota has equipped the Hyryder with safety features such as 6 airbags, VSC, ISOFIX child seat mounts, 3-point seatbelts for all 5 occupants, TPMS and 360-degree camera system.", 28th August 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,"17,716","43,228"
1, Vid6639 , 12:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Interior Cabin Design & Quality Step inside the Urban Cruiser Hyryder and you are greeted by a cabin that will feel more familiar if you are coming from a Maruti than a Toyota. There are a lot of parts shared with Maruti cars, especially the new Brezza. The steering wheel and switchgear are identical to the Maruti and so is the infotainment head-unit on top of the dash. The interior is all hard plastics, but there is some soft-touch faux leather used on the dash as well as door pads, which don't make it feel as cheap. What works is the colour palette of black with brown inserts. The chocolate brown inserts on the seats, doors and dashboard make it feel less budget grade and give it a premium look. This colour combo is available only on the strong hybrid. The mild hybrid gets an all-black cabin, which we feel will not be as premium-looking. The A/C controls are identical to the new Brezza's and feel durable. However, there are a lot of places that feel cheap and bring down the overall feel unbefitting a Toyota. While the side A/C vents feel good to use, the centre A/C vents feel extremely cheap. There is no chrome but cheap silver paint on the A/C slider. The action feels rubbery and the plastic moulding has rough edges around it. Around the knee area there is a piece of brown plastic on the centre console. This should have been padded vs cheap hard plastic. None of the window controls is illuminated except for the driver window switch. All cabin lamps are old school halogen units and not LEDs, which is the norm in this segment. The front seatbase does not get any plastic surround and is instead just covered in carpeting material. We just wish that the cabin holds up over time and is not like existing Maruti vehicles with rattles surfacing in a few months of ownership. Space & Comfort There is a good amount of space at the front with the seats having a pretty decent travel range. Being a typical crossover design, ingress & egress is super easy and you simply walk in and out of the Hyryder. The front seats are comfortable, but not perfect. They are of medium width and larger users will find them a tad narrow. Driving Position & Ergonomics The driver seat gets height adjustment and has a good travel range too. What's good is the steering has tilt and telescopic adjustment. This means finding a comfortable driving position is easier. However, I do wish the the telescopic adjustment had a longer range as I have a laid back driving position and prefer the steering to be nearer. My old Ecosport and Corolla have a much longer adjustment range for the steering. While I was fairly comfortable in my driving position, Eddy wasn't able to find a very comfortable position easily. He found the upper back support to be more intrusive and had to adjust the seat a few times to get comfortable. Visibility out front is very good. You can see the bonnet when driving and the window line is also not high. The A-pillars are not thick, which means there's no blind spot like in some crossovers. Cabin Storage The Hyryder gets multiple storage spaces and buyers won't have much to complain about. The glovebox is of medium size, but it doesn't get a cooling vent. The centre console has a wireless charging pad ahead of the gear lever. Behind the gear lever there are 2 fairly large cupholders and a sliding centre armrest with a small storage box below. All 4 doors can hold a 1 litre bottle, with space left over for knick-knacks. Air-Conditioning The Hyryder's automatic climate control system worked well in Bangalore. While the weather was pleasant with no scorching heat, we had parked the car under the sun and the cabin cooled down within a few minutes of us getting back inside. The strong hybrid gets a different A/C compressor than the mild hybrid, since it's not belt driven and is an electrically operated compressor like the inverter A/C at home. Features Unique & Noteworthy Features Toyota and Maruti were never known to load their cars with crazy features. However, the onslaught from the Koreans has resulted in the duo updating their new models with a host of features. The Hyryder, as a result, is pretty well-loaded when it comes to features. For a starter, the Hyryder is the only Toyota after the 50 lakh Camry to get a sunroof. Not just a normal sunroof, but a proper panoramic sunroof. Remember the Brezza that was launched recently, was the first Maruti car with a sunroof. So, this is a big deal for both Toyota and Maruti. The Hyryder also gets a 360-degree camera, which is the same as the Baleno and Brezza and it is a serious disappointment. The resolution will make the VGA cameras of early 2000s look like HD units. You cannot imagine this kind of low resolution from a car in 2022 let alone 5 years back. You get a head-up display, which shows good detailed information and what's cool is that in the strong hybrid, it shows the energy flow in the head-up screen allowing you to drive efficiently. The front seats are ventilated, which was a boon in the afternoon. The strong hybrid gets a virtual display vs the analog dials in the mild hybrid. There is ambient lighting, but only in one colour - white. The lights are very discreet with a small strip on the dash and in the door handle cavity. There's wireless charging for your phone coupled with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Connectivity features with remote operation from the Toyota app have been provided too. These are a norm in today's age. You also get auto LED headlamps and an auto-dimming IRVM. Strangely there are no fog lamps at all since the headlights are lower down in the bumper. There's a tyre pressure monitoring system provided as well. Among the omissions are electric seats, which the Korean twins get, rain-sensing wipers, electric parking brake with auto hold (City Hybrid and Creta have this) and rear sunblinds. Audio System & Sound Quality The audio system is again typical Maruti grade. The 9"" touch screen infotainment system is basically the Maruti SmartPlay Pro+ system rebadged as Smartplay Cast. Lower variants get a 7"" unit. The new 9"" system is a huge step up from the older Smartplay system. Touch response is far better and the UI is more intuitive as well, resulting in a seamless operation. The system is tuned by Arkamys and plays music through 4 speakers and 2 tweeters. Audio quality is decent but nowhere close to the likes of the JBL and Sony systems in competitor SUVs. While the bass is good, the system lacks clarity and the vocals, especially, are muffled. It gets loud with minimal distortion, but doesn't have a deep thump or clarity. This system gets a 6/10 and with no subwoofer, falls behind the competition. Rear Passengers Rear Seat Comfort & Space Getting in and out of the rear seat of the Hyryder is easy. However, the space between the B-pillar and rear seat isn't very big, which means you don't just walk in and out very easily. Once you are seated at the back it's fairly comfortable with supportive seats. The rear seats, however, aren't what you would call spacious. The width of the rear bench makes the Hyryder comfortable for 2 people. The 3rd passenger will find it a squeeze. The rear backrest does recline by a single notch, but even in the reclined position, it's not a very relaxed position. In terms of legroom, a 6-footer like me can sit behind myself, but just about. Usually, SUVs are very good when it comes to headroom, but here too, the rear headroom is just acceptable. For a 6-footer it's just about enough of it with ~2 inches to spare if you don't sit upright. If you sit upright, then it's tight. Boot Space Boot space is where hybrid cars see the biggest compromise. We saw the Honda City lose 200 litres of boot space in the hybrid version vs the petrol. Similarly, the battery pack in the boot of the Hyryder eats into the space and significantly reduces the available height. You cannot stack suitcases on top of each other as a result. The mild hybrid version does not have this issue and gets a much larger boot. Also, with the strong hybrid, the spare tyre sits below the car and not inside the boot.", 28th August 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,"17,716","43,228"
2, Vid6639 , 12:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Driving the Urban Cruiser Hyryder 1.5L Hybrid Toyota's focus was on the hybrid. Hence, it had only that engine option for us to drive. The hybrid powertrain consists of a 3-cylinder 1.5-litre petrol engine with an output of 91 BHP @ 5,500 rpm and 122 Nm @ 4,400 rpm. This petrol engine is coupled with an electric motor that puts out 79 BHP and 141 Nm. The combined power output available at the wheels is 114 BHP. The figures aren't impressive when compared to the turbo petrol engines used by the Koreans and Europeans and that is reflected out on the road as well. The USP of the hybrid is fuel efficiency and not performance. There is a 0.76 kWh battery in the boot that powers the electric motors and is responsible for the drive to the wheels in hybrid mode. The battery specifications are very similar to the Honda City Hybrid, which means you can't really use the Hyryder in EV mode for more than a couple of minutes before the internal combustion engine kicks in to assist. Surprisingly, the Hyryder uses a Li-ion battery vs the Camry which gets a Ni-Mh unit. Li-ion batteries are superior and have a longer life than Ni-Mh batteries. The Hyryder, unlike the City Hybrid, uses a more conventional hybrid system using a power split device as well as an e-CVT transmission that combines the power from the petrol and electric motors. There is no clever drive lock system like in the City here. As a result, the Hyryder feels like a regular CVT to drive with some correlation between speed and engine rpm. Keep your foot on the brake and press the blue power button and all you get is a ready symbol on the dash telling you the car is ""on"". Since it usually starts in EV mode, the internal combustion engine never comes on at idle. You can start off in EV mode in your driveway. It's only when the battery state of charge goes below the threshold that the internal combustion engine comes on to charge the battery. Drive with a light foot and you will hear the petrol engine coming on just to charge the battery and switch off once the battery is charged. At low speeds, inside the city, the Hyryder is quite peppy to drive. The electric torque really helps in closing gaps to the cars in front and makes the Hyryder an absolute breeze to drive in traffic. The petrol engine keeps coming on and off discretely and seamlessly. The only time you will hear the petrol engine rev up is if you drive aggressively. Drive with a heavy foot and you will hear more of the petrol engine as it is used not just to charge the battery, but to also send combined power to the wheels. Within the city, the combination of electric motor and e-CVT results in one of the smoothest drive experiences you can imagine. It feels at home pottering around town and you never get tired even when stuck in traffic. Out on the highway, things are a little different. You cannot just mash the throttle expecting instant response. Overtaking needs planning and momentum is the name of the game. Progress up to 100-110 km/h is brisk and you will find the Hyryder is able to cruise at triple-digit speeds fairly comfortably. After crossing 110 km/h though, the Hyryder begins to run out of steam. The petrol engine gets more vocal and stays on to provide the power needed. This impacts fuel efficiency. The Hyryder can cruise comfortably once at speed but doesn't like bursts of acceleration for quick overtakes. This car is not for enthusiastic drivers. It's for sedate drivers who love to cruise at 90-100 km/h. Drive sedately and you will be rewarded with a smooth drive experience coupled with excellent efficiency. The Hyryder gets drive modes that basically alter the throttle response as well as the behaviour of the internal combustion engine. There is a dedicated EV mode button that will let you drive the Hyryder as an EV for the max distance possible. However, if you are heavy on the throttle or the car crosses ~40 km/h or the battery's state of charge is too low, the system will go back from EV mode to hybrid mode. It's basically useful if you want to take the car to drop the kids off at their school bus pick-up point near your house. Apart from the EV mode, there are 3 drive modes, Normal, Eco and Power. These 3 modes alter the throttle response. The normal mode is the default mode which is right in the middle of Eco and Power modes. It works best in town and offers the ideal compromise between efficiency and performance. In fact, you really don't need to change it unless you're driving uphill or on undivided highways. In Eco mode, the internal combustion engine doesn't come on as easily unless you press the throttle a lot more. The response is lazier and it tries to keep it in hybrid mode with the internal combustion engine only charging the battery and not sending power to the wheels unless the accelerator is pressed very firmly. In Power mode, it's the opposite. Even with a light dab of the throttle, the internal combustion motor comes alive and assists the power delivery. On undivided highways, this is the mode to use to pull off safe overtakes. Throttle response is much sharper and you rarely see the internal combustion engine turning off. Of course, this mode impacts fuel efficiency the most. We used this mode to climb up Nandi hills as the car really struggled to climb up in the other modes. You also get a ""B"" mode which is engaged via the gear shifter. This mode provides maximum regen braking. It is very useful when going downhill as it charges up the battery within a few minutes and you can also use this when slowing down while approaching a red light. You can drive in ""B"" mode to get maximum engine braking. Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH) The Hyryder's NVH levels were a bit of a surprise. While the Hyryder did a good job of isolating road noise and outside traffic noise, the powertrain is not like the quiet and serene hybrids we have seen in the Camry or even the City. The 1.5L engine is a 3-cylinder motor and whenever it is turned on, you can feel it in the cabin. When you press the throttle, the 3-cylinder thrum is always audible in the cabin. It's not a refined sporty growl like a 4-pot motor. If the car is idling for long and the battery level drops too low, the petrol motor comes on and the whole cabin initially vibrates like an Alto! This was very apparent and Toyota really needs to improve the NVH levels of this powertrain. We didn't get to drive the mild hybrid, but I strongly believe that it will have better NVH levels than this strong hybrid. Other than that, you also get different whines inside the cabin from the electric components. When accelerating, there is a high-pitched whine from the electric motor, which is faintly audible. When you apply the brakes, you can hear the regen whine which is common in hybrids. However, one very irritating sound was a 3-second whine, which would keep coming on and off. This was heard when the traffic around was lesser. The sound was traced down to the electric vacuum pump for the mechanical brakes. Since this is a hybrid powertrain, the petrol engine keeps turning on and off. The vacuum system for the brakes is electric vs hydraulic in other cars. This vacuum pump makes a loud whine when it comes on. What's good, is that road noise and suspension noise are well contained and overall NVH levels aren't too bad, especially for the rear passengers. It's only the front passenger and driver who will notice these whines from the powertrain. Mileage & Fuel economy The highlight and the biggest USP of the Hyryder hybrid have to be its fuel efficiency. Inside the city, with a normal driving style that isn't too aggressive, you will comfortably see close to 20 km/l and maybe even more. We drove through some small towns and were able to extract 22 km/l from the Hyryder without trying too hard. The more you use the car in slow moving traffic the better FE you get. The highway is where the FE drops below 20 km/l and when driving uphill, you can see as low as 12 km/l. For urban commutes, you can easily get a range of 800 km+ range on a full tank. In fact, we drove the Hyryder for close to 2 hours with a lot of idling and a lot of unwanted acceleration, but the fuel gauge never went down and remained at the full level for more than 120 km of driving within town. The hybrid competes with diesel on running costs and beats it in town. If you drive with the energy flow diagram displayed on the screen, you can actually adapt to driving a hybrid and extract even more FE from it. The trick is to keep the orange IC engine from coming on as much as possible. Throttle input needs to be measured and you will easily see 24-25 km/l on the MID. Enough space in the engine bay to access everything. Also, the paint quality inside is as good as the outside. Hidden areas in other cars, especially Marutis, aren't as well done usually: No engine cover to hide all the cables and pipes. Gives the engine bay quite an ungainly appearance when you open the bonnet: Thick insulation is provided to improve NVH: This metal cylinder is the electric vacuum pump for the braking system. You can constantly hear a 3-second whine inside the cabin whenever it turns on: There are 2 separate coolant circuits. The one with the green cap is the coolant circuit for the power control unit which manages the Hybrid powertrain: The other coolant circuit is for the petrol engine: Notice the A/C compressor with the high voltage symbol. Being a hybrid, the A/C compressor is an electric unit and not operated by the engine belt conventionally: Standard 12V battery is for the accessories. In the Camry, this battery is placed in the boot. But with the smaller 3-cylinder engine, Toyota has been able to pack it in the engine bay itself: Toyota clearly mentions the position of the batteries. It also claims that the A/C oil (ND-Oil 11) is a superior grade oil to the more commonly used grade Oil 8: Hybrid battery is rated at 0.76 kWh - almost the same as that on the Honda City Hybrid: Hybrid battery is a Li-Ion unit, unlike the Camry that runs on a nickel-metal hydride battery: Suspension Ride Comfort The Hyryder gets a fairly simple suspension setup with MacPherson struts at the front and a torsion beam at the rear. The suspension is well-tuned. At slow speeds, there is a hint of underlying firmness. This is probably more to do with the 17"" rims than the suspension tuning. At medium speeds, the Hyryder irons out all imperfections and even if you miss spotting a pothole doesn't result in the shock getting transmitted into the cabin. Overall ride comfort at slow speeds is pliant, but not plush. The firmer setup works well out on the highway. The Hyryder doesn't have vertical movement and handles bad sections of road thrown at it with aplomb. The firmness at slow speeds translates to a stable ride at higher speeds. Handling & Dynamics The surprise of the package was the driving dynamics of the Hyryder. High speed stability is very good. To test the handling, we took it up Nandi hills and were pleasantly surprised. I was amazed how easy it was to maintain the line through fast sweeping turns up Nandi hills. It was easy to throw the car into hairpin bends and exit them without running wide. The Hyryder's handling was a surprising revelation. The sad thing was that while climbing uphill, the engine was the limiting factor as it was unable to keep up with the chassis. With the performance on tap, you won't really reach anywhere close to the handling limits of the Hyryder. Steering The steering of the Hyryder is also well calibrated. It isn't super light like Maruti cars. There is some amount of weight to it even though it is devoid of feedback. It also self-centers. The steering is well-tuned at slow speeds with some weight and gets heavier as the speed goes up. When pushing it through a series of turns, it has a sharp turn in. It's not vague and doesn't require mid corner corrections to maintain a line. Braking Being a hybrid, braking is different compared to conventional cars. Firstly, the Hyryder uses regen braking to recover energy to charge the battery. Secondly, the vacuum booster is electric and doesn't use the pedal and engine like normal braking systems. With disc brakes all-round, braking is good, but needs time to get used to. It's difficult to get a linear braking response. Sometimes you hit a speed breaker a tad faster than you intended to since the braking isn't linear. This needs getting used to. It will catch you off guard initially, but after a while, you get accustomed to it and change your braking style accordingly.", 28th August 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,"17,716","43,228"
3, Vid6639 , 12:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder Exterior Images Front fascia looks clean and butch thanks to the massive grill. While the car has road presence, it's definitely not as much as the Creta or Seltos: Rear end looks are acceptable to most. Silver skid plates add to the SUV look. This car is a prime candidate for some debadging: It's easy to see that the Hyryder is one of the longer cars in the segment at 4365mm. It's 50mm longer than the Seltos and 65mm more than the Creta. The cladding runs all around the car and definitely enhances its looks. However, the wheel wells appear a little too large: The overall design is simple and not overdone and hence, quite elegant: At first glance, the Hyryder resembles the Brezza from this angle: DRLs are reasonably bright and double up as turn-indicators: Front end has just the right amount of chrome in the form of a strip merging with the two headlamps and the Toyota logo in the centre. Bumper sports a huge air dam with a honeycomb mesh grille. Silver skid plate is of good quality and should hide scratches well: A closer look at the detailing on the radiator grille. The cool weavy pattern is known as herringbone, quite popular in Japan: LED projector headlights sport a chrome border. We could not check their effectiveness as it was a day drive: Front camera sits right on top of the number plate: Very good ground clearance which will be a boon on Indian roads. The underbody is well protected too: Wipers are the regular Maruti ones - nothing to write home about: Front passenger door sports a ""Hybrid"" logo. Piano black ORVMs with integrated turn-indicators house the side view cameras: Both front door handles have request sensors: The rear quarter panel glass is quite big and helps make the cabin feel roomier: 17"" diamond cut alloys are a welcome sight. 215/60 section Apollo Apterra tyres provide good grip: Disc brakes have been provided at the rear as well: Both front and rear wheel wells get full cladding, which helps in reducing NVH levels: No stickers anywhere mentioning the fuel type on the fuel lid. Be sure to inform the attendant at the fuel station about the Hyryder's diet: Roof sports silver roof-rails, shark fin antenna and the panoramic sunroof. You get dual tone (black roof) as an option with the blue, white, red and silver colours: C-shaped split LED tail-lamps look handsome: Badge with the full brand name on the left. The reverse and indicator lights are housed in a separate cluster below the tail lamps: Variant badge is pasted on the right, along with (yet another!) Hybrid badge: Neatly integrated rear camera is placed next to the electromagnetic boot release: Unlike the cost-cutting we have recently seen in some cars (read VW), the Hyryder gets four parking sensors at the rear.

4, Vid6639 , 12:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder Interior Images Black + chocolate brown dual-tone interiors. I personally prefer these dark interiors as they are easier to maintain, and hence, look better than lighter shades: Steering wheel gets tilt + telescopic adjustment. It also feels good to hold with all buttons being easily accessible and intuitive to use: The head-up display (HUD) pops up as soon as you start the car, and its position is adjustable: As expected, the wiper and headlight control stalks are from Maruti: Engine start-stop button is blue in colour indicating it's a hybrid and is labelled ""Power"". Controls for the HUD adjustment are also seen here: The MID menu. The display is sharp. You can choose how the speedometer looks - analogue (in the pic above) or digital (in the pic below). Pretty cool: Digital speedometer and no tachometer. Being a hybrid, all you see is Charge/Eco and Power indicating your driving style: All windows come with a heavy green tint. This will be very useful in a hot country where sunfilms are banned. No sunshades provided: Doorpads look good, and have good quality faux leather. The doors shut with a sound comparable to the Maruti S-Cross: Door handles and all the control switches are from Maruti. Good for cost-cutting, bad for those who are seeking some exclusivity or change. Only driver side power window gets one-touch up / down feature: All doors can hold a 1 litre bottle and other knick knacks: Front seats are well contoured with good bolstering. All controls are manual and there is no plastic surround around the seat base which takes away any premium feel: Centre armrest is very comfortable for both the driver and the passenger. The sliding range is really helpful, even for the shorter drivers: Seat belts are adjustable for height: Pedals are well spaced and the dead pedal is quite comfortable. Floor mats, however, could have been of better quality: Auto-dimming IRVM is par for the segment: Wireless Android Auto connects seamlessly. Screen resolution is par for the segment. No complaints here: Energy flow meter shows what's happening with the drivetrain. It is interesting to see whether the petrol engine is being used to charge the battery, provide power or whether it is simply off. You can customize your driving style to extract the maximum fuel efficiency by reducing usage of the petrol motor to the minimum: Quality of the rear camera is pathetic, to say the least. It feels like the VGA cameras of yore. This is one of our big complaints with the car. The 360 degree camera shows a white car, inspite of the actual car being blue: Temperature and the air flow control switches are of good quality and feel nice to use. Notice that the controls are identical to the ones in the Brezza. The tiny horizontal buttons right below feel plasticky and of poor quality: Centre console gets a wireless charging pad, a 12V power outlet and a USB port: Gear shifter is typical Maruti except for the ""B"" mode, which is exclusive to the hybrid for the regen mode: The car has three drive modes - Eco, Normal and Sport, which you can engage via the switch next to the handbrake. There is also an EV mode button, which will try to keep the car in EV mode provided conditions are met such as accelerator input and the battery's state of charge. The front seats are cooled at three levels: Underneath the armrest is a deep storage bin. Also notice the two cupholders next to the parking brake: The regular glove compartment is deep, but not very wide. Strangely, it doesn't get a cooling vent - something the cheaper Brezza gets: Both sunvisors get vanity mirrors with illumination: Sunroof controls are easily accessible. Interior lights are all regular bulbs, not LEDs. Bluetooth mic is housed in the same assembly, along with a flimsy sunglass holder: This is how the open sunroof looks from the outside... ...and from inside. While the sunroof is panoramic, it's not the largest one around. However, it opens up a lot more. You can see even the rear glass panel slides inside almost fully. However, the sliding cover is like a very thin cloth and doesn't do much to block out the sun: The keyfob is quite plain Jane, but it is compact - comfortable to keep in the pocket: Rear doorpads, like the front ones, have a good amount of faux leather padding and that too not just where you rest your elbows: Though the doors do not open at 90 degrees, ingress & egress is quite easy: Ample leg room at the rear. However, the interior width is not enough and that will be a deal breaker for those who want to seat three passengers in the rear: Even for a 6-footer like me, legroom is more than sufficient even when the front seat is pushed all the way back. No complaints here. Headroom is sufficient but not excessive. If you recline the backrests, you are good. Else it's a close shave with the head liner: Decent under-thigh support with good legroom means that the chauffeur driven won't have much to complain: All rear seats get headrests and more importantly, three-point seatbelts. Huge thumbs up for Toyota for not skimping on the 3rd passenger's safety: The middle seatbelt mechanism: Centre armrest is wide, comfortable and houses two cupholders: We could not figure out the utility of this hook. Is it there to hold up the armrest? If yes, what is the need? ISOFIX child seat mounts on both sides: The vent next to the rear seat is to cool the hybrid battery pack by taking in the cold air from the cabin and blowing it around the battery enclosure: Front seatbacks have wide pockets. Notice that the floor is not flat. In fact, the floor hump is quite noticeable - probably due to the fact that there is an AWD variant with the drive shaft running through: Eddy says the rear A/C vents solve a big problem that his S-Cross has: Two charging ports provided - one each of USB-A and C-Type, along with a small cubby hole for storage: The biggest deal breaker in this car - the hybrid battery eats up a lot of space behind the rear seat making it insufficient for a full family's weekend luggage: The amount of space that you get with the parcel tray in place is even lesser as you cant stack bags. This is a cabin luggage-size bag. Parcel tray has a prominent border to prevent small objects from sliding off. Good touch: You get marginally more space by removing the tray on the floor of the boot, but it results in a step. For max carrying capacity, you will have to leave the floor tray as well as parcel tray at home: Top-tether for ISOFIX mounts: Small hook to hold shopping bags on one side: Small, incandescent boot light (not LED) and a 12V power outlet in the boot: Remove the floor tray and lift the flap up to access the tool kit, which is well packed neatly in a Styrofoam casing: Storage areas with a cover on both sides of the boot. Useful for storing things like a tyre inflator and a bottle of coolant: You can remove the 6 circular clips by hand to access the hybrid battery pack: Safety socket that should be opened only by professionals after taking care of grounding using a specific tool: Rear seatbacks are split in a 60:40 ratio: Folding the rear seatbacks gives you a lot more cargo space. Seatback do not fold completely flat though: ", 28th August 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,"17,716","43,228"

Do most things right by mass market standards, without excelling in any particular area, and back it up with ""cant-go-wrong"" brands, reliability & after-sales service. Question is = will these cars be a runaway success like the Brezza? After all, competition is very fierce here & customer expectations are higher. A lot depends on the pricing too. Adding the hybrid system was a smart move = that is a key differentiator over other crossovers in an FE-obsessed country. But the quality, refinement etc reinstate my belief that Maruti simply cannot build truly premium cars yet. They are stuck in the ""mainstream"" quality mentality.

8, Durango Dude , 12:54 ,Senior - BHPian,"Maruti and Toyota will have a lot of ""convincing"" to do to buyers in order to sell these twins, if priced right people may take the bite, but the top end will retail at close to Rs24L OTR is my guess and at that price there many choices at that price point and below it that are more ""convincing"" to the buyers to plonk their money on. With just Urban Fuel Efficiency alone you can't convince buyers and charge a huge premium. From the videos one can see that NVH levels are not up to expected standards on hard driving. Plus at that top end asking price there more substantial 7 seater options that are loaded to the gills with features and equipment to entice buyers such as Alcazar and Carens. Toyota and Maruti have their work cut out regards: getting a five seater with compromised boot capacity at the price of a seven seater based on fuel efficiency alone. Even the lower variants: mild hybrids will fall short due to the tall gearing of the 1.5 which is already underwhelming in performance in smaller Brezza will be barely adequate in the Vitara/Hyryder since the USP of these twins would be fuel efficiency. So one can't have a Full Hybrid with 20 kmpl Fuel Efficiency and a mild Hybrid automatic with 10kmpl fuel efficiency. Both the mild and full hybrids have to be evenly matched.

The hybrid, with its combined petrol + electric power, still has specs comparable to only the base variant engine from rivals (Toyota 1.5 Hybrid combined - 115ps, 141Nm, Creta/Seltos 1.5 MPi - 115ps, 144Nm, Taigun/Kushaq 1.0 TSi - 115ps, 178Nm).

No diesel option, but that was already obvious. What wasn't though - is that this hybrid doesn't compensate for the lack of a diesel option because of weak highway performance.

Props to both Toyota and MSIL for starting a new trend in an otherwise generic segment where most of the car manufacturers follow the same basic recipe. I am very interested to see how the pricing of the car plays out since I am looking to add another car in the garage which will be used for city runs but should be an all-rounder. Currently I have my eyes set on the City Hybrid but wouldn't mind picking up a Hyryder if the price is in a similar ballpark. The Hyryder would have been my immediate choice if it weren't for the Marutiness in the vehicle (not necessarily a bad thing in the long run)., 28th August 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Mumbai,471,"1,077"

20, CEF_Beasts , 13:56 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"For me the takeaway from the review of the Urban Cruiser Hyryder is; 1.) It’s a good 2nd car at best, can’t be part of a only one car garage. 2.) The Creta is loved for it’s ease of driving in the city, this hybrid motor of the Hyryder can make it even more effortless and efficient for city-usage. 3.) Handling is sure-footed, so no boat-like feel at 80-100 kmph. 4.) Variants and feature distribution is very very awkward! Eg: AWD MT doesn’t get ventilated seats, and 6spd AT Neo-drive mild Hybrid V variant doesn’t get many features present in the eCVT Strong Hybrid V variant! 5.) Sometimes I don’t understand how can people compare a Hybrid with turbo-petrols. Yes, pricing maybe similar but use case will be completely different. Otherwise, why would people be buying the more expensive Camry Hybrid over the equally good if not better Škoda Superb? Both Superb and Camry have their own strong points which make them sell, same will the case with the Hyryder vs turbo-petrol competitors. 6.)

Why I say almost is the lack of AWD and the compromised bootspace(can live with this though). Am surprised to see AWD is available only in MT version. Hope in future facelifts they go the whole hog and provide Strong Hybrid + AT + AWD. The key factor would be pricing as its competitors(Creta/Seltos) are very well established. But since Toyota and Maruti have a very strong fan following & trust factor in our market I feel they won’t have too much of a problem selling this. And being a strong hybrid I don’t think they will or need to undercut competition. Being based on Brezza’s platform & having decent amount of safety features I hope it scores a 5* or at least a 4* with stable bodyshell.

I feel the performance may be better than the turbo petrol till one stays with in sane speeds. I'm not sure about that, but I think I get what you're saying so let me add my 2 cents: 1) Your statement ""most of the hybrid's torque is available at 0 RPM"" holds true for EVs, but hybrids don't usually work like that. The motor may be capable of 79BHP and a reasonable 144nm of torque, but the rest of the powertrain may not be able to/may choose not to deploy the power to get that 144nm down as an instant response. This would drain the battery in no time at all, wreak havoc on it's longevity, and even with all this, the electric motor just isn't that powerful to begin with! (half as powerful as a Nexon EV's, and the underpowered NA won't be of much help off the line.) What they will do is complement each other really well, and these hybrid systems will provide a brisk (but not superlative like an EV) driving experience at city speeds. 2) I've seen it repeated on the forum that turbo-petrols only provide power at very high RPMs. I'm not sure if I've misunderstood this, but here's my take : Turbo-petrols such as the GDi and the TSi produce peak torque at 1500RPM and peak power around 5000RPM, whereas a high-revving NA, say VTEC, engine produces peak torque at 4600RPM and peak power at 6600RPM. Turbo lag (technically, boost threshold) is a different concern, and yes, large NA engines have better instantaneous throttle response (coupled with slightly smaller gearing because they can rev higher), but I don't think the idea that NA engines have more torque available at lower RPMs is true. In fact, I see this mentioned as a negative for turbo-petrols, when it's the exact opposite - NA engines need to be revved high to get the most out of them, but they are much more rev-happier than their turbo-petrol equivalents, and it's likely they have better instantaneous throttle response (which is nullified in the case of an automatic because these are usually combined with CVTs, which are notorious for their instant response or lack thereof) All in all this is likely a brisk city car, but it's no EV, and I don't think it's going to hold a candle to a 1.4TGDi/1.5TSi mated with a DCT at any speed despite likely being priced the same/slightly more than the 1.4/1.5 turbo-petrols. Compared to the 1.0TSi combined with a torque converter? Can't say. What I will say is this: this car doesn't need a win in the performance scorecard to do well in a prospective customer's eyes - it just needs to be smooth and peppy in the city, which it seems to be.", 28th August 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Sydney,128,520

Sure not a car for enthusiast. Neither it is as spacious as a Creta/Seltos. This may be good choice for anyone with ONLY car garage requirement. But it has all the bells and whistles, that a typical Indian buyer wants plus the BRAND VALUE. If this was a car from any other brand, then I will go all-in to place against its success.

42, BoneCollector , 20:37 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Great review, as always. Quote: Out on the highway, things are a little different. You cannot just mash the throttle expecting instant response. Overtaking needs planning and momentum is the name of the game. Progress up to 100-110 km/h is brisk and you will find the Hyryder is able to cruise at triple-digit speeds fairly comfortably. After crossing 110 km/h though, the Hyryder begins to run out of steam. The petrol engine gets more vocal and stays on to provide the power needed. This impacts fuel efficiency. The Hyryder can cruise comfortably once at speed but doesn't like bursts of acceleration for quick overtakes. This car is not for enthusiastic drivers. It's for sedate drivers who love to cruise at 90-100 km/h. Drive sedately and you will be rewarded with a smooth drive experience coupled with excellent efficiency. I was wondering how many people would find this as a negative point and how many as a positive one. There are people who do not drive pedal to metal and don't like to do crazy overtaking. So I think this car will do good. As far as the boot space is concerned, I've first hand experience of the small boot of Brezza and if I've to carry more luggage, all I do is remove the parcel tray. So I can't say it's a deal breaker. A couple of points that I would have loved if it was done- 1. A photograph of a person sitting in the middle seat with the 3 point seatbelt on. That would give a good perspective to someone who has never seen it being used. 2. I understand that it was a day drive. It would have been nice if night time drive was also done. We could have got the real world light performance.

But for this case EV's are more efficient and offer better power. If the long drive FE is around any other petrol engine then I'd prefer a turbo petrol for their performance. Again, the hybrids in more matured market are being offered with turbo engines. I feel really sad when we get to pick one of the things about cars and pay lots of money for the same. My question is, how much this would have changed if they've added a bigger battery and made this into a plug-in?

Absolutely agree with your views here. the abundance of shared parts from lower segment offerings like the Baleno and the Brezza that have been included in the Hyryder/Grand Vitara take away the premiumness of the car. It is not unlike the Koreans' strategy, where they released the Creta/Seltos with premium cabins and the same tricked down to the Venue/Sonet, the same would not have worked the other way around. Moreover the Maruti's interior fit and finish and quality of materials are still not up to the standards set by the Korean duo.

Internationally, none of the Toyotas sacrifice as much boot space in hybrids. Even the Prius which had this problem earlier has sorted it in the latest version by pushing the battery pack under the rear seats. Boot space apart, the overall Maruti like interior feel including the below par panoramic sunroof, the 3 cylinder engine and its performance at top speeds are all disappointing. The only thing good about the car is 20+KMPL FE which is on par with the ranges of cars which Toyota sells internationally. When I first heard about this rebadging business between Maruti and Toyota along with joint development, I thought this will help Maruti elevate itself to produce some premium segment cars, instead what I see is this partnership is dragging down Toyota to Maruti levels.

There are vents inside the cabin to keep the battery cool. What happens when the car is stands still in an open parking during Indian summer for days or weeks? What is the impact? d. Is there an IP rating for the battery or compartment? What happens when the car moves through waterlogged streets? 2.

The P610 transaxle employs helical gears rather than the straight-cut spur gears employed in the earlier transaxles, and which run more smoothly and quietly, while also accommodating higher mechanical loads. a.

There are vents inside the cabin to keep the battery cool. What happens when the car is stands still in an open parking during Indian summer for days or weeks? What is the impact? Usually the hybrid battery is divided into many cells and there is usually a battery management module which keeps track of charging individual cells and discharging the ones that were charged earlier. The optimal algorithms are chosen here for cell longevity based on usage patterns and many other variables. Also, instead of changing the entire battery, it was always possible to change individual cells in earlier Toyota hybrids (Although those were NiMh cells and the cell replacement was a labor intensive process, dismantling rear seat back and all). However the Li-ion cells should have a much larger life than the Ni-Mh ones used in Toyota hybrids earlier. The heat generated also should be limited and controlled, as there is no fast charging or higher voltages present, unlike EV charging. Also the battery management module should intervene if such a scenario happens. Note: The above info is based on various documentation and experiences around the web, on repair and maintenance of earlier Toyota hybrid systems. However Toyota should advertise the costs involved in replacing the battery, how many charge cycles/KMs before it would require replacing etc, to ease off customer doubts. This is critical in calculating long term maintenance costs involved. After all, people tend to keep using cars with high economy/efficiency longer than less efficient ones.", 29th August 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Cochin,108,174

I have a 3 series for occasional joy ride and weekend quick drives. The Kodiaq does all long distance family trips and occasional weekend drives. Ecosport is being used for errands and Corolla for driver duties for my dad. I can easily get ride of the Ford and Corolla but will need one practical city commuter. Right now my 2 city use cars are manual and the highway cars are AT. Which is opposite of what it should be. With wfh and hybrid work from home, I don't need a daily office car which is what the Ecosport was. The Hyryder checks all the boxes. I get to remain within Toyota umbrella from Corolla. Gets amazing FE and being an automatic it's a breeze in traffic. Driver can drive for errands and I can use it when needed as well for short trips. Rear seat was decent in space and ride quality was good. I have the Kodiaq for boot space and luxury and the 3 for fun to drive. I am still not on the EV bandwagon and for me the Hybrid makes more sense than EV right now and even next 5 years. Few reasons are charging in my apt is difficult for an EV. A sub 4m SUV like Nexon is 20L even with all subsidies. Secondly the EV is more like a mobile phone / appliance. The battery will degrade over time. It's a massive cost to replace it. This means used market resale for EV will be poor as battery will have good degradation. Secondly EV's are getting better every year in range, power and battery tech. In 2 years the old Nexon is outdated and replaced with Max and the MG has got a big facelift and improved range. Hybrids will retain resale and will still be practical in used car market since the tech is already well established and well proven. I will wait for prices for the Hyryder and if it is below the City e:HEV it has a strong use case. It cannot cross the price of the Creta/Seltos diesel AT as the Hyryder is compromised in some ways.

Didn't mention anything about EVs in my post. Just Maruti's past behavior abusing hybrid-related tax exemptions where they didn't even bother providing a battery before calling their cars hybrid which resulted in the entire industry losing out on hybrid-related tax benefits. Hybrid as far as Maruti/Toyota is concerned is a technology to boost fuel efficiency and nothing else. This type of technology doesn't deserve any tax relief unless we provide similar tax relief to all fuel efficiency improvements in ICE cars. Just like GST is not the 10 commandments, we can't wait forever for monopoly discoms to magically improve the grid. There is no reason for them to do it because they don't have any competition. EVs will take off whether the grid is ready or not because India provides the biggest tax delta between ICE and EVs. We are seeing it already with 2Ws. If not for the supply chain constraints, we would've seen it in 4Ws as well.

124, d-g-p , 21:00 ,BHPian,"Thanks for the crisp and detailed review. Boot space is a let down for me like many others with mixed highway and city drive needs. Now considering down grading to neo drive. Even though full drive review of the mild hybrid (neodrive) is not yet available, general expectation out of this engine is like that of other K15C based cars with Global C platform launched recently. Nothing much exciting on card except for may be some refinement on ride quality. But even the top model of Neodrive ""V"" is going to miss out on features like TPMS, ventlated seats, wireless charging, HUD etc according to brochure. I feel at least the TPMS being a very important feature should have been included. Though TPMS is included as a genuine accessory, no confirmation as yet, if it will be compatible with the mild hybrid models. I am assuming the TPMS here is of ""direct"" type. The infotainment system on full hybrid model here is based on ""Smartplay Pro plus"" ?. This is mentioned to be of compatible with wireless android auto and carplay. Would it be same (wireless) for the mild hybrid (neo drive) top model ? Though both mild hybrid and full hybrid gets the same nomenclature, I believe both are essentially two very different cars targetting different buyer types.

128, RRU , 23:17 ,BHPian,"Bahut badhiya sameeksha (great review) BHPians  Vidyut and Eddy  as always. Hyryder (thereby Grand Vitara, as well) is a mixed bag like all other cars  there is nothing called perfect car, and we highlight pros and cons based on our requirements/convenience and outcome vis-à-vis expectation. I believe irrespective of OEMs (here MSL+TKM combined), over the past few years, we have been a witness to many new good cars rolling on our road successfully  this one will be no different. It will succeed. A lot of thinking and engineering go into making these cars although as end users we are at liberty to opine, and pass judgement, as well. I am seeing an interesting convergence and emulation of one anothers strengths by these OEMs  eventual beneficiary will be end users (and govt. of course that coughs up 43% tax  very high by any standards). MSL  known for offering no frills, VFM, low budget cars, is actually trying to premium-ise offerings via collaboration route (with TKM) through a dedicated channel of experience (NEXA) and adding features which hitherto have been the forte of Korean automaker (s). Reason is very simple  for long it held over 50% market share, which has now slipped to 43% and can slip further unless arrested  today we have options galore  not just budget tin cans. MSL knows this and doing its bits on safety, features and premium feeling. Hyundai and Kia  known for offering features up to brim, are actually trying to add safety as standard notwithstanding the initial jolt of lower than expected NCAP rating. Reason is simple  necessity cannot be covered up by offering good-to-have things (without any impact on utility, we can live without many of these). M&M and TaMo  Known for making robust vehicles but sans refinement and little or no customer experience  CV, fleet and tractor owners would not mind, but we do  they are learning and improving  results are so much visible. Safety in cars manufactured by the duo is kind of given  paaaanch (5*)  already challenged the dominancy of MSL and Hyundai. How assiduously TaMo transformed NEXON since its launch to the number 1 SUV (all SUV segments combined) now is commendable. Their investment in EVs is going to be game changer  but trust me only after a decade or more. We are still building roads gentlemen. EV infra is a distant dream. Toyota  Despite being no. 1 in the world (always for a reason), it never invested significantly in Indias mass market segments  quite conservative  happy with a few successful vehicles  enough to stay afloat and grow moderately  no one can ever take reliability and safety badge from it  tie up with MSL for rebadged products was a great move to test waters and roll out hybrids (more of its own versions to follow). Someone in the forum questioned Toyotas ability to survive in India after pulling out the most reliable vehicle in India  Innova and apparent failure of Hyryder  trust me, they are smarter than us and know exactly what to do  lets not be judgmental. Remember Qualis? Even a rebadged Brezza (Urban Cruiser, the outgoing model) sold over 6,700 units in July 2022 especially when new Brezza was already available. VW  Never gets its engineering and performance wrong (top notch) - had to increase VFM and wider reach proposition  Rapid, Taigun and Kushaq are great examples and many to follow Honda  They really need to shed that attitude. While City hybrid is a valiant attempt given its an iconic brand, in a world of SUVs and MPVs, not sure how long it will sustain. Someone told me  marketing at its best is to find a product that customers want and at its worst find customers for a product. Others  all others are following all or a combination of strategies highlighted supra. Appreciate that. Overall, I am happy to see the convergence and fierce competition in these segments  makes all comparable and gives us options to choose from. Coming specific to the SUV car we are discussing, I think its actually an URBAN CRUISER HYRYDER  made for city with high FE, can cruise easily, high GC helps manage tough Indian roads (I know how it is in Bangalore) and hybrid technology provides a better (than EV) transition to environment friendly urban mobility. A few important pointers that I believe are: 1) Being a Toyota car  reliability, safety and reasonable cost of ownership are given even if the car gives more Maruti than Toyota look. Toyota will never let dilute these USPs. 2) Looks are subjective  I really liked the Hyryder overall. Some may like Grand Vitara or Creta or Seltos and more  I like all these though. 3) A lot has been said about Maruti-like, not-so-plush interior features. Without seeing (the taste of the pudding is in the eating), I believe if my 9-year-old petrol Etios (all experts called it really cheap, frugal and fraught with cost cutting) interior and exterior and everything survived (save usual wear and tear and tyres) without much fuss in Bengalurus great road, I have no reasons to believe these are not robust enough to live or outlive their life. Beyond this, all opinions are subjective and purely personal. 4) FE of Hyryder/Grand Vitara is for real given this is strong Hybrid  I mean the more you drive in city (B2B or otherwise) the closer the actual mileage will be against the claimed 28 kmpl. Exactly opposite happens with ICE vehicles in city (lets limit to comparable ones). This is because of the technology employed  60% usage on electric/EV mode. So, the higher mileage is not just some innovation on ICE  it is due to strong hybrid. Hence, the troikas (Honda, Suzuki and Toyota) lobbying with North Block for tax relief/incentive is tenable and should be considered. Read this: As EVs Struggle To Win Indian Hearts, Honda Demands Tax Cut For Hybrid Vehicles (outlookindia.com) 5) Second row of most SUVs in this segment (especially for those who have always used sedans) is a compromise and it is always a point of less claustrophobic or more. If you see the dimension of Hyryder, its is fairly comparable with rest all and I never read in any review that says second row can accommodate three adults easily and has ample head and leg rooms. However, for tall people, this can be a deal breaker unless the back support recline is enough to offset the cramped headroom. 6) Boot space is a dampener, but I think Toyota-MSL were quite wary of that. As suggested by Vidyut, some additional space with optimization can be carved out, but on any given day it will be a compromise. 7) On pricing, I think if partnership with MSL has resulted in perceived compromise in quality of package then it could be a blessing when it comes to pricing. MSL is likely to keep the pricing of smart hybrid competitive even if it means overlap with Brezza (Arena) and XL6 (Nexa). Add some 2-3 lakhs premium over that for strong hybrid. That said, MSL will have more difficulty in positioning Grand Vitara than Toyota in positioning Hyryder. There is a huge space for Toyota to position this car. Given this, Toyota will have limited room to add premium. Prospective MSL customers will have to do a lot of math and brain wrenching to decide between mild vs strong hybrid. For Toyota customers  it should be simple as long as price is competitive. We all have a fair indication of price based on media leaks and guesstimates. 8) On performance, 3 cylinders and NVH  This could definitely dissuade enthusiasts (I am a bit though)  never had any difficulty is cruising at 120-140 kmph on highways (it does not beep also being an old car). I believe all BHPian are enthusiasts albeit at different levels of degree  is it really that difficult to add performance or rather leave performance undiluted in their utter zeal for fuel economy? They should have discussed with VW folks. To sum up  this is a strong contender  I will certainly taste it and then decide whether to bite or wait for them to learn and do course correction in next avatar or model (say HYCROSS).", 30th August 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,39,85

Whenever both petrol and diesel options are available, diesels sell at least 2x more than the petrol version. So, if they are able to pull off the hybrid story as an alternative to diesel, it could change the landscape. As for the driving characteristics, the electric motors in the hybrid offer reasonable torque for most situations in our driving conditions. In a value sensitive mass market, pricing is going to be the key. Otherwise, it could be a lost opportunity (like Honda City hybrid), and all investments that Toyota is doing for indegenizing the hybrid powertrain could be wasted. So they need to be treading the pricing aspects very cautiously, and look at this as a door opener for Hybrids. Quote: First of all my trusted SA said this is a car not for enthusiastic people.

143, Audik75 , 09:51 ,BHPian,"Having been an enthusiastic driver (in a different country where the legal speed was at times 140+kmph), I can safely say I am now a toned down kitna deti hai driver. Maybe it is the age factor or the Honda City CVT that I drive which has tuned me to be more linear with my driving speeds. I am a believer in Hybrids and am looking forward to this launch (a 4-cylinder engine would have been brilliant though). I have booked both cars in July. I should say the booking experience with Toyota does leave a lot to be desired which is why I booked the Maruti as a fail-safe. I prefer the Hyryder looks and the brown interiors (personal choice) which is why Toyota is first on my list however the entire sales experience has been underwhelming and Toyota needs to take away lessons from this. I should admit I got two calls from Lanson Toyota - once in error from a calling list and the second time to check if I was selling a used car. A question on when the Hyryder would be delivered meant a quick end to the call. On the contrary, Maruti has been really professional and has kept the engagement up even if nothing seems to be happening on either counter. Have heard great feedback about Toyota but it does seem that the Maruti processes are clearly superior as far as sales go. Or is this because it is a jointly developed product and Maruti has a greater interest in this? Maruti dealers appear the more hungry of the lot for sure. Given my sedate driving (mostly in the city) and penchant to cruise at 90 on the highways, this car fits the bill mostly.

They expect you to close your eyes and buy an Innova/Crysta for a lot of bucks. If you want anything else, you have to hold their beer. The engine noise is no surprise. The Etios 1.5l 4-cylinder petrol engine (2NR-FE?) is not particularly silent, and this new 1.5l is a 3-cylinder too. I was hoping it would have the Prius-C drivetrain whose petrol engine specs sounded identical to the petrol Etios', but no.

So here is my conclusion after trying to understand the technology, the car is dead if the hybrid battery is dead. 1. The car does not come with alternator(starter motor), the engine is started by the electric motors powered by hybrid battery. 2. Since the car does not have alternator, the 12V battery which is charged from dc-dc convertor from the hybrid battery also dies quickly. So all the car electrical are dead, no power windows and other stuff which run on 12V battery. 3. As we know without the gears and clutch the ICE powertrain stalls, since there is no clutch in this powertrain, the electric motor acts like a clutch and gear(eCVT), since the battery is dead and motors cannot run, the ICE engine cannot pull the car from standstill(if somehow you are lucky enough to start the engine).", 6th September 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,KA01/AP31,"1,172","3,338"

Price is as expected but still would say it's a premium than what is essentially an S-cross replacement and in some ways the S-cross is actually better. Few points: - 90K lower than the City Hybrid. Expected since the Honda adds ADAS and a more superior Hybrid drive train with 4 cylinder and the clever drive system. - 2L over non hybrid version is a tough sell especially since the neo drive is tuned for fuel efficiency. The Hybrid will give better FE in city but I suspect highway mileage for the neo drive will be better or on par. - Hybrid is 1L more than the Creta/Seltos diesel for top end.

If one is mainly inclined for a strong hybrid and agnostic about the form factor (crossover vs sedan) and is looking at the top variant at 18.99L, I see not much reason to go for a Toyota 3 cylinder hybrid without ADAS, when one can get a 4 cylinder Honda City Hybrid with ADAS at 20L. My sense is that the weak hybrid AT will also be priced just about 1.5L-2L lower than the same variant to make people jump for strong hybrid after doing the math calculations on fuel efficiency. But, but to me such comparison is an avoidable fallacious trap, since its not worth comparing a refined 4 cylinder weak hybrid to a not as refined 3 cylinder strong hybrid on the price differential perspective. I would love to compare the price difference between a 4 cylinder weak hybrid and a 4 cylinder strong hybrid, but such option does not exist as yet from Toyota. Maybe once the HyCross is launched, in both weak and strong variants, then a meaningful comparison is possible. I would put my money on Honda eHEV over HyRyder at current prices, if I had to buy today. A lot of people who are buying in this segment will go for automatic, so it makes sense for Toyota to squeeze as much margin as possible on the automatic.

The latter is pushing its strong hybrid keeping the mild-hybrid ones loftily priced while maintaining the prices of strong hybrid (its own TNGA product) fairly competitive (absolutely not for me if I do proper math) for city SUV users primarily, whether diesel or petrol. So, if they have hitherto received 75% of pre-booking for strong hybrids then now this proportion will increase to near 100% - there is no comparable product in Toyota stable that its strong hybrid or mild hybrid will overlap with - likely on road price of G variant of strong hybrid will be INR22L, which is equivalent to Crysta petrol base variant, but the latter is altogether a different segment. That said, when paying Rs.22+ lakhs for a city SUV, people will not compromise on boot space, lower headroom in rear seats and somewhat cramped space for fifth passenger not to talk of NVH at higher speed and somewhat lack of grunt. For MSIL, its XL6 and Brezza will compete with its own Grand Vitara mild hybrid. Members here have already opined - I agree in toto - on any day, I will prefer the VFM XL6 any variant over the Grand Vitara (MSIL version) or Hyryder. As far as the strong hybrid of MSIL is concerned, I don't thing the revenue arrangements between the two partners will allow MSIL to keep the prices lower than that of the comparable product of Toyota - here Toyota has advantage - of course, there are die hard fans of both the companies who would anyways buy their preferred OEM's car. Problems are cost, scale and margins - cost is dependent on scale and indigenization - which can happen over time.

It gives torque boost (not assist) till 4000 rpm and operates 60% of the time below 4000 rpm (that's what reviews claim) increasing efficiency as well.

235, ajayc123 , 07:02 ,BHPian,"Toyota is tactically pricing and positioning strong hybrids in a way that it cannot be compared to weak hybrids with equivalent engines. I don't know whether to call this smart tactics or being deceptive? Nevertheless, I have done some maths to assess the value proposition. For example, for the HyRyder, it did not choose to have a 3 cylinder weak hybrid variant. Let's us say they had one, could they have positioned a 3 cylinder top variant AT at 17L, like they have positioned the 4 cylinder AT top variant at 17L. My answer is No. Hypothetically, let's say if they had a top variant 3 cylinder weak hybrid AT, and that cannot sell at 17L, then the possible pricing which could have got traction at maybe 15L or 16L. This would translate to a premium of 3L to 4L for the equivalent strong hybrid variant. At such a pricing, the cost benefit analysis does not dictate even the recovery of premium paid for strong hybrid due to higher fuel efficiency, what to say about the compromises like higher NHV, and lower torque figures. ROI calculations between a 4 cylinder weak hybrid and 3 cylinder strong hybrid is like comparing apples to oranges. Now lets look at another perspective. I had recently noticed that crude price has started to drop and is currently around $85. With the buzz around recession, and massive electrification of passenger vehicles, the crude demand will go south gradually, and prices may stay muted at best. So our fears about higher fuel prices in the next few years may be an illusion, and this provides a further dent into the cost benefit calculations for a Hybrid. Probably, this is the last ditch effort by Toyota to recover its investments in Hybrid technologies before they become irrelevant with the larger scale adoption of EVs.", 10th September 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Delhi,917,"2,363"

While fuel efficiency of Creta is half of HyRyder in congested city driving, but at highway cruising in top gear, the fuel efficiency can be expected to be similar for both cars.

After looking at the price differential, V is out of the question, choice boils down to G and S variant. Open to suggestions. This is what I did to estimate the VFM when in dilemma between two variants of same car. I did it for both Brezza and Grand Vitara mild hybrid (waiting for price release to know how much value is off from cost differences). I added a value that I am willing to pay based on how important the feature is to me for each differing features. This is not how much each feature may cost, as I am calculating value proposition of the features as opposed to the cost of making it. For example, I would pay 15k for 9"" screen over 7"" screen, or 6k for 2 tweeters, and whopping 80k for 4 extra airbags as safety is high value in my list (though actual cost of 4 airbag setup may be much less). That make value difference between GV Delta to Zeta as 1.59L for me. This applies to Neo Drive S to G also as they come with same feature set. Now if cost difference comes approx in same range, then I would consider Zeta or Neo Drive G is better VFM compared to Delta or S variant respectively. Either you could indulge in this VFM micro-calculation like me, or consider TBHPian @PrideRed suggestion and go for G.

Is there a brand associated with it like JBL or Harman or Bose? 3 other buyers and I were discussing the car and when I was asked which I variant I booked and why. I booked the G variant because- I don't really need TPMS because I fill up my tyres with nitrogen so I just get it topped up by the end of every month. Never really felt the need for it. I don't need 360 degree camera because I am an experienced driver and I can parallel park, judge and maintain my distances well. Don't need ventilated seats because I've been living without them all my life and still haven't felt the need for them. I tried it in the Camry and Creata and I felt it wasn't a life changing thing to have. Honestly I'm afraid they would amplify and funny smells ifykwim. I love listening to music while driving so what I really needed was the premium speaker upgrade which now we know can be added through accessories, so when yesterday I tested out the speakers of the mild hybrid top V model with the regular system It sounded quite nice to me, better than my 2018 Honda City which has always been my benchmark in terms of sound quality. Hyryder's stock system has an amazing bass response and clarity so I don't think i would even add that now. I'll have to check out the one on the top V variant to make a final decision. Also I think it MIGHT be the JBL speakers from the fortuner that they'll be using, not sure so don't take my word for it.

This is the most common misconception regarding these two vehicles. If you're going for the hybrid then your parts related to the power train will be replaced under Toyota since they're using the TNGA 3cyl Engine and hybrid system made by Toyota. However if you're going for the mild hybrid one your parts will be handled by suzuki. Everything else is similar in these cars. Labour charges might vary but the cost of the parts that you end up breaking won't.

Even real world driving conditions may affect these calculations. For example you may achieve a certain result at 70 kmph on the highway, but would you get the same result, if you are driving at 100 kmph? I would probably do two extreme scenarios, 100 % city (best case) and 100% highway, and then interpolation between them is easier. For 100% city probably it may be 10 kmpl with non hybrid and 20 kmpl with Hybrid (it could be more if you don't use AC or heating).

331, Audik75 , 10:26 ,BHPian," Quote: Originally Posted by reppy I also think that if you have more of in city driving, the strong hybrid will easily outperform the mild hybrid and bring down the ROI period quickly. Agree. The strong hybrid is expected to perform better in city driving conditions and payback will be faster than 10 years. Another relevant comparison is to diesels where there is a difference of ~1.5L to the Korean cousins. Breakeven in this case will be around 75K kilometers assuming INR 2 savings per kilometer. Simple thumb rule I am using is fuel efficiency in real world at 80% of ARAI figures and petrol / diesel at 104 and 95. The strong hybrid buying rationale in a strict sense cannot be seen only in financial terms as a payback of 6+ years is not a worthy investment especially given the power ratios and fit-and-finish cannot be equated to the Korean or German cars. Then who is the target buyer? IMO, this is a car that's probably for: 1. Customers who have primarily city driving conditions to deal with. 2. Sedate drivers who rarely drive in triple digit speed on highways. 3. People seeking the peace of mind associated with the Maruti / Toyota cars (not that there are no gripes) 4. Petrolheads (one can include the NCR folks also here I guess) 5.

Based on your ride the savings would vary from 5-10 km/l but it would be difficult to reach breakeven cost. Q. So, Does paying the extra premium for Hybrid justifiable? If you are considering savings through milage then only to a certain extent and not justified at all. However if you consider 15BHP additional power, smooth eCVT, better center of gravity due to battery pack and then the hybrid tech then it does make sense in the age of EVs. Better tech is always reserved for the riches and developed world due to its affordability. Even if this tech is available in developed markets for quite sometime it would have been a failure in developing countries like ours due to limited spending capability of mass market. That is why even today SUZUKI is undefeated champion in the top selling segment not because of quality or technology but affordability. Over years Toyota have optimized the cost of Hybrid tech and with Suzuki they are able to bring it down further which will definitely create a competition for others to provide similar tech at lower prices. Even today long range performance EVs cost 40-50 lakhs+ which is reserved for premium segment. But someday that tech would be cheaper and will be achievable for mass market consumers.

So inflation of petrol is almost 2x the inflation of everything else in the last 6 years and this trend will definitely continue as the Ukraine crisis continues unabated and promises to be long term crisis. So over a 10 year life-span we would be under-valuing the fuel efficiency gains if we just used today's fuel prices to compare strong hybrid and normal cars. For the strong hybrid you pay the cost differential upfront and it is clear and tangible what the additional cost is. Whereas the additional benefit will happen over a span of time, that is probably going to see very high fuel prices and I would not be surprised if over this time, petrol touches Rs. 200 per litre.

Whenever I found a empty patch I accelerated hard to check the pickup and I could hear the 3 pot like any other car. I always wondered how people say high or low NVH because to do that shouldn't we all drive in a empty stretch of highway at a constant speed for few KMs with decibel meters and then compare? Anyhow I felt that a hyundai 1.5l or Honda 1.5l 4 cylinder is way more silent than this one but that's how it should be. Do we have another 3 cylinder 1.5 l in the market to compare? 2. No I was not able to notice any other sound other than the rustling of the plastic cover on the seat (whis was irritating and uncomfortable) When I started the car it was on battery so no sound and only when I pressed the pedal I could hear the engine coming to life. Also, I believe it needs more experience to notice such sounds which I might lack. Sorry. 3. As per the dealer ICICI Lombard is the only one providing such insurance.

These batteries have been known to work even 15 years if you read reviews of Toyota hybrids and the manufacturers offer 8 year warranty in India which is pretty decent. By this yardstick, EVs shouldnt sell at all given the battery costs will be significantly more in that use case. One doesnt know which way the battery cost will go in 8 years assuming we hit a failure immediately after warranty - it may be a lot less (if we consider the way electronics prices trend. My rationale is that one doesnt base a buying decision on a failure factor that has a (low?) probability of occurrence after 8 years (@10% of the buying cost).

Prices of battery or any other parts or accessory might increase or decrease after 8-10 years based on actual demand. Toyota and Maruti are providing 8 years warranty on battery. I dont think we should make it a deal breaker as current prices are likely to decrease with battery demand likely to rise in all probability and prices going down. However we know there is a cost after 8-10 years for battery replacement. There is a cost of tyre replacement for all cars as well !! If the running is high (15-20k km per year or above) and most part of it inside City limits, Hybrids would make sense.", 2nd October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Guwahati,104,208

374, smilingakash , 11:44 ,BHPian,"Guys, the Hyryder is now widely available at most Toyota dealerships. So take a stroll and observe the underpinnings. I spent 20 mins with the vehicle with my family over the weekend. Observed the top model 'V' variant which I have booked. Exterior- I was amazed by how long the car is. Proportionate and loved its commanding presence. The car will not disappoint you on this front. I was wondering for such a long and wide car why the interior looks cramped. Interior 1. Rear seat- 4 full size adults and a Pint-Sized child or 3 Petite Adults at best. 2. Boot- We all know it was small. However, if you are willing to keep the parcel tray and battery tray at home, the space is just about passable. For a family of four on a 1 week trip, there will always be a bag or two on the rear seat. 3. Cabin-- Looks compact and gives a feeling of less room. However, the leg room is very decent. 4. Interior-- Electronics from Maruti, but seats and soft touch design elements have been borrowed from Fortuner/Innova. 5. Instrument Cluster- Impressive, the top-variant will not disappoint you here. 6. Music System- Could not make out much, but SA mentioned of a superior quality music system on the top model. Test Drive & Availability Test Drive- Should be available by next week. They were sending vehicles to stockyard . Uttam Toyota had 3 colors available when I arrived, they kept one for display and had plans to send rest to stock yard. Allotment- I booked really early (Earlier than the official launch). As a matter of fact, I only paid 11K as booking amount. Mine was Dual Tone Enticing Silver+ Black roof. Had some doubts on the color when we saw the dirty and muddied car. The SA (Navin) was very helpful, he got the car cleaned and we were sold on the color combination. We were told, our model and color combination is 2nd on the list (Only one other potential buyer had booked the same combination earlier with the dealer). High chance of getting the car in the 1st allotment itself and delivery could happen in this month only At max, should get it in the next allotment. According to SA, there is one allotment to them every month. Under each allotment, they get a fix number of cars+color combination by Toyota. Will do a test drive next week. As long as the car has decent low end torque, good suspension & handling and is able to negotiate initial acceleration, then I am satisfied.

381, rahulcmoulee , 14:37 ,BHPian,"Visited Ravindu Toyota as they had received a display car. It was Red Dual tone V Hybrid variant. My observations are as follows: 1.) Exterior looks were good. Looked pretty substantial and had a decent footprint. Fit and Finish also seemed to match segment standards. No uneven panel gaps and paint finish was good. 2.) The doors were pretty light as you would expect from a Maruti car. The dashboard design was good and visibility was very good. Seats were comfortable and it was easy to get into a comfortable driving position. 3.) Interior quality is one of the big let downs. The quality of materials used felt like they didn't belong on a car which costs nearly 24L OTR in Bangalore. The soft touch inserts on the dash felt particularly cheap and the plastics were also hard and scratchy. Lots of parts sharing from lower Maruti cars. Cars like the Creta, Seltos and Astor felt much more premium inside. 4.) Rear seat is the second weakness of this car. Legroom is decent but cabin width is very tight. 3 abreast in the back is manageable only for very short journeys. Headroom is also very limited. My head was constantly brushing against the roof (I'm 6 feet tall). I had to slide quite far down the seat compromising thigh support and legroom in order to stop my head hitting the roof. Good to see the inclusion of a headrest and 3 point belt for the middle passenger but it's a shame that the space is so tight. 5.) The boot as everyone already knows is pretty tight. Adjusting the floor does liberate some space. Should be manageable for a weekend trip. Longer trips will be a struggle. 6.) Talking about the features, the sunroof is pretty big and both panes open up which is a segment first. The sunroof film is pretty thin and even the showroom lights were piercing through. 360 degree camera was good but quality could've been better. Ventilated seats worked a treat and are a must have for Indian conditions according to me. Music system sounded good and seemed to be on par with competitors. Infotainment screen seemed responsive enough though still not quite as good as the Sync3 system in my current Ecosport. Wireless Apple Carplay worked well and connection was fast. Heads up Display was nice to have but it should have provided navigation directions too. 7.) Quoted waiting period of 3-4 months but top end variants should be available sooner. Mild Hybrid deliveries will take a while to commence. Seems like MS is focusing on the mild hybrid and Toyota on the strong hybrid. No TD available today as RTO formalities were still not completed. Should be available by Friday. Decent crowd had turned up to the showroom to look at the car. The most crowded I've seen a Toyota dealership in a while. Could not take any pictures as it was pretty crowded and there were people all around the car which was surprising on a Monday afternoon. Clearly shows that this car has generated a lot of interest. All in all this car seems to be focused solely on fuel efficiency. This should make for a very good city runabout but the lack of space and grunt might limit its highway capabilities.

The place was buzzing with activity since the car was unveiled only today and test drives were being offered too. What I liked: 1. Looks better, way better, in real than in pictures 2. Dual variants on display - Blue, Red and the Silver - look fabulous too 2. The design is elegant and sort of conservative 3. Clean and contemporary interiors - combination of dark tan, black and silver go well 4. Comfortable and relaxed driving position with multiple adjustment levels 5. Easy ingress and egress for the rear seats 5. Crossover-like appearance rather than an imposing SUVish stance (not necessarily a like or a dislike) What I did not: 1. Boot space on the strong hybrid appear to take a max of 2 mid/large suitcases (see pics below) 2. Doors don't feel as heavy as they do in my S-Cross 3. Steering feels dated and boring. A flat bottom design could've made a difference Observations from a short test drive: 1. Drivers seat offers a commanding view with a comfortable position 2. The car pulls away really effortlessly with response from ICE kicking in seamlessly and noiselessly 3. Acceleration is fast and smooth. I was able to get to 65 kmph real quick on a short open stretch Have asked for a longer test drive to understand better how the hybrid drives.

It is a Petrol AT and due to the lockdown, I've driven it for less than 9000 kms so far. However, with schools reopening and getting back to office, I drive about 40 kms on a daily basis now and get a mileage of 9km/l with only city driving (often during peak times in slow moving traffic). I hardly make trips out of town but that is something I am thinking about doing in the near future although I would still be driving 98% of the time in the city. With Ford out of India, I was looking to sell my car before the value depreciates even further (Spinny was offering 10.5L & OLX at 10.2L the last time I checked 2 months ago). I am considering the Hyryder (G variant) mainly due to the FE as I'm not too optimistic on the fuel prices going lower than what it currently is. Infact I wouldn't be surprised we touch Rs. 150/l in 2023. Do you think an upgrade to the hybrid would be smart or should I stick to the Ecosport for another couple of years?

Thanks in advance! With your current usage, the hyryder might make sense. But have you thought about future usage as well ? ( Read 5 - 10 years down the line ). Even though the power train is very efficient, the hyryder has a few fundamental problems. Since the hybrid battery is positioned at the wrong place, the practicality of the boot is severely compromised. 3 cylinder engine means it's not going to be a refined driving experience on the highway. In the city, you might not feel it much though since electric motor helps for bulk of the typical city use case. Rear head room is poor thanks to that afterthought sunroof design. Rear seat recline angle is not great. Again, more relevant for highways. But not sure if it's important for you in the long run. In addition, I remember someone complaining about left knee of the driver irritatingly rubbing against the plastic. I wouldn't compromise on ergonomics for a primary car.

Thanks in advance! Given your daily running of 40km, which can translate to 15k kms a year, and escalating fuel prices, the Hyryder offers a good alternative. Your Ecosport has not depreciated much yet, and the bulk of the depreciation is yet to come. Totota cars have a tendency to appreciate in value or at least hold their pricing ground, especially considering the long warranty period offered. By investing another 10 lakhs plus the resale value of your Ecosport, you could have a nicely equipped G variant of the strong hybrid Hyryder in your garage shortly. The fuel cost savings given your city commute will easily be Rs. 75000 a year considering your running, assuming your Ecosport yields 10 kpl and the hybrid will yield 20kpl. If you were to deposit the money (10 lakhs) in a bank, you will earn less than this as interest. So it is a cost neutral proposition and you at least get to enjoy the additional features, the prestige of driving a higher segment car and also probably arrest the depreciation loss to a large extent..", 5th October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Chennai,"2,220","9,796"

Innova and Fortuner has a chain & pulley mechanism to lower and hoist the spare wheel and keep it locked. Its lowered and pulled back up using the jack rod inserted horizontally into the slot in the bumper after opening the boot hatch. Hyryrder, Grand Vitara has XL6/Ertiga type spare wheel cage carrier which drops down when loosening a bolt in the boot floor which loosens the J hook holding the cage. The cage will not fully drop down, and for that the ""J"" hook needs to be moved out of the way and cage lowered (and raised) by hands. Having operated both types I find the chain and pulley type easier to work with especially while lifting the wheel back up. The cage carrier type is cumbersome with larger wheels. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CELURvbZpy8 ", 5th October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Location,"5,766","9,047"

I don't see why it should be relevant in this case because 1.The car just came out and is a new release. 2. December-January is just a 30 day difference and only the registration can be 2023. 3. Can't get a freshly baked car out of the Toyota oven right in January. 4. For it to be a 2023 model it should get a face-lift in 2023.

Very very seamless transmission - Road noise does get through but overall refinement is very good - Easy to drive and good suspension setup for the city - Felt different from a conventional CVT wherein there was no feeling of gears being shifted at all - I am a sedate driver and definitely thought the engine had enough poke to keep you interested in the city. It felt peppier than the K15C-equipped 2022 Brezza I drove a month or so ago All in all, doesn't work for my requirements because my family is pretty tall.

Couldn't get a test drive today so it was just a walkaround/ingress/egress and here are a couple of thoughts for what they are worth:The car looks good in person where it looks pretty vanilla on the website. Sober but far from anodyne. I'm 6' 1"" and can't possibly sit in the rear without fearing a concussion or two. The SA claims it is down to aerodynamics . Didn't have my family along so can't comment on the bench width (didn't look any worse visually than what I saw recently with the German twins) but there was decent room to spare for my knees. The headroom in the front isn't bad, on the other hand, but the door opening has been squashed which means that I had to sway to my right during both ingress and egress. It was either that or bash my head against the door opening top point. I'm told I can have a test drive in a day or two but I don't know if I can look past the dodgy headroom.", 7th October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,6,9
412, 84.monsoon , 13:11 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"The on-line booking process that Toyota has established is very poor. I tried to book the Hyryder G strong Hybrid and the process started last Wednesday Sep 28th. I selected Lanson Toyota in Cenotaph Road Chennai as the dealer while booking. I sent through the web form and tried to make payment through my credit card. The payment page hangs and would not go through after entering all card details. I tried three times and gave up. Tried again with g-pay. I had to re-enter all information each of the 4 times I tried to book, as the site has no user log-in or persistence of information. It is just like a google form that collects some info and then re-directs you to a payment page. I finally paid via g-pay and all the site provides is a payment confirmation stub of google pay. There is no return to Toyota booking page and no confirmation of the transaction from the Toyota page. This looks like a site and process that a flower shop would design and build to take orders for flowers and make payments. This is not the kind of design one of the world's largest auto manufacturers should hove for booking their 20 lakh rupee cars I then received an e-mail from Toyota - a barebones e-mail saying the booking is done, but with no details of the variant booked, dealer booked with, amount paid or booking priority number. Two days later I received a call from the dealer. All that the SA knew was that a booking had been done for Hyryder at their dealership. He had no idea of the variant, color or even whether the strong hybrid or weak hybrid had been booked. I had to repeat all this information again and asked for the payment receipt and the booking confirmation with variant details and booking priority number. The SA now asks me to send Aadhar Card and PAN card and says this is mandatory to issue booking receipt! In the next few hours I received no less than 5 calls/WhatsApp pings from the SA - Each time asking for one additional bit of information. I think he was trying to go through and fill up a booking form and each new field he came to and he realized he did not have the information, he would call me. I asked him if he received the information from the Toyota booking site, where I had already keyed in most of the information he was asking for, and he says he did not receive any details other then the fact that a customer had booked a Hyryder with the dealership! So he wanted variant and color again, then wanted back side of Aadhar card, then the e-mail ID, and then even nominee details! God knows why one needs a nominee when booking a car! He then asks for the booking payment receipt and UPI transaction ID. Although I sent him whatever I received as part of the process, he was not satisfied and wanted the UPI transaction ID, which was not available on the gpay receipt nor the e-mail from Toyota. I told him this is all the information I have and you have to work with this. I then asked for the payment receipt. The SA then tells me that the google payment would have gone to the ""Lanson Corporate Account"" and it will take 3 days to reach the dealership account, and only then can he make out a payment receipt! After insisting I need something, he sends me a photo of a half-filled written, manual booking form, in which he gets the nominee relationship and age wrong - I inform him of the error and he says he has corrected it. I insist on the corrected form and sometime later I get another photo of another written form - this time the nominee details are thankfully correct. Three days go by and I again follow up for a proper payment receipt and booking confirmation. ""Sir, payment is not reflecting yet"" is the answer. Same answer on the next day and I then got busy with work and forgot about this. I again message him this morning (Oct 8th) about it and finally I received the Computer generated ""Customer Receipt"" - 10 days after I booked and paid. It has an Order Number but this seems local to the dealer. No national booking ID reflecting priority number is provided. Compare this to M&M - when I booked the Thar 2 years ago, and also when I booked the Scorpio N recently, I got the complete booking receipt and booking ID immediately after I completed the payment. I can go an check the status of my booking anytime by logging into the portal provided by M&M. I can see the sequence of steps from ""Order under Planning"" to ""Being produced"" to ""In transit for delivery"" etc. in the portal. With Toyota, I cannot even retrieve my booking on the site as they have no log-in functionality. One has to relay entirely on the goodwill of the dealer to get the status and the delivery. I think as leading global car manufacturer, Toyota should set up a more robust, customer friendly process. The process should ensure the details of the order reaches the dealer in its entirety. They should also train their SAs to create booking receipts without calling and messaging the customer half a dozen times. These are basics without which a manufacturer has no right to do business in today's times.", 8th October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Chennai,"2,220","9,796"

My over all experience with Maruti Nexa website booking is not much different either. I did an Urban cruiser hyryder booking with Toyota dealer but opted for online booking with Grand Vitara. Calls from dealer came after 2-3 days and almost same process to go through. They too faced same issues with payment confirmation from Nexa. Interestingly while I booked a Grand Vitara Alpha+ Nexa blue AT (Other colour options were not available initially) later I found the same being converted to Zeta MT when I logged in after few days. Nexa SA assured me of converting this to Alpha+ AT or any other variant after price announcement. At least in Maruti Suzuki Nexa you can log on and cancel the booking from the website itself.

414, Upgrade , 18:19 ,BHPian,"Today I visited Ravindu in OMR, Bangalore for a test drive with an objective of driving it on highway. The following are my observations: Car looked shorter but when I saw it next to a Creta, they were of same height. So, it is just my perception issue. The tan colour interior is very good. The boot space is small. But you can expand it by removing the hardboard and you can even remove the tools section and free up another 50 litres. But you need to find another place to keep them. SA was suggesting that as an option. You can expect some kind of mats to be available soon for the tools section to improve the boot space. The driver seat can be raised pretty high. With sunroof open, you will get a feel of sitting in a convertible as your head will be so close to the open space. About the drive - I drive Etios Petrol and found Hyryder responsive. Anyone who is coming from NA vehicle will not find this under powered. I drove till 120 and I don't think highway overtaking will be a major issue in the sport mode. The big issue is the noise. The noise is at par with my 11 year old Etios even at the lower speed. The mileage shown on the MID was 15 kmpl. So for a highway drive at higher speed, you may not see major gain compared to other petrol cars and will be more expensive than diesels.", 8th October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,114,169

I am really not sure about the mileage of the hybrid as the display was showing 16KMPL most of the times, So we will have to wait and see. One thing the Toyota SAs sell hard is on the Toyota's 3 Years warranty and 8 year warranty on the battery. I did place the booking for the base variant S of the hybrid as it covers most of the features that i want.

416, RRU , 21:34 ,BHPian,"Today, i finally test drove Hyryder (strong hybrid) - V in red colour - looks stunning - first at Ravindu Toyota, Avalahalli, Bangalore to get a sense of highway ride and then another short ride at Nandi, Whitefiled. Also, had a peek into strong hybrid G-midnight black, V-blue and Neodrive S-white - all look stunning, especially from outside, well nigh all angles. Here are my thoughts based on TDs: 1) Overall ride quality is very good - more so for city driving and highway drive was not half bad either. 2) Suspension was a wee bit on the tighter side, but absorption of undulations or varied road conditions was never an issue - good. 3) Performance was acceptable (don't want to overstate, but it can be easily construed as ""good"") in all kinds of driving - drove at 0-122 kmph in almost all conditions. At slow speed up to 50 kmph, it is a veritable EV with absolutely no sound or fuss whatsoever. The switch between EV and ICE is just seamless and so also the e-cvt - you will never notice the continual switch and transmission. That said, to gain this you have to play soft pedal and sudden acceleration or quick throttle response is always accompanied by sound you will likely not like and it indeed beats (pun intended) my Etios 1.5 petrol NA on NVH. Power or response to kick will not be an issue up to 140 kmph (i think this is enough), but that NVH will bother you for sure (3-cylinder engine bane) and more so since it runs on EV at low speed - hence the boom is more prominent. 4) Mileage - Given the TDs were full of varying speeds, sudden acceleration, deceleration and all kind of stress test - overall mileage of the first trip was 15+ kmpl and second ride was 18+ kmpl. Impressive but mind you not a big leap from mild hybrid/Neo drive (my TD of XL6 MPV eked out a mileage of 15 kmpl). 5) Inside the cabin - A lot has already been talked about by BHPian friends and experts - only incremental points - first row, driving seat: very comfortable and decent ergonomics for all types of driving position and style provided you are not more than 6'1"". Only issue i noticed was left knee rubbing the dashbaord when i put my foot on dead pedal - not sure if others felt, but was not enjoying at all. Co dirver's seat was comfortable with enough leg, elbow and headroom. Second row as averred by everyone was indeed a dampener - 3 average or lean adults can sit comfortably, but ceratainly not in ""Seth ji"" style. While the comfort of a typical sedan was definitely conspicuous by its absence, it should be acceptable given the segment it belongs to and the design. Headroom was definitely a deal breaker for me and could be for many - however, there is a positive surprise i noticed albeit at the cost of the sought after ""sunroof"" feature - the S variant of Neodrive (probably strong hybrid, as well; will check), which is sans sunroof - has much better headroom and i really liked - that claustrophobic feeling was not there. Just to give a comparision - i am 6' - my head was rubbing (not touching) the roof of G/V strong hybrid with sunroof when i sat upright in the second row vs a gap of at least 2 inches when seated in the same position in the second row of Neodrive S variant. 6) Boot space was claimed about 250L for strong hybrid, about 341L after removing the trays and about 400L in Neodrive - i am fine with these and will not consider it a deal breaker. 7) Build and Safatey were kind of in the middle - Maruti-Toyota - certainly not usual Toyota type, but strong enough to grab an NCAP rating of 4*. To sum up - it is a very good package at a little premium price - courtesy all stakeholders, including govts, and competes well with the Korean, German and Indian counterparts.", 8th October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,39,85
417, Cruzn , 12:51 ,BHPian,"So I went to the Nandi Toyota in Banaswadi for a test drive yesterday. We were the first ones there and while waiting for the SA to arrive, we took a look at the S & the V variants they had on display. - I’m 5’11 and even with the driver’s seat set to my position (which was all the way back) there was still room to sit comfortably in the backseat. - Headroom was a little limited both in the front and the back but it kind of grows on you and I forgot about it after a while. - Space is limited in the back and definitely not for 3 adults. By then the SA (Richard) reached and suggested we take the test drive as he was expecting other customers to come check out the vehicle soon. - They had the V variant for TD and as mentioned by many already, you switch the car on and you don’t hear a thing. It was quite amazing. - Release the brake and the car moves instantly without any lag. - Before we moved any further, I asked the SA to reset the mileage. - The drive was pretty good. Way better than I expected. Got to drive through city traffic and potholes as well as a bit of the open road to really see how the pick up was. The pick up is not as great as my ecosport, but it was quite smooth otherwise and managed to get through the potholes with ease. My family in the back said they hardly felt anything. - We drove for a little more than 3 kms and when I saw the mileage, it was a whopping 24 km/l!! I was on EV mode for at least 80% of the time and the time I realised that the ICE kicked in was when I looked at the infotainment screen which showed the orange engine light up. Otherwise you don’t even realise it. By the time we got back, the place was packed with a lot of people. I barely got out of the vehicle and had people running over to hop in for their test drive. I then asked the SA to get a box or a suitcase to check the boot capacity. He managed to find a huge box, the size of a large suitcase. It didn’t fit in. However, he did remove the parcel tray and it went in just right with a little more room for an extra backpack or 2. I wasn’t a fan of the thin sheet covering the sunroof. In fact, upon touching the sun roof, it was quite hot even on a gloomy day. As the AC was on, It didn’t feel so hot inside the car. I asked the SA if reflective tints could be installed and he said it could be done. Hopefully this could help keep the cabin cooler. The SA mentioned that they only started test drives at their branch from Saturday evening and already had 36 bookings since then. Overall I was quite pleased with the vehicle and left with a booking of the G variant.

Pros : 1 - Silent until 40 -50 kmph 2 - Pickup is decent and better than I expected looking at the bhp figures. 3- Interiors feel plush. I also like the back seat recline angle.

423, contentedbloke , 00:39 ,BHPian,"I checked out the Hyryder at Lanson Toyota, Chennai. While the vehicle looks great and the blue is a beautiful colour, there were a couple of things which I couldn't appreciate: 1. The driver seat is quite narrow. On top of that, there is a small bolster at the edge of the sides which presses into the thighs. On short trips, i might not notice it. But anything longer than an hour, I'm pretty sure this would be uncomfortable. Even the Hyundai i10 has wider seats than the Hyryder. How could Toyota get something so basic wrong? 2. The front and rear entry frame have a high lip - basically we have to manouver our leg a little high to get over the lip and into the seats. This kinda of defeats the purpose of an SUV's USP of easy ingress and egress. 3. The vehicle seems large - larger than a Creta but the inside doesn't seem more spacious than the creta. I thought this was a negative since it makes it difficult to drive and park in the city compared to a more compact SUV which offers the same amount of space. I know this is highly subjective since there are some who prefer a larger road presence but to me that's a negative. To be honest, the other issue which keeps cropping up - reduced bootspace - didn't seem that much of an issue.

424, itsmystyle07 , 09:07 ,Newbie,"Checked out the Hyryder at Anamalais Toyota Coimbatore on Sunday. They had registered and kept one neodrive and hybrid for test drives ready. Display vehicles were available in blue, red with black DT and silver colours. Blue wasnt that attractive for me. Red was more of a maroonish red. Both red and silver looked superb. My observations. 1. Exterior Looks are personal. Although i feel its the most handsome of the mid size SUV lot. Close second are seltos and kushaq. Far better looking than grand vitara. 2. Interiors - i was personally happy. Comes with all the necessary features expected in this segment. Main things missing compared to koreans are electronic parking brake and powered drivers seat. But in my opinion, i would rather have features which cant be added like ventilated seats, HUD over those. You can still use parking brake manually and adjust the seats manually. So why does it matter !! Wireless android auto and carplay were seamless during test drive which arent there in the koreans.Audio quality was decent. 360 degree camera does the job. Quality is average. 3. Space and comfort - all the seats are comfortable with good finish. Rear seat space is good. comfortable for 3 leans adults or 2 adults and a child. Safety feature like 3 point seatbelt for all 3 rear seats is welcome. As far as rear seat headroom, i am 6 foot and in sunroof version, i didnt have an issue per se. I had like 3 fingers between myself and roof. Taller passengers would feel a bit uncomfortable. In the non-sunroof version, headroom is ample though. I had like half a feet between my head and roof. Another unusual thing i found is the ingress into the rear seats. Although they are high, the roof is low. Hence you have to bend your back a bit to enter. Still better than a sedan. Boot space is definitely less in hybrid. But not a dealbreaker if you are a small family. Can easily accomodate weekend luggage if you remove the floor board. 4. Drive - test drove the hybrid version. I recently test drove all mid size SUVs like kushaq, taigun, creta. Hands down this is the best for urban rides. Its just so silent. And the performance was surprising for its numbers. The engine kicks on at around 40kmph. The transition is seemless and you wont feel a thing if you have music on. Acceleration is superb at low speeds. Reaches 60kmph in a flash. Honestly for urban rides, this felt better than the taigun/kushaq/creta turbo. They have the irritating turbo lag at low speeds. I didnt feel that in this. Quick overtakes are a breeze. Couldnt test the high speed behaviour. But the reviews have already spoken about it. I have booked the top end V hybrid variant in black. Awaiting the delivery. Since most of my travelling is to work, i am going ahead with my booking. If your main aim is highway travel or if you are a large family, this might not be ideal for you. The top ends are a bit expensive. But i see the lower variants selling like hot cakes easily.", 12th October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Coimbatore,16,26

Interior things like switches, steering wheel, sun blind for the sunroof are definitely a step down from the Korean and German twins. However the eCVT reliability, performance and smoothness, added mileage and better safety ratings (hopefully) offsets them with a wide margin.

The functions of the display vehicle was pleasing to have. It includes a 360-degree camera, a head-up screen and a panoramic sun roof. 3. Panoramic sunroof is good and large, but it is hard on the eyes to see the fabric mesh underneath as protection. This has not been to our liking. 4.

434, tjsi , 19:57 ,BHPian,"Took a test drive of the V Hybrid variant today. A Toyota Fortuner and Honda City owner's perspective. My city is my daily but today i drove to the showroom in the fortuner to compare the experience. 1. I noticed is that on the driver side your left knee does touch against the center console but right knee gets too much free space. I forgot about it after I started driving and my knee rested on the console naturally. No annoying rubbing or knocking. 2. The car turns on like a smart phone. You press the power button and just put it in drive and go. No sound, nothing. It felt very satisfying and I was impressed. Didn't even have to wait for the engine to warm up or anything. 3. Since I drove my fortuner to the showroom, the ride quality felt far better than the fortuner and the hyryder absorbs bumps like a champ. I did feel them but not as much as my city and fortuner. 4. HUD is pretty useless and felt like a gimmick since the digital cluster is still working along with it. I might not even use it after the first week of getting the car. 5. The car picks up to 60km/h pretty quickly. The car drives up to 45Km/h in full EV mode before it says ""EV MODE CANCELLED"" on the digital cluster and turns on the engine, which is amazing because you just don't feel it turn on. No vibration, no sound, it's seemless. If you're coming from a NA car then the performance will not disappoint. It's actually much better than the other NA cars. The one thing I don't understand is that the car would sometimes drive in the EV mode from a stop and sometimes it use the ICE. I expected it to always pick up with EV mode but I guess we'll find out more later. 6. My dad who is 5'10 and wears a turban (5'11"" total) and loves to critique every little thing about everything was sitting in the back said the back seat was good enough. His head was not touching the roof or hitting the sides. He was specifically looking for those two things and it didn't happen. He seemed happy with the back seat experience. 7. The sunroof is kind of noisy, sounds like a vacuum cleaner. The sunroof is forced upon you from the G Hybrid variant and I would definitely trade it for the ventilated seats. The film is definitely thin but it's fine. You forget about it after a while and it doesn't let any annoying glare or flickering from the tree leaves through 8. The brakes were very sensitive but I'm sure it needs more breaking in (pun intended) before we get the optimal performance out of it. The steering is light and precise. 9. The doors aren't as light as some members claim. They're just fine. The build quality is comparable to a 4th gen Honda City like mine. You can't compare higher budget cars from a higher segment to a lower segment car. My Delhi to Gurgaon daily drives will be a breeze. Over all I'm satisfied with the ride quality, build quality and refinement. I'm looking forward to taking my delivery.", 13th October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,New,68,436

No such complaints in my test drive today of the HyRyder. It could be due to the car being brand new but the AC cooling in general was great. I am very optimistic about the Hybrid technology finally arriving for the masses in India as it could bridge the gap between electrics and NAs/Turbo engines very well.

However due to the launch of the Hyryder, wanted to test drive and consider it as well. Contacted multiple dealers but none of them had TDs and informed that they will let me know. Finally visited Lakozy Toyota in Malad on 08th October 2022 which had test drive available (thanks to my cousin who regularly services his Innova and Fortuner at their service centre). Checked out the car and was impressed with the quality of interior and the head unit. Was quite spacious to sit. I had read the reviews about reduced boot space but when the lower board is removed, it is observed it does has a good amount of boot space. Took the test drive and it took my heart. Also I feel the panoramic sunroof shade should be darker as I could feel the scorching heat. The ventilated seats and AC gave quite a relief. After few days considering the reliability of Toyota and their service, decided to book the Strong Hybrid V Silver model and was told of a waiting period of six months Paid the booking amount and awaiting for further response.

The acceleration and braking are nowhere near the civic, but decent for what the car aims to be. The Hyryder doesn't have much steam left after you hit 80 plus speeds. The car is quite obviously a maruti, the doors feel light, the driver's seat is quite narrow and it does feel built to a cost.

The V Variant of the strong hybrid was the vehicle I test drove. Following Observations has led me to continue my original booking (made on 9th July) 1.) Doors are lightweight and dont THUD, but nevertheless the car handles serverly pot hole ridden roads surprisingly very well. (FEELS SOLID) 2.) I am 5'6"" and a comfortable driving position was obtained almost immediately. ( Unlike the MG ZS Excite which I went to see before coming here ). Driving in the city traffic , overtaking , braking is just splendid. ONLY time you will feel the pain is when - you cross 80 kms/ hr and the engine sounds will be LOUD and CLEAR inside the vehicle. you try and cross 110 and you start realizing the 3 pot and hybrid combination just will not agree to go beyond. 3.)City driveability, visibility, overtaking are absolutely amazing. 4.) Not So Cool Things - Music system is average even in the top end V Variant. Unfortunately have booked the G Variant so need to take my chances. The thin sun roof screen will definitely need to be changed at some point of time, dont think it can take.regular usage wear and tear.

I visited Millenium Toyota, Thane on Saturday & here are few of the lies that I unearthed:We have not started deliveries - There was a delivery for a white colour G Hybrid happening when I reached. After checking with the security guard, he mentioned daily deliveries have been happening since the past week. We have not received allocation of Red / Black Dual Tone or Red colour V Hybrids, except for TD & Display - There were 2 Red / Black V Hybrids in the showroom parking lot itself, waiting for delivery. As per the security guard 2 were delivered already. I had a very heated conversation with the GM, Sales of Millenium Toyota about the dishonesty & the unprofessional overall experience. I still don't have any commitments from them & now in 2 minds to whether continue with them or cancel the booking. Based on their earlier commitments, I have already got a loan sanctioned via them & got valuation done for my old car from Toyota Assist. This also makes me worried if pre sales service is like this, how will the post sales service be?", 17th October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Mumbai,24,43

463, Gurshawn93 , 17:14 ,Newbie,"This is my experience test driving both the mild hybrid model (Suzuki showroom, C.M. Auto, sector 73, Mohali) and the strong hybrid (Toyota showroom, Pioneer Toyota, Ind. Area, Chandigarh). Both were top variants. But before I proceed, I’d like to give a little context to those who are trying to establish whether this car is worth purchasing or not. I was helping a friend of my father's with finding a new petrol, mid-size SUV in the ballpark of Rs. 20L. The following are the other cars we considered and test drove before seeing the Hyryder - Skoda Kushaq / VW Taigun 1.0 AT, VW Taigun 1.5 DSG, Jeep compass 1.4 AT, Kia Seltos 1.4 auto and XUV 700 (no test drive). Long story short - nothing satisfied us and we waited for the Hyryder launch. I will give the details of my experience with these cars after the details of the Hyryder. Fast forward to the day of the test drives. Here are a few general observations for both versions - Cabin Interior: Styling was elegant and build quality quite satisfactory. Dual-tone leather (in top variant) and soft-touch leather on the dash were a welcome aesthetic. The knobs and dials had a relatively sturdy feel to them and I loved the up/down rocker switches on the A/C controls and steering. Ventilated seats worked very well. Most other expected features like wireless charging, 360 degree camera and Apple CarPlay / Android auto were present. Panoramic sunroof was also a one-up as compared to the other cars in the segment that I had test driven. While the design elements and materials were all premium in nature, it would be wrong for me not to say that some things still felt a little plasticky and could be improved upon. Power adjustable seats could have been added in the top variants at least and were missed. The only major complaint I had was that the sunroof shade was flimsy and seemed like it would need replacing soon. Exterior: Good road presence and decent proportions. Top variant of the Hyryder had good looking alloy wheels. Heavier doors as compared to standard Maruti Suzuki a few years back but not as sturdy as VW makes them even today. I’d say choosing between the exteriors of the Grand Vitara and Hyryder will be a matter of personal preference. Nothing seemed lacking in either and both made their own good impressions. Ride & Comfort: The suspension felt well set up and soaked up bumps well. Comparable to Taigun 1.5 (if not better) and second to the Compass. There was a hint of stiffness, but I assume that would be welcome at higher speeds. The seats held you well in place. However, I’m not sure if they would be comfortable for people who have broad torsos. A/C functioned quite well even when the petrol engine was not running. As with other hyrbids, they have used an electric compressor which is not driven off the engine belt. Decent legroom all around. However, in the driver seat, my left leg was resting on the console, but was not uncomfortable and I quickly got used to it. Noise: The 4-cylinder engine of the mild hybrid was very refined and could barely hear it at idle. The 3-cylinder engine of the strong hybrid has a rumble to it when revved. It is undoubtedly louder than the competition. However, it is not unpleasant. The typical EV whine sound is also there when the petrol engine is not active. The mild hybrid is definitely the quieter driving car. Steering & Handling: Good steering feel - not soft like most Japanese and Korean cars typically have. It's adequately responsive and I didn't feel much difference after switching to this from my Skoda Yeti. Overall, very close to the feel of German / American cars. Somehow, the Toyota strong hybrid variant seemed like it handled better on the road and inspired better confidence. It could be the weight of the bigger battery pack at the rear I assume. I did not feel out of place driving the car and its handling did not seem to be lacking. However, I did not get to test it above 80 km/h. Power & Transmission: The mild hybrid AT felt severely underpowered coming from a 2.0 TDI and when you stepped on the gas, the engine revved high till the power was transferrable from the torque converter to the wheels. I am guilty of being an enthusiastic driver and I did not enjoy driving this very much. It will be much more suitable for sedate city driving. The strong hybrid thankfully was remarkably different. 60 km/h came quick and effortlessly and even till 80, it was quite acceptable. I have a feeling that beyond 80 it loses a bit of pep, however. The transmission in the Strong hybrid left a very good impression on me. It was very responsive and seamless unlike the regular automatic on the mild hybrid. Even the engine start and stop did not cause any noticeable change apart from its sound. The technology used says an eCVT and after a little research I found out that it does not function using a steel belt like other CVTs. It is, in fact, continuously variable owing to an interplay of a planetary gear and a motor/generator. I believe this particular transmission has two of these motor generators. Here is a link if you’d like to learn more about how it functions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O61WihMRdjM The Verdict: My overall verdict is that the Hyryder does everything quite well except power in the mild hybrid. There is a marginally better alternative for each category in the market, but no other does all these things together as well as returning as good mileage. One must definitely take a look at this car if looking for a mid-sized SUV and especially if fuel economy is a deciding criterion. While I had originally gone to help out my father's friend, I and my father dropped by the next day and booked a dual-tone, cafe white, strong hybrid V variant for ourselves to replace our ageing Yeti as a daily driver. It’s funny how fate works sometimes. For those who are interested, the following is why we were not pleased with the other cars we saw: Skoda Kushaq / VW Taigun 1.0 AT - Screeching brake noise at low speeds. Drastically compromised interior build quality, poor resale value. VW Taigun 1.5 DSG - Although performance and ride were great, and the DSG was a pleasure to use, we were hesitant because of the higher cost, most likely higher depreciation and the absence of certain features and poor resale value. Jeep compass 1.4 AT - Most luxurious, premium feeling interior and superior ride quality to all the mentioned cars. 1.4 petrol was refined but slightly underpowered and the price was prohibitive. There was also the question of reliability and resale value. Kia Seltos - Good exterior and interior. However, very stiff ride, extremely poor steering feel, long delivery times and previous nightmares with Hyundai quality left a bad taste. XUV 700 - Poor interiors (too much plastic everywhere), prohibitive price and size. Mahindra customer service has also been repeatedly disappointing at Raj vehicles Mohali. Thank you for reading.

464, rahulcmoulee , 20:45 ,BHPian,"Managed to test drive the Strong Hybrid V Variant at Ravindu Toyota Bellandur today. Went at a bad time as there were many people waiting for TD. The Hybrid battery was almost out when my turn came and I think that had an impact on my experience. Here is my opinion on the driving experience: The Pros: 1.) Excellent Air-Con System: This was evident from the moment I stepped in the vehicle. The cabin was chilly and the ventilated seats made the experience complete. Granted it wasn't particularly hot outside with an indicated temperature of 27 degree celsius. I was worried that the thin sunroof cover would let in too much heat, but the Air Con system more than made up for it. 2.) Superb Efficiency: I reset the trip on the MID before setting off. Battery was at 1 bar when I took over, so the engine was running for about 85% of the drive. There were some stretches with stop-go traffic as well. Drove the car in all 3 modes and even managed to reach 90kph on an open stretch. The displayed efficiency at the end was 19.8kpl which was impressive and I'm sure would've been even higher if the battery had more charge. 3.) Well Judged Suspension: The suspension setup struck a good balance between high speed stability and low speed comfort. It absorbed potholes very well and didn't make any noise. Remained composed at speeds of 80-90kph with no obvious vertical movements. 4.) Brisk Performance at City Speeds: Acceleration off the line is very sprightly and the car gains speed pretty quickly until about 60kph. The Power mode really sharpens responses and the car felt eager to accelerate. Normal mode is more than adequate for city commutes. Eco mode is not recommended unless you are in stop-go traffic. Quick overtakes in the city aren't a hassle and are quite easy. The Cons: 1.) Unrefined Drivetrain: This is one of the places where having the battery out of charge made life worse. The 3 cylinder engine was on for most of the journey and it is not a refined unit. More than the noise, it is the vibrations that make it unpleasant. The engine remained on and was even revving slightly to charge the batteries even when I was at a standstill at a signal. This sent vibrations through the steering wheel and pedals. 2.) Lack of Power at Highway Speeds: The engine runs out of steam post 80kph. No matter what mode you are in. Overtakes will need planning and you will need to mash the throttle to get them done. It can cruise comfortably at 80-90kph but it doesn't like being driven enthusiastically. 3.) Lack of Headroom even for the Front Seats: When I sat in the display vehicle in the showroom during my previous visit, the drivers seat was set to the lowest position and I didn't change it as there were many people waiting in and around the car and I didn't have time to get into a comfortable driving position. Today in the TD vehicle, when I got into a position that was comfortable for me, I was surprised to see my head touching the roof. I had to lower the seat and slightly compromise on my view out. Conclusion: The Hyryder is a typical Maruti Suzuki attempt at cracking the Midsize SUV segment. It is designed to please the masses with low running costs and peace of mind. But in their pursuit for outright efficiency, they have made a few compromises too many for my liking. The lack of space both in the cabin and in the boot is too hard to look past in this segment. This will make for an excellent second car for city running with its efficiency and comfortable ride. For me personally, at 24L OTR it doesn't make sense as we are looking for a replacement for our Ecosport which is the only car in our garage. Have cancelled my booking and will be looking at other alternatives.

Well summarised, 24L OTR(Bangalore is costly!!) is definitely not the price for masses. For this price, people will have expectations. I haven't yet taken any TD, but even the Diesels offered by Koreans appear more silent and refined compared to what you are saying. I actually lost interest because of the price and performance mismatch. This car only suits a urban user with city only use case. For someone like me who wants a highway car, this will not fit the bill.

So can we conclude that the HyRyder / Grand Vitara beat the Hyundai/KIA diesel cars on the NHV? I’ve driven the hybrid a fair bit. As far as NVH goes, as long as you are in typical bumper to bumper city traffic and the electric motor is doing most of the heavy lifting, things as good . I didn’t find the engine firing up for charging the battery at low rpm to be intrusive either. But. And this is a HUGE but. As soon as speeds pick up and you need to maintain 60+ speeds, the engine has to provide propulsion continuously. Here, it is totally caught out. It gets loud, boomy and is generally unpleasant. Overall noise at 60+ speeds or under quick acceleration is a little worse than even the diesel Honda City, a car which has the crudest and most unrefined diesel engine there is. Additionally, the insulation level of the cabin is typical budget Maruti spec. You hear plenty of the din from outside even with the windows rolled up.

Petrol engine in City hybrid is proper 4 pot and more fuel efficient like K15 engine of Suzuki. But the hybrid petrol here is a 3 pot one and not as efficient as former.

Diesels took so much market share from the Petrol and that too, so rapidly, between 2010 and 2016 or so - due to the increased fuel economy. The average car buyer won’t mind shelling out a few lakhs more upfront but the “Kitna deta hai” question is paramount and often asked even before the question of what the car costs upfront. It comes from deeply in-born beliefs of 1900s India that our grandparents (and in some cases parents as well) that assets like cars have to used over very long periods of time until they give up, and so, lower running costs are more important, even if one has to pay a bit of premium upfront. The Toyota/Maruti combine knows this very well, as they were milking the Diesel segment the most during the heydays of the early 2010s. Quote: Originally Posted by RaghavEvoX [/list]. 1.

Figured as it was a holiday, the roads might let me ""open"" the engine a little more. I was wrong. Even at 9:30 am on Diwali, I was lucky to find just 1 stretch where I could hit 60. Funnily enough, this is the same route I take daily and it tends to be quite free. Anyways, coming to the test drive. As soon as I got into the V variant, I noticed the cabin was warmer than usual. The SA drove to my residence and had the AC on the whole time but I assumed this could be because of the sunroof and the ""mosquito net"" it comes with. This was quite disappointing as it wasn't a hot day but with it to feel so warm now, I'd hate to imagine what the summers would feel like. I also like to drive with the AC off and windows down, so this was quite a let down. I managed to take it on some interior roads and also on the main road and was quite satisfied with how it still had a smooth drive (like it did the first time). The EV was spectacularly quiet and even with the AC & sound system off, I could not tell that it had switched to ICE. On the one ""open"" stretch I found, flooring it hard to get to 60 did get a little noisy but nothing which I hadn't heard before in my Ecosport or my CVT City. I ended up driving 6 kms this time and managed to get 22.7 km/l (as opposed to 3 km at 23.4 km/l the last time). There were only 2 bars of battery the whole time, so there were switches to ICE quite often. Overall, I was still pleased with the ride quality but not too happy with the cabin temperature. I have downgraded from G to S variant due to this and will have to do without the sunroof (something my kids were not happy with). Is this just me or did anyone else have the same experience with a warm cabin? Would like to hear what others think of any alternatives to the ""mosquito net"".

509, Samba , 00:29 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Hyryder AWD from a Duster AWD owner's perspective. The Duster AWD is a thing of the the past now. Though the Compass AWD will be the perfect upgrade or replacement of the Duster AWD, we can't be sure of the future of diesel cars in India. Similarly, though diesel, the ScorpioN 4x4 is a very good alternative too, but unless Mahindra rectifies the DPF issues at high altitude reliability can be a question. So what remains is the Vitara/Hyryder AWD, the petrol Thar or the to-be-launched Jimny. The Thar is of a different league & it's more suitable for two people than four. So unless the Jimny is launched, I decided to test drive the Hyryder AWD. A small comparison with the Duster AWD- The positives of the Hyryder AWD- A smooth petrol. Good NVH. Interiors are leagues ahead of the Duster. Feature loaded. The AWD electronics work well. Toyota/Maruti reliability. More service centers. Will be cheaper to maintain. The ride and handling, though not in the league of Duster, it's good. The steering is light but gives decent feedback. The handling is good. The ride felt a bit on the stiffer side. The not-so-good part- Outright performance is lacking, but if worked on gears, the car can go fast. I took the car to an under-construction, closed road. There, in the 4th gear it goes to higher speed without any fuss. Overtaking on single lane highways will need proper downshift. With 137 NM torque, the grunt of an effortless off-roader is missed. This car needs to be revved out from a tricky situation. Hyryder will be good on snow/slush. Rocky inclines need to be taken with proper planning. The ground clearance is just okay. Hyryder AWD will suffice the amount of off-roading required during a road-trip to an off-beat location on the hills, but this car is not meant to be taken for the OTRs. In the video below, the obstacle was crossed with the ESP on & 4wd lock. The Duster AWD can cross this at a slower pace due to it's short gearing and better low-end torque. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stpvWDdTTeg With my Etios. ScorpioN 4x4 from Hyryder AWD! Articulation is comparable to the Duster AWD. Both, being monocoque, this is limited. The underbelly is well-protected. Unless one is not too careless, there is nothing vulnerably placed in the underbelly. The silencer placement looks fine in the AWD version compared to the 2wd version. The approach angle, departure angle and the break-over angle is just okay for mild offroading. Though am not a fan of sun roof, but loved the panoramic sunroof of this car. The dashboard looks good. A tried and tested engine. Air-Intake pipe is positioned at a good height. So during rains water wading won't be an issue. Grass and mud stuck after a mild off-road session. The radiator is placed in a secure position. Even if the approach angle fails and the skid plate takes a minor hit, the radiator should be safe. The AWD buttons. Handrest placement is fine, though would have liked it to be a bit longer. Headlights off. Low beam. High beam. The spread of the head light looks decent. Overall it's a good package. I would have liked it to be priced a couple of lacks cheaper than what it is now. The AWD costs 19.22L on-road in Kolkata. Something around 17-18L on-road would have been more VFM. It's a decent package. The overall build quality come across as satisfactory. One must remember that this a well put together Japanese car, & not a German car! Overall I will rate 7/10.

515, RRU , 15:01 ,BHPian,"Wishing you all a very Happy Diwali! After having test driven (review link: https://www.team-bhp.com/news/toyota...rs-perspective) the Toyota Urban Cruiser (UC) Hyryder Strong Hybrid with overall exhilarating experience save the higher NVH, compromised middle seat of second row and boot space, I was waiting for a ride of either Maruti’s (MSIL) Grand Vitara (GV) Smart Hybrid (or Toyota’s NeoDrive). This Sunday (Oct. 23, ’22) got a chance to drive the SmartHybrid version of GV – courtesy Varun Nexa, Hebbal, Bangalore. Honestly, with so many reviews and feedback out in the open about the blunted performance of K15C series engine tuned solely for mileage, my expectation was very low from the planned test drive, but just wanted to rule it out and also have a feel of GV as my focus since unveiling of this hybrid in July 2022 has been the Toyota version (love the badge). Just to give the background – started hunting for a replacement of my near 9-year-old Etios petrol 1.5 NA (~50K on odo and can carry on for another 2 years if nothing suits me – no complaints other than NVH) in July 2022 and have test driven Ertiga, XL6, Carens, Seltos, XUV700 and Brezza (all 2022 facelifted/new versions in petrol/hybrid) – extensively and multiple times. Don’t want to get into the details of each but suffice is to say that the MSIL pack with K15C series engine definitely lacked grunt even though it is an extremely refined, reliable and efficient engine and buyer of any of these will not complain. The characteristically different Kia sisters are a fun to drive vehicles – their sales numbers speak that. I wish Kia (and MSIL as well) were smart enough to make the structure of their cars robust enough to earn better NCAP ratings than they actually earned for the Indian versions. No pun intended, but I find myself at my wits end to fathom why would I crave for features that are of secondary importance to a car while giving short shrift to the important aspect – “safety.” XUV700 is an absolute beast when it comes to performance and road presence – the length of the TeamBHP thread is a testimony of its craze and popularity. That being said, while the mStallion 2.0L turbo petrol engine could be a beast, the engineering/mechanics of the vehicle left me wanting during my test drives. Since I am specifically interested in MT (over AT) given my new car will be the last one before being replaced by an appliance-like EV or some AT ICE-hybrid (with no availability of MT) and want to keep my mechanical connect with car while driving even if that means straining my left leg a bit (in Bangalore’s crazy traffic), I really want a car with absolutely no complaints whatsoever on clutch, engine, gearbox, brake, etc. and mileage too – happy to compromise on sunroof and iPhone/ MacBook/iPad kind of features in a car. I found the MT petrol version of XUV700 (in 3 test rides, cumulatively driving over 50 kms) quite compromised with notchy gear lever that vibrates, extremely long, vibrating clutch play and not-so-inspiring brake. The tractability of gear is also not good. Part of the problem could be attributable to the turbo nature of the engine, but I did not feel anything like that when I test drove the Carens 1.4 turbo petrol MT – it was butter smooth. Now futuristic features, such as ADAS, lane assist, ACC and so on are fine, but you need to get your basics right. Nonetheless, moving on to the subject car GV SmartHybrid, with limited hope I drove the car a good 21 kms with a mix of bumpy service and city roads, as well as highway (NH44). Much to my pleasant surprise, the ride was not only comfortable absorbing all potholes, speed breakers with aplomb but also fun. It was nowhere felt underpowered, and I easily cruised up to 110-115 kmph while climbing and driving on the elevated expressway to Bangalore international airport. This was achieved without pushing the vehicle hard – I did not push further as I got a sense that I can easily cross 140 kmph, but that was not the objective. This experience was contrary to what I read so far and actually experienced with XL6, Brezza and Ertiga. Just to make sure I got it right and it was not a magic or talisman, on my return, it tried again, and it did not disappoint on performance. All through this TD, the engine was quiet, no NVH and the ride was extremely sorted. Now, I was not sure if this was just a perception or actually the performance was good. I immediately did another TD of XL6 MT on the same road and in same conditions. This ride was disappointing – on the same stretch XL6 struggled to reach/cross past 80 kmph and NVH level was higher. These are cars of two different segment, but I am comparing just the performance given both have the same k 15C series engine. Why my experience with the performance of GV SmartHybrid (and impliedly Toyota Neodrive as well) is contrary to the consensus here and my other TDs of vehicles with same engine is quite inscrutable to me, but I am not complaining and quite happy with the TD – seriously considering – perhaps Toyota Neodrive – but will do a TD of that version before concluding. Yesterday (Oct. 25, ’22), got a chance to do TD of the new Kia Seltos 1.5 petrol NA MT and Carens 1.5 diesel MT just to get a sense of how the Carens in 1.5 petrol MT would feel (not strictly comparable other than the engine of Seltos and Carens) given that no TD vehicle of this version is made available by Kia for Carens (really bad on Kia’s part). A brief about the Seltos TD – quite an impressive machine and there was nothing really to not like. Comfortable ride, refined engine with smooth gearbox and clutch, features loaded up to brim in higher variants, new version has standard 6 airbags with other safety features, strong road presence and so on… Since, GV SmartHybrid/Toyota Neodrive (yet to drive this one) and Kia Seltos are the closest comparable that I drove on the same stretch and under same conditions, here is a brief comparison of ride and performance from a driver’s perspective. Looks, features and other aspects are not covered much. 1) Overall ride quality: Both are good, but GV scores better due to more sorted suspension, lower NVH level and the ability to handle bumpy roads and potholes was superior in GV. 2) Performance: Both are very good and will not give you any reason for complaint in either city or highways, but Seltos has an edge – not because I tested it to higher limits – pushed it to 150 kmph for a while and was pretty planted and there was no nervousness – used this opportunity to test braking – 120 to still – worked as expected. It is just that I feel GV will do better in B2B Bangalore city traffic with smart hybrid technology while Seltos will do better in highways – but combined both, I would give a little higher score to Seltos on performance. 3) Steering feedback, dirver’s position, view and comfort: Again, neither gives any reason to complain. GV’s steering was slightly more responsive though. 4) Mechanicals: Both the SUVs have very tractable gear – on 5th gear both the cars were able to run at a crawling speed of 20 kmph without any problem and pulled easily to higher speed. The gear shifts are butter smooth and clutches were soft – you will not miss AT. I, however, found the Seltos’ better. Braking was acceptable in both. Also, with Seltos having 6 gears, cruising around 120 will likely be more relaxed – I noticed both the SUVs were revving at ~2500 RPM at >100 kmph speed. However, not have the sixth gear in GV is not a biggie - MSIL is smart enough to keep the ratio and range optimized. Even Crysta has just 5 gears in MT. 5) Mileage – As I always do, I set the trip meter to 0 before both the TDs. GV SmartHybrid returned a mileage of 18.5 km/l while Seltos returned 15.9 km/l. GV trip covered 21 kms while Seltos trip was 13 kms. A point worth highlighting here – when I stopped in traffic signal twice during the TDs, the GV MID displayed that engine idling is unavailable. If the 18.5 km/l is without the 12v battery supported engine idling then it is indeed an impressive mileage. If I wanted, I could have easily eked out an additional 2 km/l mileage from both the SUVs but was testing multiple things and mileage was just one criterion. 6) Sore Points: One sore point in GV is the middle seat in second row due to floor hump and rear AC console obstructing the leg room – not sure how to manage this. Besides this, I personally don’t think anything else will be a deal breaker for most of the buyers who are considering this car as a serious option. In Seltos, I did not get time to understand the second row and other aspects of seating, features, but prima facie did not find anything that I would call a deal breaker. Headroom in both the cars was adequate with Seltos’ design making better optimization of space even in sunroof enabled version. Legroom (excluding the rear seat middle passenger) in GV/Toyota is more when compared with Seltos. In GV – SmartHybrid – I think the MT gives better punch compared to AT as the machine is programmed more for mileage than for performance, thereby upshifting earlier than required and blunting performance. In MT, I noticed the MID was always pointing me to upshift earlier than I usually do based on my experience and driving style. Guessing, in AT – you don’t get that freedom if you are in D mode��. Moving to manual mode or using paddle shifters frequently to supersede the inbuilt programming then defeats the purpose of having an AT. To conclude – both the SUVs offer great value with styling, comfort and safety. Lower variants in GV/Toyota (Sigma, Delta, E, S) offer better VFM quotient while mid and higher variants of Seltos continue to command edge. With Seltos adding more safety features as standard across variants, its safety rating can only improve from previously 3* while GV/Hyryder is expected to get at least 4*. Between the strong hybrid/intelligent hybrid and Neodrive/smart hybrid - I would prefer the latter as my annual run will not be more than 10k kms and will trade off better NVH, headroom, boot space and simpler and more refined engine with a little better mileage - say 16 km/l vs 23 km/l. In my case, split between city and highway ride will be 80/20. Thanks to Varun of Varun NEXA, Hebbal and Ravi of Epitome KIA, Yelahanka – Bangalore, for helping me with all my probing questions and organizing long test rides. Disclaimer: My reference to and opinion on “performance” of subject car (s) are based on and relative to my experience of driving certain vehicles extensively – Etios 1.5 petrol NA, MSIL Dzire 1.2 petrol NA, Honda City 1.5 petrol NA, MSIL Alto 800, etc., as well as the test drives of aforementioned vehicles done in the recent past. Of course, I was not interested in 0 to 100 kmph in x.xx secs and similar statistics as it would be puerile on my part to look for these in an NA petrol engine.", 26th October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,39,85
516, smilingakash , 15:28 ,BHPian,"Did a quick test drive at Uttam Toyota Patparganj. They are not allowing a highway test drive yet and the internal roads in the industrial area do not allow for speeds>70. I drove with 5 adults on board. Coming from Duster (85PS Diesel), NVH on intentional revving was not a concern. Initial pickup was surprisingly refreshing I hope to find out how well it does on an incline. Car is eager to push even on Eco mode. For your city overtakes, traffic signal dash, the car will bring a smile to your face. Commanding road presence, good view and suspension. Even rear occupants were happy with the suspension (Intentionally breezed past some undulated pot filled roads). On the other hand, Rear seat for shorter runs is fine, for longer runs better plan for 4 adults only (at max 4 adults and a child). Will do a longer test drive when available but initial impression works for my use case. Headroom for rear occupants was manageable. Boot is not a major concern either.

522, arjab , 20:38 ,Senior - BHPian," Quote: Originally Posted by Samba Hyryder AWD from a Duster AWD owner's perspective. Incisive, concise, to the point and most insightful driving impression. I echo your thoughts on the on the bottom end torque delivery of the Hyryder/Grand Vitara twins. A week back i had the opportunity to drive one Grand Vitara, with my friend in Chennai, indulged in some mild off roading and had to give healthy throttle inputs to keep the vehicle moving over broken terrain. In reality, the 137Nm, (on paper), torque loses another 10-14Nm due to drivetrain losses. Thus, with 120-125Nm wheel torque pulling a - what - 1.2 ton(??) car the results would be tepid to say the least. Suzuki / Toyota could have made amends by making the 1st gear very short, like your AWD Duster. This would have masked the torque deficit a great deal. The Suzuki-Toyota just doesn't have that effortlessness which your Duster has at crawling speeds in 4x4 lock mode. Yes, the saving grace is the naturally aspirated petrol engine is very smooth and one doesn't have to worry about turbo lag etc. At high speeds i feel the Duster, particularly, the first lot Duster's, circa 2013, are far superior to the Suzuki-Toyota twins. Yes the Japanese twins have an absorbent ride w.r.t. bump absorption but in rebound control it still lacks finesse. On a fast left hand sweeper, I hit a mid corner dip followed by a broken patch, and the Grand Vitara got very jittery! There were two of us in the car, no luggage and we were at 70-75kmph. The rear hit the bump stops and as the broken patch was immediately after the dip, the tail became skittish too. Nothing alarming; but it was there. I have also driven the Scorpio N courtesy of a good friend of mine at M&M. The powertrain and 4wd traction control system calibration is very well done. The crawl ratio too is thoughtfully worked out. But you need to be very careful with the ScorpioN on serious off roading trails. To my limited observations and whatever mud plodding we did, the departure angle of the ScorpioN is pathetic. In fact it's made worse by the placement of the DEF tank which I'm sure will damage itself, even in mid level off roading, forget hard core off road use. Also one more thing I noticed. Our ScorpioN had stock 18inch wheels & tyres and the rear tyres, the inner tyre wall, under full compression in off road use were brushing the rear wheel arch liner on the inside! This should not be the case at all. Any which way you look at it! It's a basic design fault! Also the ride of the ScorpioN even on smooth highways does'nt feel F-L-A-T and composed like the Duster's. You can always detect some squirming and squiggling. So, coming back to the question which is haunting Samba: can the Suzuki-Toyota replace his French girlfriend? At present I don't think so - in totality. So, what can? In that price bracket? Nothing actually. There are used RR Evoque's available, in Calcutta, around 25odd lakhs but they are too temperamental in the electronics/electrical department for a stress free ownership. Will the upcoming Jimny be better? It may be in terms of tractability as it'll have a low range box, but in terms of ride comfort, agility, stability and handling, I don't know whether it'll be able to ace the Duster. There's a saying in Bengali: ""Nei Mama'r thheke, kaana Mama"" ; (loosely translated ""you are better off with a blind uncle, rather than no uncle"" ) With the current crop of AWD models south of ₹20lakhs available in this country, this adage couldn't be more true!

528, thesilentone , 16:26 ,BHPian,"Was in Bangalore last week and had a chance to test drive the strong hybrid at Nandi Toyota in Whitefield area. It drove pretty well and picked up speed effortlessly. The SA had advised to depress the accelerator smoothly and not press it suddenly to increase speed and performance at city speeds was quite impressive. Since it was not driven in the highway, I don't how it will perform but for normal speeds, I think it should be adequate. Coming from a Hyundai diesel, the NVH was pretty much acceptable and not a deal breaker. My Creta diesel AT has absolutely no creature comforts, so the features present in all the new cars will be a major upgrade . The boot space is definitely less, but could be considered if the major usage is within the city. What is not pleasant however, is the location of the spare wheel. In my Creta, I hate it when I have to check the air in the spare wheel since the bolt has to be removed, the tyre lifted and then the air has to be filled. This is in a totally different league . It is ok for an Innova since it would most probably be chauffer driven and will not affect us but for a self driven vehicle, people may shy away from checking the air in the spare wheel frequently and could be in for a nasty surprise when the time comes for using it.", 27th October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Chennai,266,326

I doubt there would be any takers for the 7 inch system, as all variants above E already come with factory fitted ICE. So the only chance for the dealer to re-sell you 7 inch system, when you upgrade, would be to hope that a customer fo the E variant wants to buy the 7 inch system as an accessory. The E variant is the most barebones one and it is doubtful if many units would be produced by Toyota, as in general, these variants exist only to attract the prospective customers into the showroom with a low starting price point.Even if a customer were to buy a E variant, they have umpteen better options in the open market to buy a Pioneer/Sony or other systems. So my expectation is the dealer will give you little for the 7 inch system the car comes with and will expect you to pay full list price for the 9 inch system.", 28th October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Chennai,"2,220","9,796"

I plan to use a dark coloured V kool film on the sunroof of which hopefully shall solve some of the problem. Transparent sun film on the windshield will be put as well to reduce the glare. The car is well suited for me as I am a sedate driver and 50 pct highway and 50 pct city. My Yaris returns about 5 to 6 kpl in Mumbai city so hopefully this should be about 22 to 23 kpl. I have received an offer of 9.5 Lakhs as exchange for my Yaris. On road Pune is 20.54 lakhs which is a little steep but given the technology its worth it. I have a Nexon EV for my city drives which is a fantastic car but long range drives need to be really planned and will take a couple of years to be comfortable., 29th October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Pune,990,872

548, OpenRoads , 11:38 ,BHPian,"Yesterday I took a long test drive (~ 20KMs) of the Hyryder out of sheer boredom from waiting for the actual delivery. Or maybe this is my way of getting back to the dealers. If they cannot deliver on time I still get to drive the car.. Since it was a long test drive I noticed few more things which I wanted to check with others who have already driven this vehicle. 1. Rear seat space - I took my family ( father, mother, wife and daughter) with me for the test drive. SA from Toyota sat in the front passenger seat while I requested my family to sit in the back. Now none of us are heavy built or above 5'10"". They all were able to fit in the backseat. I get that since its family they have adjusted but still there were 3 adults and a kid. So my point was the backseat is not what people are saying in various forums or reviews. It is totally subjective to your family/friends built and height. If you are someone who is 6 feet + and have similar folks then I see the point otherwise it is good enough space. 2. Sunroof Sunblind - I was complaining about the sunroof blind throughout my discussions in this forum however during my drive yesterday afternoon 12:30PM (sunny) for almost an hour I didn't feel the heat as I thought it will. So my intial perception about as the heating due to thin blind might be wrong. However I still feel its very thin and might need replacing due to wear and tear in long run. 3. Suspension - Now this car was loaded / packed with 5 adults and one kid. On normal roads the ride was pleasant however there were considerable amount stiffness on potholes and bumper. Felt like the suspension bottomed out in one of the potholes. I drove the same way I drive my i10 and there is definitely less noise there. 4. Engine sound - NVH was higher than a 1.2l 4 pot engine however not something which bothered me. It was ok. However the sound insulation is not good or at par with Hyundai. I can hear the noise from the cars passing by more here. 5. Performance - Again this is subjective to what you usually drive. For me its 80bhp to 115bhp. So its good. But for someone who has driven better/bigger engine this will not be something desirable. I was able to drive easily in the city traffic and do overtake easily. I took it to 100 on an empty stretch as well and didn't see any issues.", 30th October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,KOLKATA,177,425

550, karan561 , 17:11 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"My Toyota Hyryder Delivery Video; https://youtu.be/bSVHVVPTt8U ^ Join me in this video to experience the Collection Day excitement of my Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder ""V"" Hybrid in Monotone Cafe White shade. The Video captures, Collection Day Excitement; Quick Walkaround; Some Cinematic Scenes; & Early driving impressions; Buy Decision; This car was booked on Day 1 when the booking started back in July. Since then i haven't checked one out in the showroom nor Test Driven one. In fact the first time I saw/experienced the Hyryder was on delivery day last week. Special thanks & credit goes to TEAM-BHP's Official Review which helped me go ahead with this choice without having the need to go check her out physically or requiring a Test Drive post booking. Dealership Experience; The Dealership selected was Rathod Toyota, Vapi. This is the same dealership where I picked up my last Toyota Fortuner from back in 2016. Rathod Toyota personnel and SA were in touch with me since booking & giving constant updates (whenever they had information) on the status of my booking as well as production updates. I thank them for their professionalism & overall approach right from my booking to delivery which happened during Diwali Holidays (26/10/22). I picked the Extended warranty as well as Insurance from the dealership. Among the freebies I got a set of OE 3D mats & Mudflaps installed at the dealership. ^ The registration no. picked was 1490 on 2 fronts; 1) My Ford Figo (which this car replaces) also had the same no. i.e. 1490 hence there's a sort of a continuity. 2) The 1.5L Toyota engine for the Hybrid models has an exact displacement of 1490 cc. Hence it all fell into place Hybrid Driving Experience; Having not test driven the Hyryder before I was really excited to drive back home. The car starts in EV mode and if a light throttle is maintained it continues to remain an EV. The transition is seamless when driving and is not felt at all, very impressive indeed. However when idling for long (With A/C on) the engine fires back on in a couple of minutes and that transition is felt. The Power delivery in combined form is enough for the city and also highways for cruising at good speeds. Refinement levels are good enough for a 3 cyl, the battery / motor whine is audible if you hear carefully in EV mode, the engine sound is also pretty much there in a good way when you're in a rush sort of helps because there's no tachometer. Fuel economy achieved after about 160 odd kms of driving on day 1 was 23.7 km/l. Some may argue this can be achieved on a efficient Diesel or a Petrol N/A variant / version of the Hyryder/GV too with careful efficient driving, late braking techniques etc. however let me say that to achieve 23+ km/l i did not really make much of an effort to be efficient & thats where the Hybrid tech excels. The e-CVT is also very smooth and feels very soothing to drive. The relaxed manner of this engine - gearbox combo is definitely a USP for the car. Handling / Ride Quality; During the PDI the dealership was smart enough to reduce the tyre pressure to normal levels (@ 33psi v/s 40+ psi kept during transit / logistics). Ride quality felt good (better than the Seltos & Kushaq i own from the same segment) & build too when driving over bad roads / undulations felt robust. The Handling is a pleasant surprise as its fairly engaging and enjoyable. The Steering wheel in my opinion is a bit too thin for my hands but feels good to operate in all conditions. Debadging; The next day got the car debadged; ^ Bye Bye Urban Cruiser; Hello Hyryder; A Mod recommended for all future Hyryder owners Miscellaneous Observations; - ​HUD provides a lot of information. Have read a lot of negative impression about the HUD. Being using a HUD since 2012 in one of my BMW's I really dont mind having this tech now being available at this price point, good effort. - I Picked the Monotone over the dual tone as it makes the Hyryder look taller and more SUV'ish at the same time highlights the fact that it has a Pano-Sunroof very well. - Cafe White Paint shade is somewhere between the typical Toyota Super & Pearl White shades, I like it. - TPMS​ is showing in KPa, still haven't been able to figure out how to switch to Psi. - Infotainment & touch screen is very smooth & feels modern enough. - Car Keys are really sleek, modern and good looking. - Lock / Unlock beep sound is a bit early 2000'ish. - A/C Controls are fun to toggle. - Robust Build in most areas. - Camera Quality is average. - Powered Seats are missed.", 30th October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Mumbai,"5,062","22,130"

The initial quote I received from the dealership was aprox INR 64k, but then they reworked the quote to INR 57k. The quote became less due to some discount provided by them & also because I told them to remove tyre cover, especially when its a 215/60 setup, which IMO was unnecessary.

Are you sure it was the AC compressor because unlike ICE cars the compressor is fully electric so its not ""engaged"" via a clutch pulley set.

Thats because you were in power mode which has a different throttle mapping meaning engine would come on even at slightest application of throttle. In case of my RX450h the ecu also provides the full 650v from the battery, its otherwise restricted to 500v in ECO and Normal mode. Not sure if thats the case with Toyota as well.

The only thing was , I hadnt seen the car in person yet as it arrived only couple of days earlier and I was away on personal work. The following week I returned to Bangalore and visited the showroom. Below were my observations Negatives: 1. Doors are light and feels cheap (this was a total shocker to me. I was expecting if not same at least similar to the new Baleno). Destroyed my confidence completely 2. The boot is indeed really small 3. The interiors finish is poor 4. Turning Radius is 5.3mts (their German competition have 5.05mts) 5. Really thin internal cover for the Panoramic sunroof Positives: 1. The fuel efficient 1.5 TGNA Hybrid engine 2. Comfortable driving position (Im a six foot medium built guy) and rear seats 3. Good looking presence Hybrid cars definitely make sense today if youre driving a good number of kilometres daily in the city.

565, kadanaJ , 14:00 ,BHPian,"Went to the Toyota showroom to check out the strong-hybrid variant of the Hyryder. Took a small test drive as well. My observations over a small city test-drive - The boot is absurdly small for a car of this size - You tend to sit high up. Good visibility out the front. Gives you a 'king of the road' feeling - Acceleration and drivability is super smooth at low urban speeds. If driven sedately, you can barely make out when the engine kicks in. It has an almost EV like response. Brilliant in stop-start or heavy traffic - Under heavy acceleration, the engine does become audible, but not unpleasant. A lot of reviews have complained about poor NVH. I find this subjective, and you should take a test drive to know if it bothers you. Personally, I thought NVH levels were adequate - I couldn't test the car at higher speeds, so keep in mind my points are all based on 0-80 urban driving - Steering felt quick and precise. Much better than budget grade Marutis - The touchscreen unit smooth to respond. Sharp resolution as well - The rear and 360 degree cameras are quite blurry. Usable in the day, but I felt more comfortable relying on the mirrors because of the poor camera quality. I imagine the cameras will be useless at night with the low resolution being offered - Ride quality was okay.

The family agreed on the strong hybrid top model in white + black dual-tone paint. I also recently went for a test drive as the car was available at the Noida showroom. Here are some small observations during HEAVY TRAFFIC. - The engine barely switched on, and when it did under less load, it was not very audible - The Car is really smooth when in EV mode - High driving position, good visibility - I reset the fuel economy to see what I got during this 15 min drive and I got an expected 22+ kmpl - Boot is small, but that's irrelevant for our city commute use case - The car accelerates well enough for our requirements within the city and while this was a concern for me, after the test drive I am happy with what it offers. Yes it will be slow on the highway, but it is not in our use case - I like the HUD and the information it displays Overall I am happy with the car - despite screaming MSIL quality (door panels, door weight, switch gear, and so on) - I will post more updates once I get the car.", 31st October 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,New,73,233

Not funky like the Creta and not too subdued like the VWs. - Driving position, front seats felt quite comfortable. Will need a test drive to confirm. - Build quality was better than I expected. Definitely a step up from my Honda City. - The showroom experience at Lanson Toyota, ECR Chennai was very good. Negatives - - Interior quality is not bad, but certainly not befitting of a 20L plus car. - Rear seat is compromised in terms of both width and headroom. I'm a about 6' tall, and I had just about 2 inches of space above my head. Now, the rear seats do recline a bit and this helps to an extent. - They had a mild hybrid variant and boot was not spacious. The hybrid is going to be lot worse. Overall, I quite liked the package.

601, Audik75 , 22:19 ,BHPian,"My initial ownership review after 2 days of driving the Hyryder. I have been in the market for a car to replace an ageing Wagon-R for over 20 months and considered multiple cars before taking the leap of faith on the Hyryder. I have followed Team-BHP reviews for a while now and found them to be among the most factual and well-written ones after test driving a few cars. My considerations were: 1. Jeep Compass 2021 facelift: liked the Jeep but the steep price of 34L on-road for the S-variant (and an automatic transmission that didnt seem the best mating for the engine) held me back. 2. Tata Harrier: still in love with it. The lack of features (several of which have now crept into it through the multiple launches) that the Nexon / Safari had and the Hydraulic steering with poor calibration held me back. 3. Maruti Brezza: Booked the new Brezza on launch but ended up cancelling as I read reviews about the K15C engine performance. While it did largely meet my use cases at 17.3L, I felt it was overpriced compared to the outgoing version and no longer the value buy. I did not consider the Korean twins (safety perception) or the German ones (multiple issues owners have reported post launch and the compact SUVs appearing more like a large hatchback- no offence to owners). Didnt consider Mahindra given the waiting time for their SUVs albeit I could have planned this given how long I waited to actually buy. With other options largely being ruled out and the inertia post COVID drawing to a close, ended up booking the Hyryder on launch day expecting a pricing around 23L-24L for the V variant given the Honda City bev pricing. The key factors were a car to primarily handle city driving conditions with occasional stints on the highway. The lack of adequate EV charging infrastructure on the highways and constraints at my apartment meant pure EVs were ruled out. I have experienced the Prius nearly 20 years back and was happy to consider a Toyota hybrid. Was eagerly waiting for the Hyryder review and when it launched end of August, felt the car ticked all the boxes I wanted. Two plus months after this, still feel the Team-BHP review is the most comprehensive one and have been following the forum avidly. Sales experience: The sales experience from Toyota was non-existent through July and August and I ended up booking Grand Vitara as a backup. Clearly, Maruti Suzuki has the better sales process and the dealers were more hungry for business. However, starting mid-September, things changed and once the display cars showed up, interest started building up and I got assurance from the Toyota dealer that they would arrange for delivery by October month-end. I received a call mid-October that the car had been allotted and they could arrange delivery around Diwali. I was however stuck with some health issues at home and deferred delivery till early November. Requested the dealer to get Ceramic coating done to avoid an extended waiting period (quote was comparable to the market and also included 3 further coats to be applied at 6/12 month intervals). It was pelting in Chennai when I took delivery last week , did a quick PDI and missed out on checking TPMS which showed blank on reaching home (this has since reset itself and is not an issue). Over the last 2 days have done only city hops and a short ride on a highway that was congested enough to prevent me going over 85kmph. Initial experience: Detailing below some observations from my limited driving experience. 1. The car is really responsive and getting to 65kmph is a breeze. I drive a 2015 Honda City CVT primarily and I should say accelerating on the Hyryder is slightly easier at city speeds. The electric motor assists with low-end torque and no lag is felt. 2. The car goes absolutely silent on start-up and is remarkably silent on EV mode. Didnt feel the car as noisy up to 85kmph (will check on my next highway trip on how the car behaves at speeds above 100) and given 95 percent of my driving is at these speeds, not feeling the impact of the 3-pot engine. 3. There is a clear shudder / vibration that is felt when it switches from electric to ICE at parking. This isnt as obvious while driving albeit you will hear the engine. I was playing around with the infotainment to understand features and change settings hence I experienced this a couple of times and is clearly something that needs improvement. 4. There is a whine that you hear (noted on the Team-BHP review by Vid6639 as originating from the brake vacuum pump which is uncovered). This is noticeable only when you are driving in EV mode in a quiet environment. Not sure if damping even helps in this case and would appreciate feedback. 5. Mileage is clearly going to be above 20kmpl in the city if you go easy on the pedal. Coming from a Honda CVT, this is something I am trained to do. 6. The 360 camera doesnt feel like a total 360 at least in terms of visualisation and only the left side is being shown while driving. While logically this makes sense in right-hand drive cars, this is a feature that can be improved unless I am missing turning something on (enough has already been said on the quality of the images). 7. Wireless Apple CarPlay was a breeze to setup and overall things worked as expected. 8. Air condition (given Chennai weather) and the sunroof was a concern. The AC is however more than satisfactory when set in Auto mode. Ventilated seats are handy albeit at their highest level can be noisy. Lower fan speed appears sufficient. 9. The interior is brightly lit during day time. My son remarked that while he forgets the Honda City has a sunroof, on the Hyryder it is apparent enough. If you are a fan of sunroofs you will like it but given Indian summers, probably best to get a sun film installed. 10. Ambient lighting is hardly noticeable. I do not care much about this but this looks like an attempt to just tick the box on the feature list. 11. Access to the spare tyre is from the boot and requires using a wrench to lower the tyre should you need to replace. 12. Boot space is limited but will fit needs for a small family and weekend trips just fine. Didnt buy a boot mat as it limits usage of the space further. Overall, looks like a decent buy and no buyers remorse yet (too early I guess). Got an extended warranty but expect the much talked Toyota service experience and hassle free maintenance factors to come in handy.", 6th November 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Chennai,44,142

My observationsWe (SA, myself) could not find out whether vehicle is powered on or not without checking the dash. It's super silent when it's idle. Also on slow speeds. It's like driving an EV. It was a mix of city drive with unscientific speed bumps and on the traffic heavy highway Suspension is not bad in the slow speed and if you go slow on speed breakers. Highway 60kmph run was good. If you push it makes noise like typical of how an auto gear is revved which I do not like. On slow speed picking up is good as it's only on battery power I suppose. All brake disc brake has good bite Ergonomics are ok for me. Did not face any issue. Good visibility front and side. 360 Camera is a good value add. Boot is still decent after battery placement. The difference of space lost is not much if you see overall. Good for sedate driving. If you are aggressive, better use sport mode and it's better. Still it's not for enthusiasts and rev hard makes engine noise. Door heaviness, Sheet Metal are of Brezza quality I would say. Not like Baleno.

606, aa_skoda_toyota , 17:23 ,Newbie,"Hello All, This is my first post on the Team-BHP forum, so please excuse if have made some mistakes. I was in the market for a mid size SUV for the past 1 year and and my rationale for rejecting the Korean and German Twins was the same as @Audik75. I didnt consider XUV 700 because of the steep waiting period (1 year for AX7 D auto variant). I got the Hyryder Hybrid G variant about 2 weeks back with about 500 KMs on the ODO and this is my initial review. Startup: As mentioned multiple times in this thread, its super silent. Initial days its a struggle to realize the car has started and we can drive. Got accustomed quickly to the EV mode. Drive: The Hyryder offers superb pickup and overtaking is a breeze. If you're gentle on the pedal the acceleration is smooth with not much noise from the 3 pot engine. Driving in the infamous Bangalore traffic is effortless, just remove the feet from brake pedal and the car crawls at 8kmph. Things are a little different on highways. If taken to cruise speeds (less than 100kmph) with light throttle the car gains speed without much noise. If revved too hard and at high triple digit speeds (greater than 120 kmph) the engine gets quite noisy though. Fuel Efficiency: This is where this car brings a smile everytime you take it out. I've got mileage in the range of 28kmpl to 19kmpl on the ODO for my drive to/from my office 28 kms away. On a highway trip of 200 kms I got 19.5 kmpl on the ODO. When I calculated the FE based on the volume I filled and kms covered, I found it to be around 20.5 kmpl. Build Quality: This is where my heart sinks every time I open the door. Coming from a 2011 Skoda Fabia, the doors feels like they're made of dried leaves, they're so light. The door handles are another sad story . Why Toyota Why?? Why did you have to follow Suzuki in this department? I am really worried if the doors can protect in case of an unfortunate side impact. The hood and the boot are sufficiently heavy, at par with the Germans. I guess Toyota has designed the car keeping NCAP front and rear impact tests, but they forgot about the side impact scenario. I understand its based on the same platform as Brezza which managed NCAP 4 star, so I hope it can score similar, if not more. Interiors: The Koreans offer better interior fit and finish, but I have no qualms here. The seats are super comfortable and long highway drives should not be an issue. These are my observations in the limited time that I have owned this car. I'm planning to take the car on a longer highway trip, I'll post my review on the drive post that.", 8th November 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,2,15

Here is a quick review / some points not covered by others:Driving in EV mode if freakishly silent & smooth. Still not gotten used to it. It has very good road presence. I have got compliments from strangers on the road. Visibility is pretty good from the driving seat, except on the right hand side A pillar. Need to figure out a better seating position. Even though the sunroof cover is thin, it serves the purpose of keeping the heat out. I drove during peak afternoon in Mumbai & faced no issues. You get to see instant mileage based on how you're driving & which mode you are in. If you adjust your driving style based on the display (it is available on both - the instrument cluster & infotaintment screen, you can get really great mileage out of it). Its nice touch of gamification for people who are into it. I have been getting 16 kmpl to even upto 32.7 kmpl (!!) mileage for individual trips. Attaching the picture of the highest mileage I have achieved. It was a city + highway run with bad traffic in between. I had my sleeping baby on board, so was driving unusually sedately. This is based on the display, I haven't yet tried the refuelling method to calculate the mileage. Door build quality is poor & it takes an effort to close the door properly NVH at high speed is not bad. Although, it becomes very apparent when the car is stationery & the engine switches over from battery. It is overall a safe (hopefully 4 star NCAP), practical family car & I don't regret my decision so far.", 8th November 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Mumbai,24,43

Continuing to surprise quite a few people in the parking lot. The transition from EV to ICE and back is seamless in city speeds. Need to keep checking the instrument cluster to see if it's in EV mode or not. The indicated mileage after covering around 370km is 25 kmpl. This is mostly within Bangalore city except a 150km dash on the highway (30.6kmpl on the highway drive). Super impressed. P.S. I'm a sedate driver. The car is very punchy till it reaches 80kmph. Haven't pushed it beyond 100kmph yet, but could feel the strain on the engine post 80kmph. Turn by turn navigation shows up on the digital instrument cluster, IF, Apple maps is used with Apple car play. Google maps on Apple car play doesn't show it. Haven't used Android auto yet, so can't comment on that. Also, navigation as a whole was a quite laggy at times with wireless Apple car play. Using it wired seemed to solve it. Suspension is very well tuned. Takes care of most of the CRATERS on Bangalore roads. Plastic quality on the inside is a bit disappointing. Very scratch friendly. Especially the plastics on the door. Coming to the door, the driver side door won't close easily. Needs a proper SLAM! However, sliding down the windows seems to make it close normally. Will have to get this checked. The other doors seem fine-ish. I didn't have a proper long drive yet, but the seats seem good. I'm over 6'1"" and there's quite a bit of headroom as well. Having no sunroof helps, I guess. I'm no audiophile, but the music system felt adequate to me, even without the tweeters. Quality of reverse parking camera is adequate. The right side A-Pillar is quite thick and there is a proper blind-spot. Some in-car gymnastics is recommended while crossing a busy junction. Overall, I have to say I'm quite happy with the experience so far. Hoping for many a miles with the white beauty.", 10th November 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bengaluru,12,31

630, hummer , 13:44 ,BHPian,"Toyota HYRYDER (Strong Hybrid) test drive feedback from a Renault Duster (Diesel AMT) owner: I was in the market since last few months looking for a suitable replacement for my 2016 Renault Duster (Diesel AMT), though Duster is giving a great service, itch of new car caught up and hence was on the look out. I was delighted when Toyota announced Hybrid SUV for India and made a booking for gaming grey strong hybrid in August and was eagerly waiting for additional details. We know how the teasers, announcement, pre-launch, launch, media drives, price reveal, instalments of information sharing went with HYRYDER. When I am spending this sum, obviously I wanted a better SUV in most of areas compared to my Duster. HYRYDER looked very, competent, handsome inside out in videos and pictures. I went through a lot of youtube reviews where they highlighted concerns on boot space, 3 cylinder engine refinement/noise etc but I didn’t want to cancel my booking until I see and test drive myself. I was hoping HYRYDER will connect with me and somehow felt I can manage with the negative points. Though Ravindu Toyota, Bellandur is on the way to my office, I couldn’t visit for test drive due to mismatch of time and heavy traffic on that stretch. I was pleasantly surprised when I got a call offering test drive at home, I couldn’t be happier, because I wanted my wife and son also to experience the vehicle. Vehicle came at the promised time, I was floored by the exterior beauty when looked at her from the I floor, elegant stance and fresh design too. I test drove with my wife, son along with the SA. We drove a decent distance and below is my feedback mostly comparing to my Duster. What was impressive:Exterior looks are sleek, modern and premium Interiors are leaps ahead of Duster’s bane bone cluster Silent cabin when engine is idling and at lower speeds Overtaking is quick and predictable within city compared to AMT unit of Duster Lots of modern features powered by Hybrid technology, safety and economy My son is 5.10 and didn’t feel any head room issues at the rear Door pockets at front and rear doors to accommodate big water bottles No so impressive:Ride quality on bad roads is not as plush as Duster, suspension is a bit hard 3 pot engine was noisy obviously when driven hard, not for enthusiasts AC fan and ventilated seats are too noisy to my taste Audio is not great in this premium offer (felt loud, not soothing to hear), I felt Duster’s unit is decent Back seat is definitely cramped compared to Duster Duster boot is 475 ltrs against 250 ltrs of HYRYDER As soon as wife sat at back, she said space is less and windows are small Even front seats are a bit narrow and my left knee was hitting the center console Head up display in front of the driver is not very useful Large transmission tunnel hump hinders rear center passenger In spite of being new model, surprisingly it didn’t turn heads Here are some pictures comparing both SUVs in similar angles (It’s not to prove one is better than the other, each has it’s own strengths): View from the first floor: Front cabin (Duster's cabin looks 1980s): Rear seats: Front view: Alloys (Duster has Terrano's alloys): Tyres, headlights, fogs, front grill: Side profile: Rear view (Duster's rear is most boring): Boot space (Duster has the best in the segment): My key reasons to cancel:Boot Space, Boot Space and Boot Space I thought my wife and teenage son would fall for HYRYDER’s interiors, especially for panoramic sunroof, ventilated seats, rear AC etc, but I was pleasantly surprised when both told there is nothing significantly better than Duster to consider it as a worthy replacement and they prefer Duster until the one is found.

Having driven the car for nearly two weeks, I can vouch for the torque at the low end and power delivery is definitely decent till you reach legal speed limits (read as upto 3-digit speeds in kmph). This car offers a combined power output of 115 bhp and power delivery comparisons for cars with a similar power range will show the Hyryder / Grand Vitara as competitive. Anyone opting for this car will have some compromises to make (not unlike any other car) and those are clear as summarised by other Team-BHPians - compromised boot space, rear seating for 3 pax, NVH at high speeds.

655, sukrit7 , 16:55 ,BHPian,"Unfathomable that we bought a car without me driving it, but that is exactly what accompanies a new job and a lot of work travel! Heres what happened, the competition we assessed, and some pointers on what a 150kms with the Hyryder Strong Hybrid V feels like. Back in August, we booked both the Grand Vitara and the Hyryder. We were looking for a car that would replace our immaculately maintained EcoSport Titanium Diesel and my all-time favourite Mitsubishi Cedia (damn you, NGT). The post covid world meant that we could happily downsize and manage with fewer vehicles between two homes although I would really have loved to retain the Cedia purely for its nostalgic value. Anyway. So  the car we would get needed to play a unique role in borrowing characteristics from both vehicles. It had to be reliable, efficient, built to last, fun to drive, and reasonably powerful. It needed to be a car that received a thumbs-up from my parents, my partner, and me. Very different judgement criteria were to apply but two had to hold: My fathers knee insisted on an automatic, and my mothers back refused to live with the trauma-inducing backseat of the EcoSport. The initial reviews I read placed a looming question mark on multiple areas  build quality, interior finesse, and power. I for one was rather dismayed and suggested we look at alternatives. While I could make my peace with other aspects, the supposed lack of power was upsetting. I loved the easy-going nature of the Cedia and its rev-happy attitude! Nonetheless, we checked out the Maruti sister and came away not too impressed. The doors didnt have the heaviness that we were used to from the tank that is the Ecosport, and the interior didnt scream Korean luxury. Wed almost decided against it but opted to wait for a test drive. Two and a half viable alternatives emerged. Of the Korean sisters, we preferred the Seltos and immediately drove to the showroom. The interior quality blew us away. It was a segment or two above the GV and the Hyryder. Id driven the petrol turbo before and had thoroughly enjoyed putting it through its paces. My mother did however find the setup stiff although she said it was better than the EcoSport. The Seltos can sure spoil you. Its a tough car to beat, but one major factor worked against it and that was the abysmal safety rating. Although we slipped often, and almost put it a booking amount, the 3-star safety rating kept holding me back. In 2016, the EcoSport's high safety rating and a variant with six airbags had swayed us towards it, and we didnt want to compromise on this aspect. We found the Kushaq to be extremely comfortable and I loved its mannerisms. The 1.5 DSG is blissfully fun to drive and became a key contender. The in-time five-star rating helped tremendously. The interiors were reasonable, but DSG horror stories and the general perception of Skoda played in my mind. We also flirted with the idea of the 1.0 which would solve one problem at least. I travelled through most of October and early November, and during this time, my family found a chance to take a short drive of the Hyryder and they came home seemingly satisfied. During this period, GRAP guidelines often meant that our cars were grounded forcing us to slightly hustle. Through the time I was away, I watched and read everything that existed on the Hyryder. For a week, I stayed in a hotel next to a Toyota showroom in Bhiwadi. One late evening, I walked into the empty showroom and was greeted by a subtle maroon Hyryder. I spent a good half hour with it and found some flaws fading. The car was feature-rich, and a step up from the loaded EcoSport. I missed rain-sensing wipers but liked the ventilated seats, the sunroof, the comfortable seats, and the general airiness of the cabin. I didnt particularly mind the interiors and I noticed that the AC controls were the most rudimentary in a cabin that was otherwise reasonably well put together. The curtain for the sunscreen is the most obvious flaw. I did not get a chance to drive the car but conveyed my thoughts to my family back home. There was one factor that kept attracting me to the car and it was one that the Kushaq and the Seltos could never compete with. We expected the car to be used for 1.5-2k kms per month and the fuel efficiency was drool-worthy. Some back-of-the-envelope calculations suggested that wed incur a significantly lower overall cost vis-à-vis the Seltos and the Kushaq petrol variants. We wanted the car to serve as a primary and efficiency mattered. The G variant is the greatest value for money and thats the one we wanted to settle for. Our initial booking though was for the V and as luck would have it, a blue V made itself suddenly available. Take it this week, they said. So, the family (sans me) took another long test drive and came away rather satisfied. On the 15th of November, the Hyryder was home. We opted out of most accessories, and I was happy to see no pressure being exerted by the dealership. On the 17th, I finally drove myself home from IGI airport in the blue somewhat blingy Hyryder! Id say that it is one rather good-looking car! Whats to like: First things first, the silent cabin is bloody eerie. On EV mode, all that accompanies you is a slight whine and contrary to many reviews, I found that in general operation, you cant really tell when the engine engages. You can however definitely notice if youre at a standstill and Id agree that NVH could have been better handled in this scenario. Truth be told, I was expecting the car to be an absolute slouch, but Im glad to have been proven wrong. While I havent hit a highway yet, I found progress to 90 very satisfactory. Acceleration is fairly rapid, and you can certainly close gaps extremely quickly. On most occasions, I found that battery and engine power came together to form quite a harmonious union. Having said so, there is a way to drive this car, and that way is not pedal-to-metal. Neither is this car expected to win you a sprint from 0-100. However, if youre pottering around in the city between 20-30-40, youll be hard-pressed to feel that there is any lack of power and on most occasions, the torque should keep you happy. This is an extremely comfortable car to drive. It seems large from the outside but is very nimble and sure-footed. Its relatively quiet nature makes the clatter of the EcoSport feel extremely rudimentary. The auto-box has none of the rubber band effect that Ive felt earlier and works silently in the background. On most occasions, I did not find it hunting for gears. The handling is great, although the EcoSport is probably better. The suspension is downright exceptional and very little filters through, especially at higher speeds! My mothers very happy! The build quality is good in most places, and the car feels well put together, but the doors have none of the weight were familiar with. Somehow though, the ones on our Hyryder shut usually on the first attempt. The energy flow meter means you drive conservatively, and I was able to achieve an astonishing 31kmpl on my drive back from the airport. I will admit that I tried rather hard, but on the days that have followed, I have yet to see it fall below 25. For a car this size, that is somewhat surreal. This car is loaded to the gills. I love the ventilated seats even in the winters, and the sunroof is a fun addition although I dont expect to be able to use it much considering the harshness that is Delhis weather. A wireless charger (for TWS earphones I love but often forget to charge), great headlights, and an adjustable armrest are features I immediately liked. Oodles of space to hold your accessories. The blue-coloured engine start-stop button is funky and appeals to the environmentally conscious human in me. The folks love the rear AC vents. A mixed bag: The audio system is acceptable and cannot match the Seltos. The 360-degree camera helps because the rear headrests prevent a clean view, but I wish Toyota hadnt offered a camera that makes the old Nokia 6600s look good. Obviously, Toyota and Maruti should offer better controls for the HVAC even if they leave the rest of the cabin the way it is. Whats not to like: Toyotas voice assist comes on too often, and I turned it off without the first half hour. The TPMS is still in KPA and Ive found no way of switching it to PSI. That sheer curtain is going to be hell-on-earth in the Delhi summer. Additionally, I wish there was some genuineness to the claim of premium tuned sound, and Id have liked electrically adjustable seats. Ive adjusted to the interior now and I find it somewhat welcoming. I also dont particularly care for the HUD, and Im waiting to see if the boot can manage our luggage. Although the HUD shows you navigation prompts, it sucks that the car doesnt have in-built navigation. Lastly, the location of the drive mode button is ridiculous and fiddling with it while driving is a recipe for disaster.", 19th November 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,delhi,722,185

Congratulations! May you have many many kilometers of joy with the hyryder Also, thanks for this review - I am glad that someone finally matches my observations on the Hyryder because the official reviews everywhere are to the contrary. In my test drive of the strong hybrid I found that its rolling acceleration is very, very good - in fact, probably better than even the XUV 700 Diesel and definitely better than the Kushaq 1L AT (without using kickdown or dropping a gear - both of which I didn't get to try in my normal test drive). I am specifically referring to the rolling acceleration (like 20-60 kmph or 40-80) the stuff that I can actually use for overtaking on a daily basis. I see that the 0-100 kmph vbox figures put it a little slower than both the Magnite Turbo as well as the Kushaq 1L AT and a whole 2s slower than the XUV700 Diesel AT, but the Hyryder strong hybrid clearly felt peppier in my test drive. The flip side of the coin is that in making it peppier it also makes a bit more engine noise (compared to the XUV, Kushaq, Magnite) when pushed for these overtakes. But yes otherwise the car is very silent and I wasn't able to detect the engine turning on/off in regular Bangalore traffic unless I was specifically looking for it. Also, I found the brakes on the Hyryder to be more to my liking in their bite and progression - as compared to the following 1.

Please make sure to comment on fuel efficiency and frequency of fill ups compared to your other cars for your daily driving scenario, ride quality, acceleration and cruising experience between 60-100km/h range, NVH and some specific things you love and hate about the car. Thanks Its been 3 weeks of driving and honestly there isnt much to dislike about the car in terms of how it drives. My comparison is to a Honda City CVT and this car has better pull when starting from a traffic light for instance. The City is more refined at higher speeds but this isnt bad either - have stayed within 95kmph so far and NVH isnt a factor to worry about at these speeds. Have taken a couple of highway rides and I remember being concerned about it when buying but my better half certainly hasnt complained and Ikill take that as validation enough. Is it perfect - NO but there cant be too many complaints if you know how to get the best of a CVT. Cruise control works just fine - no complaints - I prefer the Honda City buttons though (maybe more ergonomic or just me having to adapt after years of using them). On fuel efficiency, my car was handed over with 53 kms on the odometer at 7.8kmpl - have driven ~475 kms and havent hit half-tank yet. Fuel efficiency is at 18.4 kmpl and is still climbing. By this time, I would have had to definitely refuel on the City given most of the driving has been within city limits. I think it is safe to say that fuel efficiency will average above 20 kmpl and even driving without efficiency in mind, one can see ~900 kms before needing to refuel. The suspension is good as is braking. Headlights are also much better on the Hyryder. With the higher seating arrangement, the Hyryder offers better front visibility with the bonnet being fully visible. A feature comparison is probably not appropriate so will stay away from that. Definitely liking the ventilated seats and other creature comforts the Hyryder has to offer. Where the City scores is rear seating for 3 (despite having narrower dimensions) and boot space. Both of these are handicaps for the Hyryder but since I rarely drive with 5 adults and am not a big user of boot space, am fine with these compromises. Boot space for weekend drives on the Hyryder will not be a problem in my opinion with some Indian jugaad (my key factor in not preferring the Honda City hybrid when it launched). Battery level stays primarily at 2 bars and rarely go higher in city driving conditions. On the highway, have seen this go higher. Had to watch a YouTube video to understand this factor doesnt matter and one should only go with fuel efficiency. I will just leave it to my sheer ignorance of driving a Hybrid and not knowing how to measure efficiency. Hope this helps!", 24th November 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Chennai,44,142

686, Strider24 , 12:03 ,BHPian,"I took a test drive of Hyryder Hybrid yesterday at Sonak Toyota Pune. I am doing passive research for my next car upgrade from Corolla Altis and below are my observations: Please note that I have been spoiled by the quality and comfort experienced in Altis & my points are more on a nitpicking side. Car looked good from outside but not so premium sitting inside. there are too many layers on dashboard whereas I prefer simple dash layout, something like Honda City or Skoda Slavia. Visibility is very good though. its big in size but doesn't feel big while driving. Driver seat comfort is okay, under thigh support could have been better. Rear seat is positioned upright, long drives will not be comfortable for rear passengers. a recliner function would have been useful there. Overall material quality is way below the usual Toyota standards. dashboard plastics & sheet metal quality has been downgraded compared to what I see in my current car. For me it was a big let down as I was expecting Toyota would have corrected their mistake with a fresh product. There was a Hilux parked next to it and the in-cabin quality is way higher in it than any of current Toyota offering in sub 50 lakhs segment. Took a short test drive too, apart from the usual experience of driving a Hybrid car what I felt was that it would feel underpowered on a highway drive & every overtaking will need careful planning. After certain RPM ( didn't note it) it looses its steam. something which I am not used to in my current car. I think this was expected by majority & now has been accepted by prospective buyers. Toyota has accepted the Maruti QA standards ever since rebadged Marutis became part of it's product line ups in order to increase sales. In my opinion if someone is Looking for a lateral upgrade to a high quality car in sub 25 lakhs price bracket there are other better options available in market, like MG ZS EV, Honda City Hybrid & XUV700 Diesel ( non top end models which may have less waiting period).

The initial pick up is almost similar to the Nexon EV. Didn't get a chance to drive above 60 kmph, but I was reasonably impressed. The ride was pretty mature and handling was decent. Nothing to complain about. NVH is OK. Starts off eerily quiet on EV model but when the engine does come on there's no mistaking that its a 3 pot. Not too refined. Front seats were quite comforable and headroom was more than adequate. I'm almost 6ft tall. Rear seats have pretty good legroom, but three adults sitting abreast will be a challenge - the cabin is a bit narrow and the transmission tunnel really gets in the way. Rear Headroom is acceptable. Fit and finish is a mixed bag. Plenty of hard plastics not befitting of a 20L plus vehicle. As others have mentioned, it's more Maruti than Toyota.

689, drsachin , 19:08 ,BHPian,"I have few questions from senior BHPians. Although I have booked Hyryder Hybrid, i still have some doubts regarding Automatic thing. I have driven manuals throughout my life but now wants to shift to the ""perfect"" Automatic which is available below 20LAC price. I am aware of all the pros and cons of various types of Automatic transmissions and have taken test drives of various cars but couldn't convince myself for getting any of those. I am a heavy mile muncher within city. It's almost 2000kms per month so fuel efficiency is important for me . May be this eCVT is the best for me. Want to have opinion from other members specially those who have driven lot of Automatics. I took test drive of following automatics since last 1 year XUV700- Torque converter and best when it came to pickup but definitely not for me. Couldn't get a good driving position and fuel guzzler too. MG Astor- Driven Turbo variant and another TC. Great pickup but a little jerky and poor fuel efficiency too. MG Hector- CVT. Low speed driving was good but on a flyover it had the least pickup among all automatics and it's here I got know about what ""rubberband effect"" is all about. Kicks CVT- Huge difference between CVT and manual. A great engine in manual mode was struggling in CVT. Very poor tunning or just bad CVT. Honda City. CVT again and just ok pickup but iam interested in a SUV. Alcazar: TC and definitely better than all the CVT . MID was displaying 12/13 KMPL in the short test drive I took. But i know Hyundai's MIDs usually exaggerate displayed fuel economy so not sure if it's really 12/13 KMPL. Brezza AT- TC but felt sluggish of all the automatics i drove. Carens DCT- Great pickup and definitely close to manual and i think even fuel efficiency is ok but after reading so much about DCT reliability issues i think this one is not for me. Didn't test drive any other Hyundai or kia car for same reason . Many recommended Kushaq and taigun but definitely want to avoid these Germans. Not comfortable with their service centres for various reasons. And finally i drove Hyryder Hybrid. And I had the following observations. Just to let u know i was allowed only city test drive on congested roads only as there were no highway or an an empty road nearby. I took 3 test drives of 5/6 kms on different days. Maximum speed i could achieve wa 60kms/hour. 1. Pickup was definitely better than any of the CVT and almost same as Carens DCT. In fact 0-60kms/hour was probably the best. I have a feeling that since at low speeds the electric motors are very active, the torquey motors have resulted in great pickup. If that is so this might have resulted in CVT transmission without any rubberband effect. I really want automatic enthusiasts to make their opinion on this . Or may be I should take TD on a highway only to get a true feeling. I think CVT rubberband effect spoils driving experience in low speed only. What say? 2. Second thing I want to know is regarding ""Engine braking"". I really use engine braking a lot in my manual car and in Automatic we can use engine braking by using Paddle shifters or manual mode. But in Hyryder both are missing so how to employ engine braking without these. How do people driving electric vehicles employ engine braking when there is no engine. Does not having an engine braking makes it Safety hazard? In Hyryder there is a ""B mode"" which as per salesman is to be used when on downward slopes to slow car speed. Can we use this Bmode for engine braking? Oh just forgot to add that I am interested in petrol only. No diesel as I stay in Delhi NCR", 29th November 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Ghaziabad,134,409

If that is so this might have resulted in CVT transmission without any rubberband effect. I really want automatic enthusiasts to make their opinion on this . Or may be I should take TD on a highway only to get a true feeling. I think CVT rubberband effect spoils driving experience in low speed only. What say? I am not a senior BHPian. I am trying to share my test drive experiences and what I learnt here about e-CVT. There is no belt mechanism here. If you try to search earlier post, there was a reference of YouTube tutorial about this e-CVT. I personally have Scorpio N Diesel 6 speed AT booking intact (cancelled the petrol, bad decision since I am located in NCR). Also test drove Tata Harrier AT, XL6 & Brezza AT, Creta CVT, Kushaq 1.0 AT and all new Grand Vitara and Hyryder e-CVT recently. The test drive in Grand Vitara Hybrid e-CVT drive was about 18 km. This e-CVT was super smooth. The Kushaq 1.0 AT was the best to drive. And 2nd best is this e-CVT hybrid. 3rd was Scorpio N petrol. At present I am in Bangladesh, and we have many Toyota and Honda hybrid cars for our site commutes. They run very smooth on sand surface, though at lower speed only (20-30 kmph max).", 29th November 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Gurgaon,627,"1,972"

Does not having an engine braking makes it Safety hazard? In Hyryder there is a ""B mode"" which as per salesman is to be used when on downward slopes to slow car speed. Can we use this Bmode for engine braking? Oh just forgot to add that I am interested in petrol only. No diesel as I stay in Delhi NCR There is very limited rubberband effect in the Hyryder / Grand Vitara. It's a pretty comfortable car to drive. The B mode replicates the effect of engine braking in that it keeps the car in a lower gear, also charging up the battery. Use it when you're driving down a slope, but not necessarily in the city.

The car is usually between 1-3, and most often at 2 so I guess it is normal. For the first few days, I tried to get it to charge up, but I realised that it probably doesn't matter much. The car stays on EV mode as long as you're light on the throttle, which I admittedly find somewhat difficult to do. A workaround in the city is to keep the car on Eco mode.

708, smilingakash , 16:26 ,BHPian,"Hello All, I finally got the delivery of my Silver Knight Delivery Day The formalities were mostly done during PDI so delivery was a breeze. It took me an hour to reinspect and take a demo from the salesperson on the car. Dealer added 5 Lt of petrol on the car so did not have to rush to Petrol pump (Although I did venture anyway). Initial Review The car is extremely silent. Coming from a diesel vehicle (Duster), I was pleasantly surprised on how silent the cars can be. Even my swift petrol is not this silent. Fuel Economy The car always tries to be on EV mode (Eco mode) and with light foot (so far), I am easily hitting 27+ Fuel economy. Acceleration Tried all modes. Even in eco-mode it does move very quickly off the block. Amazing for a city ride. Have not pushed it beyond 80 Kmph but no complaints on its pickup NVH No complaints so far. Have not done a highway run so will update on this topic. Road Presence The car looks dashing. Looks grand on the outside and is well proportioned. On the exterior, you do feel the money is well spent. Interiors Could have been better. However coming from Duster, this was still an upgrade. One thing which bums me out are the driver side window pane buttons. They are not lit at night (Except auto button for windows) and gives total cheap Maruti feel. Cost cutting done at worst possible place. Front seats are comfortable but I believe for some of the oversized adults, the bucket seats may not be perfect Rear seats- Biggest issue is the rear bump. Had that been better managed the space would have been adequate. Currently only 2 adults and a child can manage. Media Center +HUD Android Auto and Apple car play works seamlessly and the screen is lag free which is pleasant. GPS with Android Auto gave me directions on my HUD as well as Tachometer. I am happy with the navigation feature on the HUD. Auto AC +Ventilated seats AC is effective (Although we are hitting winter in Delhi) and hope it will take care of thin sheet for sunroof. Ventilated seats are a blessing in scorching Delhi heat during summer season. Overall Verdict There has been a lot of confusion created over the car and its practicality. However, unless boot is a major concern (It is doable for weekend trips), the car looks and drives very well. You will not be disappointed ", 5th December 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Delhi,85,120

726, parattai , 22:04 ,Newbie,"Toyota Hyryder, My buying and initial ownership experience This is my first post in team-bhp. Thanks to the moderators for letting me be part of this great place . Thanks to all the experts and contributors for making this place very interesting and very useful at the same time. I have been a regular reader for more than a decade. In March 2018, our 2011 swift dzire ZDI (11500 kms on ODO) met with a big accident when my brother and his wife were riding it (no one except our car was hurt). Since then, my parents were pestering me to buy a new car. My father was willing to buy me a car. But, the car was brought into a good condition by the service centre, that I felt no difference at all. Around 2020, my wife and son also started to ask me for a car change, as our car felt very much outdated and their friends in our society have new cars with fancy features. After some discussion, we decided to buy a car after lock downs are over. In March 2022, after 150000 kms on the odometer of Swift dzire, we started to look out for a new sedan. My son wanted a sunroof and my wife wanted an automatic with more interior space. With these being the initial requirements we started our quest. Cars we considered initially. Honda City: Dakshin Honda, Hosur road is close to our house. We went there with family on a saturday. The sales team appeared understaffed. We had to wait for about 20 minutes before a sales person could greeted us. But we got a test drive immediately after that. The car felt more spacious and the drive was very smooth. The camera feed with left turn indicator is quite useful. The infotainment display and the instrument cluster felt bit outdated compared to any current generation car. The sunroof is OK. Boot space was great. There were talks about introduction of a Hybrid variant. So, we decided to wait. Skoda Slavia: The same day, we visited the Skoda showroom in outer ring road, Bangalore. The car looks more modern compared to Honda city. We got a test drive the 1.0 TSI TC variant very soon. The transmission was very smooth and the NVH levels were good too. The suspension felt better than Honda City & the sunroof is little bigger than the one is Honday city. The absence of physical buttons in the infotainment & the AC were a let-down. But, we were happy with the car and decided to book it after discussing lease conditions in my company. In the same week, my cousin bought a Hyundai Creta CVT OPT. We went for a long drive with him in the car and my son liked it more than the Slavia (more so because of the panoramic sunroof than anything else). He wanted us to buy Creta or any other car with panoramic sunroof. After a lot of discussion in family, we decided to look into cars with panoramic sunroof. Cars we considered after that. Hyundai Creta: I was happy with the car, but my wife wanted to try something outside Hyundai, as her cousin has had quite a troublesome ownership experience with an i10. MG Astor: We visited jubilant motors MG showroom in electronics city. The place is a little congested (no place for parking visitor vehicle), but the staff were very warm and soon we got to go for a long test drive (through NICE road). We got to experience the ADAS feature for the first time. (While inching behind another vehicle in the toll, there was a sudden break applied by the ADAS system, because I it though I might hit the vehicle in front. Then got to experience the lane assist and adaptive cruise control. The interior quality is better than other cars I have seen in this segment. The panoramic sunroof is massive. All these features and the interior quality impressed us so much that we immediately booked the top CVT variant of the car. Then our waiting period started. The SA promised me 2-3 months of waiting period, while the official communication indicated 3-4 months. Time passed and I kept getting calling the SA and was told about additional delays because of chip shortage. I kept following MG Astor thread in team-bhp and social media to get user feedback. Most of the complaints on this version has been about lack of power and yet a very low mileage, especially in city (kind of lowest in segment). Hyryder Launch By this time Hyryder went through it staggered, unveil, pricing and launch process. We were impressed with the Hybrid technology and booked the sporting red/black V Hybrid in Nandi Toyota, hosur road, within a week after reading the reviews, including the detailed one from team-bhp. l had told the SA that I would take any colour of the top variant if someone cancels. Test Drive: I got the test drive done on the same day the vehicle was available for test drive, thanks to an influential neighbour. The first thing that impressed everyone was that it moved like an EV without starting the engine. The engine turning-on and off is also quite subtle while on the move, but very noticeable when idling. The car has sufficient power at lower speeds for quick overtakes inside city. The ventilated seats are good, but very noisy (not sure if it is the same with every car). The HUD is a cool add-on, but not a necessary one. The sunroof is panoramic, but not as big as the ones in Creta or Astor, but the opening area is as big. Rear seat was spacious too. The boot space is a big let down. But we decided to be minimalist in packing for our travels and hold the booking. Delivery: One week after the delivery started for Toyota Hyryder, I got a call from my SA about a blue V hybrid, which was cancelled and I readily accepted the offer. I immediately started the lease related paper work in my office and cancelled my MG Astor booking. Nandi Toyota was very quick in getting the paper work, but it was delayed from my office because of Diwali. Meanwhile, I did a brief PDI and kept pushing the papers to next stages in my office & that of the leasing company. Finally 20 days after the initial call from SA, all the paperwork got done & took the delivery on a fine Friday evening (The car was ready in the morning and the number plate arrived by noon, but I waited for my son to come back from school, to see his excitement). All through the process, the SA was very courteous and promptly followed me through the process. I took the extended warranty and also ordered door edge protector, door visor, door sill and dash camera. Except the extended warranty and dash camera, none of the items came even after weeks of follow up. I rejected the dash camera, as it was an old stock (manufactured 2 years back). Initial user experience: The odometer was 26 when given to me, I took it home with my family. I filled the tank and reset the mileage and completed the pooja formalities on the same day. Using it for office commute mostly since then, in busy Bangalore traffic. Feature wise feedback: Comfort: On the driver seat, the right leg has ample of space, but the left leg seems to cramped for space. The foot rest/dead pedal provided is not in a convenient place for the left leg. I let it loose next to the foot rest. The front seats have a curved finish, which might make it unconfortable for fat people. The rear seats was able to fit 3 adults unlike what was said in many reviews (I (80 kgs) & 2 of my colleagues weighing 90+ were able to sit with our backs rested). NVH: The engine is silent, unless we push the accelerator much (or when it starts when idling). Vibration can also be felt when the engine is On when in idle state or in slow moving (read bumper to bumper traffic). When on free, the maximum contribution to the noise is from road. Headlights: The throw is good. The DRL is also bright enough. When set in Auto position, it automatically changes between DRL and Headlight. There are also guide to car and guide to home options which turn on the headlight for about 10 seconds after we lock or unlock the car [b]360 degree camera:[/B ]The image quality is bad, but serves the purpose. The rear view camera comes with both static and dynamic guide lines. There are alarms, which when enabled beeps when any other vehicle or object comes very close to the car (works even on sides). Mirrors: The Central Rear view mirror is automatic and the OVRMs are electric and works just like it is in any car with this feature. Doors: The front doors sometimes do not lock with light force sometimes, whereas the rear doors close well in my car even with light force. Sunroof: The glass is sufficiently tinted and does not let in everything. The blind provided for the sunroof is like a net only, but still never felt like it is letting too much light in. It seems to just let the right amount of light in to make the dark interior well lit, in the day time. AC: The automatic climate control is very effective. The AC and heater are good and acts fast. For control, an up/down know is provided. A circular knob would have been better. TPMS: It was blank on the first use, but was reading values (in kpa though, not in psi) from the next day onwards. Wireless charger: Functional, but the charging is slow when Apple car play/Android Auto is in use, acceptable when the phone is idle. Wireless Connectivity: The wireless android Auto and Apple car play works very smoothly. Media playback works very well. However the maps seems to have a big offset in showing the car location when starting the car in both my phones, but gets accurate after some time. This issue has never happened in the phones. So I believe the car's GPS unit is in use for maps and is probably not accurate. The turn-by-turn arrows appear in both the HUD and instrument panel, but it comes on google maps on Android and Apple maps only on iphone. Infotainment Display: The 9 inch display is big enough, the touch buttons are placed below the display for some fixed controls. It displays many useful information in the home screen. The user interface is very easy to use and responsive. Instrument cluster: The instrument cluster has plenty of useful information (like average speed in 5 min steps, average fuel efficiency in 5 min steps and over trips, power flow direction in hybrid operation, etc. There is a page for music info which never worked (neither in android auto/Apple car play nor in Bluetooth). I guess, it probably would come only for USB media. Hybrid system: The car runs from battery when driving slowly and even at high speeds when the pedal is not pressed hard, as long as there is two bars of battery. The Hybrid battery is charged when the engine is on (except when more power is needed requiring both engine and battery to power the wheels). The hybrid battery is charged when the legs are off the accelerator pedal (when coasting as well as braking). The engine is turned on when the battery drops to one bar or whenever high acceleration is needed. The engine is also turned on when the defroster or when high temperature is set (for heating). With cruise control speed set to 90 kmph on highway, the hybrid battery was powering the wheel half the time. Overall, the car runs on battery for about 50% of the time (both city and highway) resulting in double the fuel efficiency. Fuel Efficiency: This is where the car really excels. Despite driving in Bangalore city, even with an average speed of 10-12 kmph, the MID figure for most trips exceed 25 kmpl. Short trips seems to result in <20 kmpl (on MID). The lowest seen was <10 kmpl, twice on short trips with heater on in winter mornings. I did only one highway trip so far & mileage during the trip was 30 kmpl onward and 28 kmpl on return trip (max speed is 90). ", 11th December 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,6,36

I had taken TD of the car some days back at around 1 pm & felt that the sunroof is letting lots of heat in to the cabin. The temperature underneath the sunroof was way higher than the non-sunroof portion. This led me to believe that this will have an adverse impact on AC performance. Do you feel that way ?

Car will leave the factory on 20th and hopefully reach the yard by 24th. I have ordered a 3 M film for the top with maximum tint and UV absorption to reduce the greenhouse effect in the car. Getting 3M ceramic coating done and basic accessories like mud flap, matting, sun shades, scuff plates. Overall am very happy with the car. Rear space is narrow (similar to Yaris). G variant does not come with brown interiors I think. Engine does get noisy at times and one feels like driving a diesel. I am now used to the silky smooth and noiseless 4 pot from Toyota. How I wished Toyota had used the same Yaris engine. Cost cutting and efficiency seems to have taken the toll. Question to the existing Hyryder users. Do you use D or B during the city drive? I think B will give max regeneration in city drives. Highway one can use D on flat surfaces and B during inclines. I received a good resale for the Yaris (9.25 L from Toyota U Trust. Spinny and Cars24 had quoted 9.40, but went with Toyota for peace of mind). Had purchased the Yaris for 14.75 ( V Optional), so in all a good deal.

Might get around to making a longer post on the whole process and experience. For now - have some questions to fellow owners. The head unit has been popping some minor but annoying issues so wanted to see if others have noticed the same. The voice activation activates itself without any input.

Not even on the same flyover when I am on the other side - usually there is no traffic and I mostly zoom through when driving west bound. I understand there might be some kind of interference but the problems is that once it disconnects - it simply refuses to pair with the phone again. I even tried turning off the car while waiting for the traffic to move ahead and tried pairing it but to no avail. It only connects after a complete shut off and some time has passed. Someone has mentioned this on a previous post - google maps has a weird offset from your actual location (this doesn't happen everywhere). I have seen it happening in the Varthur road between Jagriti theater and the Kundalahalli underpass. Happened multiple times and not a one off incident.

For issues 1 and 2, they said they are aware of this problem. Apparently, some Glanza owners have complained too. Both the Hyryder and Glanza share the same HU. They have said they will call me when a fix becomes available. This is my first car with so many gizmos. Not sure if this kind of glitchy behavior is par for the course for modern cars.

If it's indeed the case, I might as well cancel my booking. These car companies have to understand the main USP of Hybrid/Diesel cars is their running cost. If they price the car too high this defeats the very purpose of these cars. The new GST rates itself is big letdown. Forget subsidies the new GST seem to be driving the cost of cars even higher. So what will a heavy user like me do. I might as well go towards buying a pre owned BS6 Diesel SUV.

Even for 20 lacs+ there is no premium feel and IMHO it is selling only due ultra low running costs. After test driving the G variant my nexon ev xm felt far more plush and premium as compared to this. The cabin is claustrophobic and the car feels busy overall. I thought that the engine noise would be bad but it turned out to be decent and bearable. The rear camera quality is enough to scare away a lot of prospective customers that tend to nitpick.

760, rajshenoy , 16:07 ,Senior - BHPian,"My corolla service was due and I thought of using their EM60 service so that I can finally go checkout Hyryder(strong hybrid) While I had my share of apprehensions, I came back surprised. let me revisit some of them 1. Power : Power feels adequate for urban usage thanks to the EV assist and is comparable in this segment. On highways too, should be ok for 100-120kmph usage 2. Build: Felt better then the usual Maruti Heartect cars, Rear Hatch felt heavy and doors felt tight than heavy 3. Ride quality : Short spin was not enough to comment on the handling but ride felt cushiony and the car could soak most of urban scenarios 4. Fuel economy: MID was showing 16.4 on an abused car and my 20 odd kms too were in similar ball park, so 28kmpl might be a tall claim but 16-18kmpl seems achievable for Bangalore traffic 5. Boot space : It is not as bad. I travel light and this should be sufficient for 2 Adults+2 kids and weekend luggage. Other good bits Sunroof has this neat trick that moves the rear pane and liberates awesome space. I like this much better then the panoramic sun roof that mostly serve like moon roof Not so good bits Drive modes felt gimmicky as I did not feel any noticeable difference in ECO, Normal or Power mode EV button was pretty useless(battery was showing full towards end of my drive, but EV didnt work. Apparently the EV mode works once you come to stand still and on handbrake and then move) Engine note feels very fake due to this EV assist and somehow could not enjoy it. It is not loud and well insulated but artificial Rear seat is not spacious for 3 adults(also that tunnel in middle) and all black theme does not look airy(sunroof and that mosquito net roof line perhaps helps brighten up) - I have the same problem with Seltos/Creta as well, So again nothing deal breaker for that segment.

761, sukrit7 , 17:08 ,BHPian,"Quick thoughts from a Delhi - Shimla - Delhi run. The car was loaded with four adults, an equal number of suitcases and backpacks and a few additional knick-knacks. Kms covered - 956 Overall average - 24.8kmpl. On the highway, the car performed rather reasonably. It was very comfortable for all of us, and the car held speeds quite easily. Didn't find overtaking to be much of a problem, although, on hard acceleration, it gets quite loud. Was able to touch a 115-120 with no trouble at all. I thoroughly enjoyed using the cruise control. On inclines, the engine becomes rather seriously hoarse as you gather speed. It sounds like a diesel and I wish there was a way to manually upshift at times. Having said so, this car can sure as hell climb. We have a home up in Chota Shimla, very close to Jakhu. It's a steep climb with very narrow roads. Where the EcoSport would seriously struggle, the Hyrder was absolutely cool. The combination of the torque available to you from the battery and hill hold made the experience absolutely fuss-free.

Luckily for me a Blue dual tone in V variant became available as the owner deferred the purchase so I agreed to upgrade from G to V as I was able to get the higher grade car at same price as I would have paid for the G variant. Over the years I feel that the car prices have risen astronomically; cars costing about 16 to 17 lakhs on road are now quoting 20 L plus.

When HyRyder got launched, we were already taking test drives and finalising Seltos but this launch made us sit back and wanting to know more of the Hybrid technology that Toyota was finally bringing to India. The day of the price announcement, which in itself was such a long and drawn out process, ended up with us booking the V Hybrid with the ₹25,000 payment. 6 month waiting period was quoted to us by the people at Toyota so the family had conceded the fact that we will enter 2023 with our i20.

I am pleasantly surprised by the car. Coming from diesel, this one pulls off quite well for 1.5L hybrid. The power mode has enough grunt and the gearbox is pretty good. The usual rubber band effect is vastly reduced. The suspension is brilliant, absorbs bad sections quite well and was fun pushing through corner as well. Is a bit on stiffer side but is comfortable. Steering is well calibrated too, weighs up decently on gaining speed and offers good feedback. Took for mild off-roading and immediately noticed how composed the car was. Good GC, stiffer suspension and the car crossed most of the section in EV mode. Did take it on incline where there are lose stones, traction control ensured that there was zero tire spin. To compare, my Fortuner and Thar in 2WD mode spins the tire for a moment. I did not explore any of the features but looked well kitted. Headroom in middle row is average and boot is quite small for the size. Only other negative I noticed was the sunroof cover, could have been of better quality. Positives -Fantastic engine tech, not super powerful but will keep most happy. Will be fun driving in city. - Very well tuned suspension, is fun to drive and at same time comfortable. Great GC to tackle bad roads. - Well tuned steering weighs up well as you build speed and light enough at parking speed. -Fantastic Fuel Economy - Car felt sturdy not featherlight like typical Maruti. Not super heavy either. Negatives - Smallish boot, could have been bigger. - The cabin was getting heated up mostly because of poor roof liner. Headroom at rear for tall passenger can be an issue. Barring minor negatives, the car has strong fundamentals and future tech, Impressive package to me. For someone looking for a car at 20-25L price range , must check this out before finalizing.

787, drsachin , 21:23 ,BHPian,"Most of these YouTube reviewers hardly do any proper research and keep posting such videos. None of them hardly put themselves in a buyer's shoes. I have been to both Hyryder and Grand Vitara showrooms and have booked Hyryder. So here are my views Grand vitara. 1.Most people who are Booking Grand vitara are those who have booked the mild hybrid version. Even guys at Nexa service accepted that ratio of mild to strong hybrid is 70:30. 2. A maruti buyer funds it difficult to buy any maruti car more than 15 LACs. Only those who are die hard maruti buyers and have not bought anything other other maruti , when looking for a diesel replacement are stretching budget to buy a hybrid ones. 3. In Delhi NCR large number of showrooms have ready availablity of strong hybrids. 4. Providing test rides of mild hybrids mainly. 5. Most traditional Maruti buyers like to keep replacing there cars with in 5/6 yrs. So like to buy cheaper cars only. Hyryder 1. Almost all bookings of Hyryder are of strong hybrids only. 2. People who are looking for Hyryder are taking base price as Rs15 LAC only. 3. Almost none of the showroom has ready delivery of strong hybrids. 4. Providing test rides of strong hybrids mainly. 5. Most traditional Toyota buyers keep their cars for long. 6. Many traditional Toyota buyers are giving Hyryder a miss as they find it to have maruti DNA. A buyer who is interested to buy mild hybrids will prefer maruti, it will definitely outsell Toyota. Mild hybrids being cheaper. A Nexa showroom person categorically told me that from January all mild hybrids for both Toyota and Maruti will be manufactured at Maruti plant only. And Toyota will be manufacturing strong hybrids one. Strong hybrids have too many production constraints. Supply of Battery and drive motor. Limitations of production at Toyota plant. So i will be more interested in stats of who is selling more strong hybrids before declaring if Hyryder have failed. Ofcourse Hyryder can still turn out to be failure and the primary reason is pricing only. Specially with the way Toyota has priced Innova Hycross. People including myself are finding better value in Hycross then Hyryder. Suddenly the Hyryder is now feeling overpriced for what it offers. But if i had to buy a strong hybrid , it has to be from Toyota only. For owning strong hybrid warranty is extremely important. Service personnel working on a hybrid must find out during a service visit about any faults in the functioning of hybrid systems and only then the warranties will come into picture in a timely manner before the vehicle goes out of warranty. I want to check battery, eCVT transmission functioning in every service visit. This is where I find more comfort in buying a strong hybrid from Toyota only. A see a typical maruti or a Hyundai service personnel to be only a engine oil, oil filter change guy only. I have never seen any maruti or a Hyundai service centre dedicating geniune time on a vehicle except Motorcraft service centres. Still maruti vehicles report lesser problems then the ones by other manufacturers due to use of simpler technologies only abd no other reason. Most maruti service centres are over worked unlike Toyota. Strong Hybrid technology is probably the first complex technology in use by any maruti vehicle and somehow I don't feel that an average maruti service personnel will either have time or expertise to service such a vehicle in a methodical way. Strong hybrids will be mostly preferred in cities where diesel vehicles have a shorter span.

797, baarish84 , 00:56 ,BHPian,"Change in driving style I have been driving Toyota Hyryder strong hybrid V variant since last one month and have completed 1200 km . I have observed that I have started driving more sedately, intentionally to extract maximum possible fuel efficiency. As a background for my daily driving conditions, my office is 20 km from my home. In the morning, there is free flowing traffic on Mumbai's eastern express Highway with average speed of 50 kmph. In the evening, traffic is comparatively slow paced. My annual running for last 10 years of driving has been between 10k to 12k , with 90% running within city limits . AC is running 100% of times. Earlier, I used to accelerate or brake fairly aggressively to keep up with the flow of the traffic. I am by no means a quick driver, who tailgates the vehicle in front of me. But if a space opens up, i would not hesitate to take it. I used to get 11 kmpl to 12 kmpl then on my Duster . On my Alto I used to get 15 kmpl to 16 kmpl in similar driving conditions / driving pattern. Now that I have been driving a hybrid vehicle, it seems car itself pushes you to be a conservative / frugal driver. (1) RPM gauge is replaced by power band meter . So you always know if you are accelerating too aggressively or economically. (2) HU has this nifty animation display which keeps on telling you whether car is running on battery or engine is powering you on. So you subconsciously start letting battery to charge as much as possible. (3) When car is running on battery, instruments cluster /HUD displays quite boldly that you are crusing in EV mode. Car becomes quieter and serene. Somehow , i have started trying to be on EV mode or to extract maximum fuel efficiency. Even if a space opens up, I try to accelerate gradually. As of now I am getting overall fuel efficiency of 20.5 kmpl in City traffic. Trying to push that number to 21 then to 22. Few days back, came across a youtube video about ""pulse and glide"" method of driving Hybrids. Have tried it few times , although felt difficult to master so far. Would like to know about FE numbers of other strong hybrid owners driving in City.", 30th December 2022,toyota-urban-cruiser,Mumbai,102,258
798, S2!!! , 01:23 ,Senior - BHPian,"It has been exactly a month since we've brought home our Toyota Hyryder, and incidentally, today was the first time the car has been tanked up since the last full tank was on the day of delivery on 30th November, 2022. Variant: Hybrid G The numbers: ODO: 910km Trip since reset: 875km Fuel efficiency: 21.5kpl Cycle: 100% city Driving Mode: 99% Eco, 1% Sport Likes: Smoothness and refinement Coming from a diesel A-Class, this one feels eerily quiet, with a faint whine in EV mode. When the petrol motor kicks in you can hear a mild purr, but it isn't ever crude or intrusive. Fuel efficiency Even though the A-Class was very efficient, this hybrid takes things to the next level. 21.5kpl in pure city driving conditions with AC on at all times is simply mind blowing. Performance It feels very peppy, especially while closing those gaps in traffic (even in Eco mode, which is the default mode in our car). Petrol with the electric assist is very responsive, and more than fuel efficiency, it was this instant power delivery which sealed the deal for us. Not talking about flat out acceleration, but it is the quick increments in speeds, when you want to momentarily up the pace in traffic, which is impressive. Ride quality It tackles potholes and bad roads really well, soaking in all the shocks. Suspension feels really well suited for urban conditions. LED headlamps I love the throw and spread of the auto LED lights. That they look stunning in the dark, as do the LED tail lamps, is only icing on the cake. Dislikes: Buggy touchscreen I love the fact that it has wireless Android Auto and Apple Carplay, however this is one of the worst softwares I've experienced in the recent times. When connected, if you dial or answer a phone call, you won't be able to hear anything after the first 5 seconds. The system freezes occassionally, and you have to switch off the car and open the door for the screen to turn off. Lastly, that annoying voice assistant keeps interrupting without any input. The latter two are issues you can't replicate, although the phone call issue is consistent. Horrible speakers Sound quality is absolutely rubbish - budget hatchback levels, to be honest. I tried playing with the equalizer settings so it did improve a bit, but it is still several notches below what the competition has to offer. Interestingly, the speakers in the V variant are decent compared to the ones in the G variant. Boot space I've done 1 airport run till date, and the boot can only fit in 1 large check in bag at a time. Not that we do a lot of outstation trips, but this could be a deal breaker for some. The sunshade for the panoramic sunroof is flimsy for sure, however I always keep it tucked away, so it hasn't been an issue so far. My car is due for the recall, so will be sending it for that as well as its first service in the second week of January 2023. Here's one picture of our car.

I have done the PDI this week and registration process is on. I wanted to install a dashcam but the dealer refused saying they do not have any official accessory.

Overtaking in highways was easy even with city drive-mode. 2. Fuel efficient. Getting 23.5kmpl with 85% city(Bangalore) and 15% highway driving and its still improving. A perfect solution for congested city like Bangalore. 3. Well tuned suspension and well weighted steering. Good grip from Apollo apterra tyres. 4. AC is effective and cools the cabin in no time. Dislikes 1. Issues with entertainment unit. Wireless Android auto disconnects frequently and it freezes sometimes. Fortunately, the wired Android auto works fine. Average sound quality from stock speaker in G variant. 2. build quality especially around doors and boot felt average/poor. Other observations 1. Brake bite is non-linear and very sharp.

This is just awesome. Suspension is a bit bumpy as compared to my Yaris which was very comfortable. Bumps and road undulations filter in. Rear seat is not very comfortable. Again comparing it to Yaris which had a more relaxed seating position, under thigh support could have been better. Front seats are very comfortable Sound system to my ears is good enough. Wireless ACP works seamlessly. Wireless charging is slow so prefer to charge with the 12V socket. Call quality is ok. Voice clarity of the microphone could be better. AC works really well. Ventilated seats are a blessing. Overtaking is not a problem. Just needs a bit of planning. Need to drive the car sedately car loves cruising at 100 kph. Climbing ghats in eco mode is no problem. This is my default mode for all terrain. Panoramic sunroof is awesome. Doesn't let the heat in. In fact I like the sun blind. Keeps the cabin airy. Installed a sun film on the sunroof for added effect. Engine tends to sound like a diesel in ghats. There is a strange clacking sound (has been posted above). Will show it to service centre during first service Speedy Blue dual tone looks attract a lot of attention. Gives the car a good character. Ambient lighting is nice.

806, Prakash Rao , 13:07 ,Newbie,"KEY DRAWBACKS (ARGUABLE INDEED) FOR THE KIND ATTENTION OF TOYOTA HQ. (Toyota Hyryder-V variant): Pls Note: The intention here is for HQ to hopefully consider these constructively and fix whatever is possible ASAP in 2023. Especially since the price is going-up even further! Buggy touch-screen/entertainment unit with faulty wireless Android Auto and a nagging voice prompt. Narrow front seats that lack most-basic thigh support and are pain-full during long journeys. Lack of lumbar-support cushion for front seats while replacing with 3rd party lumbar-support ensures no more ventilated seats. Car is ok for sedate driving, anything above 100Kph is a noticable struggle. Need to be extremely careful while overtaking. The huge camel-hump at rear defies imagination, most probably a Maruti designer's folly. Panaromic sunroof is big however the mosquito net protection/sun-blind is another design blunder. Delicate doors could be a safety issue. Non-linear front brakes create jerks at times TPMS is shows in KPa, instead of Psi, needs rectification by trained personnel. Age-old door panel buttons, steering wheel knobs.etc are proof that the car is just a Toyota-badged Maruti Suzuki, in and out. Cheapest, weakest horn is a reminder of the Maruthi 800 Incremental, flat-out acceleration after 80Kph speed is totally missing Insufficient boot space Multiple reports of tractor-type weird engine noise/loud clatter after 2nd service 360 camera is of very low quality Limited headroom at rear Extremely slow wireless charger Maps have a big offset in showing the car location, car's GPS inaccurate In case of an accident, a safety oriented collapsible pedal missing in most variants No cornering lights or curve-adaptive LED projectors Front Seat/head restraint geometry is very bad Are the Seatbelt pre-tensioners perfect? What was the precise reason for recall? Company needs to clarify. No park-assist features Adaptive air suspension with autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning (LDW) and emergency lane keeping (ELK) are missing, although standard in Hybrids at this high pricing! Child seat attachments (LATCH) are not so easily accessible Erratic Fuel Efficiency from 19 to 26 Kmpl on average No aftermarket accessories Major limitations of low-beam headlight (min 5 lux illumination) Cheap interior plastics feels more Maruti than Toyota, even in the top-end variant NVH levels from the comparatively weaker power-train are surprisingly poor for a hybrid, that too from Toyota Toyota Safety Sense 2.5+ Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection ought to have been provided at least in the V variant Company needs to reveal the Safety Assessment scores and crash worthiness NCAP ratings like Mahindra and Tata.

It has been exactly a month since we've brought home our Toyota Hyryder, and incidentally, today was the first time the car has been tanked up since the last full tank was on the day of delivery on 30th November, 2022. Variant: Hybrid G The Hyryder proved its mettle on a recent Mumbai-Nashik-Mumbai drive, with 4 passengers on board. Some key observations: - Performance on tap feels adequate for a sedate drive, especially if you keep speeds restricted to 100kph. The powertrain seamlessly shuttles between petrol and electric drive, and part throttle responses are crisp enough for overtakes. - When the petrol engine kicks in you can hear a muted grumble, and can feel a hint of vibrations on the seats, however it isn't to the tune of sounding coarse. These are only amplified because the car is dead silent and vibration-free in EV mode (you can hear a faint electric whine in EV mode though). - 'B' mode is very useful when driving down long slopes or hills, as it controls the vehicle from accelerating freely, thus keeping a check on its speed. - Suspension is well calibrated. Ride quality is pliant, and even on the highway, there were no unnecessary body movements. - Brakes need some getting used to as they bite rather suddenly. What I did notice is that if you are braking and the tyres hit a rough batch, the ABS gets very confused, much more than in any other car I've driven. - The panoramic sunroof and sunshade flood the cabin with heat, especially on a hot day, so you will find the AC working over time. That said, the AC does a rather decent job to keep the cabin temperature low, even at the back. - Voice assistant kept interrupting erratically. Speakers of G variant certainly leave a lot to be desired particularly on long drives. - Boot felt adequate for the weekend getaway. Took a medium check in bag, 1 overnighter and a soft cabin bag quite easily. - Nifty storage areas on either sides of the boot floor. Swallowed 3x 750ml bottles easily. - And finally here is the fuel efficiency at the end of the drive (I had reset the Trip meter before the journey). The MID reading is quite accurate from what I've learnt. As mentioned, the drive was sedate, and it also included multiple sections being stuck in dense bumper to bumper traffic on the highway and in the city.

811, zmachine , 22:34 ,Newbie,"I got the delivery of the G variant on 28th and did a Mumbai - Pune drive over the weekend. While there are many detailed reviews, here are my thoughts on the car: 1. Engine: It is not for enthusiasts, but after getting used to (if i can call it that) its not something that bothered me a lot. Overtaking was not an issue for me, but unlike my manual vento I was a little hesitant at first. The sound of the engine when you floor the accelerator forces you to drive conservatively I got an average of 20.5 roundtrip. 2. Doors: I hate them, the first few times I could not shut them in the first try. 3. Boot: You need to play some tetris, but a weekend trip with 3-4 people should be manageable for most people. I forgot to take a picture of the loaded boot but was pleasantly surprised to see 1 massive suitcase, a cabin bag and a couple of hand carry bags fit in. 4. Sun Roof: Its really nice when there is no sun overhead, but we left at noon and you can feel the sun shine through it. Not very uncomfortable but definitely a miss from Toyota and Maruti. Thought i hear some accessary is going to be launched soon. 5. Steering Wheel: I found it to be very thin, so will be getting a leather cover. If anyone has recommendations please do let me know. 6. Sound System: It's strictly okay, however i faced no issues with respect to call quality and no issues with the voice assistant (I have a feeling I may have disabled it while playing around). 7. NVH: Unacceptable for a 20L car, but its something you should get used to over time. 8. Seats: I'm 5'9"" and I found the seats to be okay, some additional under thigh support for the driver would be welcome especially for the tall drivers. I do not think there is any perfect car in this 20L category, but for someone like me who drives around 30km/day in bumper to bumper traffic with the occasional Mumbai - Pune (once or twice a month), this seemed to tick most boxes.", 2nd January 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,Mumbai,8,32

Two major things which I miss in the Yaris is the comfort in the rear seats (Hyryder is too upright) and the butter smooth engine which used to literally make no sound. How I wish Toyota had retained the 4 pot engine. I dont like Hyundai cars per se (no offence meant to owners) as they compromise on the ride and handling. The dealer attitude too leaves a lot to be desired as it is more take it or leave it. I have developed a good rapport with my T dealer who has managed to procure a Hyryder for me before the price hike I was focusing on FE since my driving has increased with a change in job profile.

829, Aldo280 , 15:47 ,Newbie,Hello members. This is my first post on the forum so I apologies in advance for any mistakes. I have booked Hyryder neo drive e (base) variant from Uttam Toyota and it seems I belong to the minority when it comes to booking hyryder as almost all the posts I have seen are for the hybrid version. I booked the Hyryder and not Grand Vitara as I liked the front of hyryder more than the GV and the difference in base model for GV and hyryder was just 3k. However Toyota dealers charge logistics and handling charges of Rs 6250 in my city which Nexa dealers don't. That takes the difference to almost 10k and I am willing to pay that for the front looks. I made the booking a month ago and dealership quoted 48 weeks waiting period for the neo drive(mild hybrid) version and 24 weeks for the hybrid version. I have not received any communication from Toyota about the booking although SA shared a computerized receipt a day later on WA as the booking was done after they had closed their systems for the day apparently. I have 2 questions. Has anyone refused to pay the logistics charges of 6k at the time of delivery and if yes what was the reaction of dealer at that and does one receive sms/email from Toyota acknowledging the booking?, 5th January 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,New,11,30

Since then I've made my peace with it. It's an unsettling sound but I could ignore it after driving it for an hour, not that I have a choice anymore, and I think it has also broken in a bit since then so maybe that has something to do with it. I've seen and read a lot of reviews on YT and TBHP and I was aware of what the manual says but none of what it says can accurately describe this sound or make sure you're ready for what you're going to hear. It sounds as if it's coming from a generator of some sort that can be specifically triggered when front defogger is turned on and in park position which also cranks the engine (as it should), that's when the car starts rumbling like a diesel generator as it's trying to charge the EV battery before switching to it. Maybe the cold wave of Delhi has something to do with it. I'm astounded that no one has specifically pointed this out in their reviews/observations. It does not sound normal to a new user, it's not at all hard to miss and it's really not that subtle because it even makes the floor vibrate. For someone who notices even the slightest of rattle or wind noise seeping through, It's more annoying than the front doors not closing and the wireless charger asking to realign.

Can you observe and report: Does the noise get muted after engine is warmed up? It could also be due to the fuel filled - does the noise get corrected after filling fuel? I guess the amount of fuel filled from factory is just enough for running the PDI and transportation distance only. We have a Kwid and M800 5 speed in our garage - and the newer kwid sounds really bad at cold start, but gets better after warming up. Same noise is seen in my sister's new Taigun 1.0 which is just a month old. Hence I am thinking if its something to do with the 3 cylinder engine characteristics. After this issue was reported, I checked many YouTube videos for the noise on Yaris cross hybrid, which comes with the same power train. None have a sound like in the Hyryder.

Should get the delivery by weekend or next week, based on RTO timings. Excited! Even though all was well during PDI, unfortunately delivery day has been terrible at Nandi Whitefield. Found one deep scratch on the back quarter panel and the cladding below, and small scratches on bonnet and front bumper of the car. They are saying they will repaint the quarter panel and the cladding and do overall detailing on the other areas and give it back, but just to arrive at this it took almost 4 hrs of us sitting hungry and waiting and trying to escalate. Till then they were saying this can be fixed by rubbing which didn't help at all, and in fact may have spoiled some of the paint on the quarter panel that now needs to be repainted. Have an email from their asst manager sales promising they will repaint the panel and replace the cladding (timeline for cladding replacement is not confirmed as they are checking with parts team) and detail the car to remove any and all other scratches. Request the opinion of other BHPians, 1) is it OK to accept a new car that now will have a repainted quarter panel? Will the fact that it's repainted will show up in a resale even though they are claiming it won't be on the service record. Won't they check with a light meter or something that shows imperfections in the painting compared to factory finish? 2) what other options are there for me to ensure Nandi Toyota stands by their words and deliver me the fixed car as promised? Unfortunately since all was well in the PDI, the car is now registered on my name, bank loan is active, Toyota iConnect is active on the car, and insurance is also active, and yet I don't have my car with me PS - we would have taken the delivery of the car with a promise of the issues being fixed had they owned up to the issue at the beginning and admitted that these scratches cannot be fixed by rubbing and buffing and given a clear commitment to fix it, but the fact it took them more than 4 hrs to arrive at this with a plethora of wrong messages trying to get us to ignore the issues and take the delivery, really got our goat.

Yes, I have observed that the engine stays on for a good while even without the defogger on If you've cold started the car early in the morning. It takes about 15-20 minutes for the temperature guage to reach optimal temps, and in that while, the EV battery gets fully charged and warmed up and you can hear snapping/clanking noises which Toyota has described as normal. If you're starting up that car a few hours later the car will turn on the engine to warm up but it will only charge the battery up to 2 bars. One way I found to forcefully bring it to use the battery is to restart the car on a stop light. So if you have 2 or more bars it will switch to EV mode quicker.

852, ZSFury , 14:43 ,Newbie,"I finally pulled the plug on my Hyryder strong hybrid purchase owing to the horrible sales experience I experienced with Ravindu Toyota Rajajinagar Bangalore. I pre booked the vehicle on 20th July 2022 via Toyotas website post confirming with the helpline that I would be able to cancel for a full refund if I am not happy post test drive. The next day I got a call from a sales executive at Ravindu Toyota, I asked to provide details of my booking. Strangely enough the booking experience was weird, I did not receive a booking reference number and no way to track my booking status online. There was then radio silence with regards to the launch and availability of the car for a test drive for the next couple of months. On 3rd Oct I received a message from the sales representative stating that the car would be unveiled in the showroom and that I could visit them for a Test drive. I booked a time slot with the sales representative and went to the showroom to check the vehicle out. My wife and I were made to wait for an hour and a half , without even being offered a bottle of water or being explained anything about the car on the shop floor. There was utter chaos with the test drives with people randomly jumping the line. I had to go find the sales representative and follow up multiple times to get the vehicle for a test drive. I finally managed to get the car for the test drive and by this time there were many disgruntled customers owing to the horrible management from Team Ravindu. owing to this I was allowed to drive the car for less than 0.5 kms. My wife was annoyed and the whole experience left a sour note, so much so that she hated the vehicle. I reached out to the CRM and outlined my experience post which they sent the vehicle home for a longer test drive. This test drive went well and I was convinced on buying the car. I was promised delivery by 1st week of Oct 2023. Once again there was radio silence from the dealership, I followed up 2nd week of Oct and was told I had to wait till Nov 1st week which then was revised to Dec 1st week. I followed up again this time I was told that they could allot a red V strong hybrid variant instead of my ordered dual tone red and black variant. the horrible sales person was recommending that I take delivery of the single tone Red variant and have it wrapped black. Their accounts team started hounding me with calls to obtain a loan from their guy even after I declined stating I had a prequalified loan and didn't need their services. Especially when they didn't even have a vehicle allotted. I finally decided that I didn't want to do any business with them any more and decided to cancel my booking. To cancel I was asked to go in person to the dealership and provide a letter and a cancelled cheque. I printed a letter at home and signed it and took it to the dealer who was now demanding that I hand write the letter instead of providing them with the one I had typed and taken print out off. I asked the sales rep to take a hike and asked him to process the refund. I will never ever do business with Ravindu Toyota ever!", 8th January 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bengaluru,6,31

My understanding was that CarPlay works on screen projection and it should be using my phone's location but that doesn't seem to be the case. Got a call from my SA at Nandi yesterday. They said they are still working with Toyota's technical team. According to him, they said there are complaints from every dealership in India on the GPS issues. He mentioned they might replace/repair the GPS sensors. The other HUD issues are also being looked into. The issue with my microphone where my voice sounds muffled to people on the phone is not a very commonly reported issue but there are a minority who have reported it. There was no ETA given though as to when a fix would be available ", 8th January 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,30,192

I would agree with you it is surprising to read, other Toyota dealers are behaving similarly. I used to own a Toyota corolla a while back in the US and I had gone in for an oil change, i was promised my car would be ready by 11:30 a.m. The service advisor come back to me at 11:35 with my car keys , says my car was ready but the apologized saying they went over the quoted time and said the services was free for that reason! While that is one extreme the situation here seems to be the other end of the spectrum with dealerships not caring for customers just because they have demand. A lot of them tend to put up with such behavior just so that they can get their vehicles.", 9th January 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bengaluru,6,31

Wanted to check who your SA was and how was your delivery experience. Anything to watch out for? Did you manage to get any discounts or free accessories? I booked in Nandi Queens Road branch. Had an excellent delivery experience. My SA Jithu was accommodating and didn't really push any extras. It is Toyota and a new model so expecting discounts would be too optimistic . I got my own insurance. The chap who was managing the finance/insurance told me about how other insurers make you wait but the package from Toyota would be totally cashless. That sounded a bit..weird. All it took was a call to Nandi's service centre where they put me through to the service in-charge. They confirmed as long as its not a PSU like New India, Oriental etc. - it is all cashless. The SA didn't push much either after that. There was some mandatory accessories of 4400 in the demand note for payment. I never sent it to them and they didn't pursue. They did throw in free floor mats and mudguards without asking - so that was nice. I requested a PDI and got the VIN beforehand. Once the manufacturing month was confirmed - the car was sent from the Banaswadi centre to Queens road for me to inspect. It was only after the PDI that I sent the payment.

They threw in a decent discount on the accessories availed (side step, door edge guard, door sill light, and sunroof film) to make up for botching up the delivery. A full tank of petrol was fed to the car, and she's finally home now.

874, Prakash Rao , 10:15 ,Newbie,"After almost 800Kms drive on my elder brother's month-old Hyryder (he was unable to log-in the necessary Kms before first service so offered it to me for a long-pending journey into Kerala and TN), I finally got my own Hyryder Strong Hybrid V variant (top-end) many days back. In midnight black colour that apparently is the highest in demand colour. KEY OBSERVATIONS & personal remarks: Delivery experience at Ravindu Toyata was satisfying. I would strongly recommend Mr. Mahesh Kumar MR (Asst. Manager) for those seeking a new vehicle from Toyota. Also Mr Satish the Showroom Manager. Mahesh has not only been proactive, professional & very helpful all along but ensured significant discounts too. A very dedicated, humble and honest guy who even suggested certain after-market accessories (eg; a side step) as unnecessary. I was lucky to get the SUV expedited and at same old price, although I am told the steep hike will be implemented anytime early, in this new year. I added on some original accessories supplied by Ravindu Toyata, prices are slightly higher at all showrooms but trust me: quality is tangibly better than after-market ones. Pls avoid after-market, inferior quality chrome garnish in particular, since they peel-off in no time. Super-silent (zero cabin noise) at slow speeds when it’s on EV mode. Only the sound of the ac is audible. NVH levels are excellent until around 60Kmph. Very smooth drive, good view and comfortable inside. Have been filling only good-quality, high-octane XP95 petrol, for obvious reasons. No issue overtaking on highways on power mode. Front-seat feels narrow and lumbar support is indeed missing. TPMS is strangely in KPa. The guy who gave a tech demo of the SUV's functionalities and Toyota i-Connect, had no clue and was unable to figure out how to switch to Psi. BTW, there is a YouTube video on how to change a Subaru’s Tire Pressure Monitoring System from kPa to PSi. Has anyone had success? TPMS recommended is 230 kPa for all tyres, but the car was delivered with kPa of 321 to 325 on all tyres, that is like 47 Psi on a tyre....crazy! (1 kPa equal to in 0.145 psi) Immediately after delivery, I went to a wheel-alignment/balancing garage and emptied the tyres. Refilled all the brand new Apollo Apterra Cross 17inch tyres with Nitrogen at 35 psi. The ride is incredibly-smooth now and vehicle literally glides over small potholes and humps. Commenting on the new tyres from Apollo (after a test drive), the experienced mechanic said that they appear to be not hard rubber like other brands (CEAT, MRF, Bridgestone), will offer maximum ride comfort, cornering stability, good road grip and low noise, however a longer life most-unlikely. He added that the only other similar tyres are those from Goodyear and Continental, but they are expensive. He mentioned some new tyre from CEAT called SecuraDrive, that's considered very good too with special pattern & grips to prevent aquaplaning. The innocent rookie who gave a demo of i-Connect mentioned that Andriod Auto works only on using a USB cable. However, once back at home, I was able to get Google Maps replicated on the display with Bluetooth and Wifi enabled on my phone. Voice activation activates itself without any input! Happens so often and its highly annoying and complete nuisance. Need to tell it to shut down, every time. Tried disabling but it activates on its own! Bidadi: Is the patch ready? CarPlay disconnects when you are speaking. Really disappointing, indeed. Mobile phone’s wireless charging spot is not easily accessible. I often get a Warning Message in Red on the display mentioning charging has stopped (I assume its mobile phone charging). It's probably got to do with the correct spot/positioning. Has anyone experienced the same? 390 degree view is indeed extremely beneficial for parking on very tight and narrow spaces. Camera quality could have been much better. Mileage fluctuates from 14 to 22 kmpl, I drive in city and have never hit more than 80 kmph. My AC is always on. Drove twice on NICE road at a pretty high speed and it was smooth, controlled and satisfying. Absolutely no wobbling even at 140Kmph, although noise levels are pretty high after 80Kmph, thanks to the 3 pot engine. Left leg's ankle keep's touching the hard surface near the centre console, and becomes painful after a while. Need to stick some soft rubber cushion. (Extra-thick furniture edge protector's high-dense Foam Cushion corner strip guards - 3M) The FM radio switches on by itself all of a sudden and at high volume! Totally embarrassing. I think it’s another bug that needs to be fixed asap by Toyota (along with so many other glitches in the Voice, Navigation & Entertainment/Electronics System) Rear door appears too tight to open. Perhaps it needs some usage. Ventilated seats are a big help. However it gets noisy at high speed setting #3. The tiny fan below your head (rear side of front seat) becomes audible and noisy. It is totally silent at 1 or 2 speed. Headlight is ok but the horn is a totally disappointment. You probably cannot change the headlight for brighter projector LED’s (150 + watts, 7000K + white light) since the bulbs are all sealed & non-detachable. AC is satisfactory, but cooling the entire car during daytime takes almost 30 minutes at full blast, even after all round, highest quality, imported sun-film fitted. Brakes are smooth and accelerator pedal is like a feather...very sensitive on EV mode HUD display is more of a gimmick. It's just an unwarranted diversion while driving. Would have been great of we had in-built navigation/maps on HUD...is there any hack to get it done? Cruise control is really a boon on the highways, although to those who have experienced, ‘adaptive cruise control’ would have been a big plus and unique differentiator, at least for this top-end variant. I bought it from Ravindu Toyota, Opposite to ISKCON TEMPLE, Rajajinagar, Blr. (Manager is Mr. Satish). A hands-on professional, I have noticed that he/team ensures excellent customer service standards to extent possible, while there are always some dissatisfied customers, partly due to the long waiting periods. Having driven abroad for over two decades, I am not used to honking too often, especially in our city roads. However, a powerful horn is an absolute must to anyone driving long-distance frequently, especially if the journey involves Ghats, hair-pin curves or narrow roads, broken/open dividers, villages....etc MODIFICATIONS Done: Got Sun-film (Llamar Brand-USA Made, Platinum series. Blocks 70% of heat, yet is transparent) on front and back windshields and well as all windows and sunshade. Pls note that the OEM glass is already tinted sufficiently as per standards. Installed most-luxurious 7D floor mats (after-market), combo of grey and black design. Kindly note that there is a huge price-difference between online and retail shops. Some BHPian had asked if they give a boot-mat for strong hybrid variant...Well, regretfully, during delivery all they give is a brown floor-paper to prevent soil. Minimal chrome garnish on front and rear, lower part of side doors. PPF coating/film only on handles and inside part (circular area) of the door handles. Also on door sill & scuff plate. Changed the lighting bulbs inside the car (yellow) to soft-white LED lights on front and rear ceiling/roof. Threw away the cheapest Minda OEM horns and got dual (4 nos) of the Hella Chrome Twin Tone horns installed, using vishnu horn wiring kit along with ADDITIONAL super-insulated wires with harness. The most-experienced and only specialised auto-electrician who does this niche-task in Blr, without even touching any of the original wiring (to maintain Warranty) is near Mathikere. Will ping back details to anyone interested with address/location. Warranty of all electrical systems will be intact, since nothing original is touched, while the new wiring is completely independent and direct from the battery under the hood. The trumpet-sounding horns are now extremely useful for highway/long-distance driving, especially the narrow roads and hairpin Ghats. Removed the stock-light on rear spoiler (stop-light) and replaced with double power LED lights. PENDING (minor tasks): Dual Channel Car Dash Cam, 3K, ADAS, Built-in GPS, Route Tracker, App Playback & Share, Parking Monitoring. 128GB. (Not yet convinced if the significant amount is justified on the Chinese item or really needed?) Foldable Windshield Sun Shade for front and rear (Lukzer) Universal Compatible Car Side Window Sun Shade Pullover (Lukzer) Portable Air Purifier Ionizer (Philips GoPure 3211?) Headrest pillow for neck support AND memory foam lumbar-support (badly-needed) for front seats. High performance 3 Way 6-Inch, coaxial car speaker with inbuilt PEI tweeter and HOP woofer. Door protector cushion & shock absorbing silicone gasket (circular stickers) Universal anti-scratch door sill car sticker decal for rear door/boot. LED tail brake light/turn signal indicator (carbon-fibre) Leather gear-shift knob cover Rat/mouse trap for engine bay and AC inputs vents. The servicing personnel mentioned that it will be installed (on request) during first servicing. FINAL NOTE: After over 800 Kms in two Hyryder’s (and having driven a Hybrid Sedan abroad for many years), I am convinced that this is a most-comfortable and satisfying HYBRID SUV, currently available in India. Considering the premium pricing (that is soon increasing too!), while there are many crucial functionalities missing and much-desired features needed from Toyota, on the whole, the vehicle is truly satisfying for city commuting as well as long-distance driving (you need to do some mandatory mod’s), provided: you are not one who habitually overtakes impulsively or loves to drive very fast all the time or pumps-up the adrenalin too often or goes off-road. Hoping these notes were beneficial and educating to my fellow BBPian’s. And Toyota Hyryder owner’s.", 16th January 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,23,78

Took the car for a 85KM drive today (Ghatkopar to Bhayandar and back) in Mumbai which comprised of 50-50 (highway and city) driving conditions. I use a Nexon EV max for this commute everyday and driving this after driving a EV was 70% similar experience, except when the engine kicks in when the car is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. The vibration is A LOT when engine starts on standstill car, maybe it's just because the engine is new or maybe it's just like that, will come to know over time. Do note maximum amount of times the Car is in EV mode during bumper to bumper except when the battery gets really low due to prolonged traffic. Also, I noticed that when i kept the car in neutral for a long time being stuck in traffic the cars MID threw a notification asking me to not be in N for too long since the battery is super low, i switched to D with foot on brake and only then it started charging the battery and during the entire day my battery never got charged beyond 3 bars , i attribute that to light foot driving since the car switches EV very often when doing that , as soon as it reached 2-3 bar and the car is cruising at 70Kmph it will switch to EV for 600-700 metres and then back to engine. Here comes the best part, I did reset the Avg. Fuel comsumption after tank full and this was the maiden trip, the car showed 27kmpl in the morning one way and when I came back home with decent amount of traffic, the car showed 25.3 Kmpl , this i admit is also due to light foot driving that i have been accustomed to buying the Nexon EV max.

Knee up in Nexon is really a big downer !

917, Prakash Rao , 08:07 ,Newbie,"After another 900 Kms across TN (compared to the pot-holed ridden and backbreaking humps in Karnataka, the flawless world-class highway passing through Krishnagiri is being asphalted again, despite being near perfect), I have some additional observations and personal remarks. I sincerely hope Toyota India HQ will take note, while it is indeed surprising that even after 6 months, the reputed, customer-centric-company has not released any software update/patch for the buggy, infotainment and navigation system in the Hyryder Hybrid. PROS: Excellent suspension, extremely smooth, provided you keep all the four tyre’s pressure within 210 kPa (31 psi) to 220 kPa (32 psi). Pls note that despite all tyre’s filled afresh with Nitrogen, yet the pressure increases while riding in hot sun on the highways. Most stable ride even at triple-digit speeds Manoeuvring across a bank or high kerb or sharp turn is comfortably stable even at high speeds. I tried on a very sharp turn at up to 80Km/hr. Any speed above this will probably be considered harsh cornering and unsafe for this SUV and I would say strictly not advisable. You will not only experience tire squealing but dangerously risk getting skidded, due to traction & control loss. Overtaking is a breeze. Thanks to the adrenaline boost from the extra power provided by the electric motor, you can literally overtake almost any vehicle in the city. Breaking is super-smooth, however hard you press the pedal. The regenerative braking helps better fuel economy without sacrificing performance. At lower speeds, the SUV is indeed totally quiet. Only the illuminated dashboard indicates the vehicle is on! Headlight is powerful enough. 360 degrees camera system is a major help for parking in tight spaces and narrow roads. ================================= CONS: Voice activation has to be disabled permanently. The large panoramic sunroof is a big problem. A blunder or sales gimmick with absolutely no serious benefit. Not only does it eat-up precious headroom, it gets so unbelievably hot in the afternoon that the AC at full blast, is hardly effective! Since the sun-film I installed is of no tangible use, I recently got a very large silver foil tucked in carefully between the glass and the netted cloth mesh. However, it still heats-up the car. There is a feature which increases the volume automatically depending on the increase in speed to compensate the outside road noise. Despite deactivating this, the FM radio suddenly switches on at high volume. It is not only a nuisance but very embarrassing too, especially at traffic signals. The HUD (even when linked with Android Auto) is useless and more of a distraction. You can use the large screen of the main display and shut-down the HUD permanently. Opening the rear door using the key would have been a big help. Ventilated seats (even at setting #3) are not powerful enough on a hot day. And the highest setting is too noisy. ACC ought to have been offered. Those who have driven long distance with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). will agree that it is a major feature that is missing and is most relevant for Indian highways. Basically, if the car ahead slows down, the ACC can automatically match it. After driving over 150Kms, you will experince pain in the buttock and back, because of total lack of lumbar support combined with a narrow seat. Despite changing posture often, the pain sustains! I have noticed some relief with a small sized, ultra-soft headrest pillow attached (strap-on) to the seat. ", 30th January 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,23,78

922, Cruzn , 20:12 ,BHPian,"Some tips I found online on how to maximize FE with hybrid vehicles: Use your cars hybrid information display to monitor energy usage. Dont put your pedal to the metal. Go easy on the accelerator and press it lightly and consistently to keep the car in EV mode. Use the ECO mode to get better fuel economy. Brake gently and early to allow the EV mode to operate longer. Use cruise control to maintain an even speed. Set the AC on recirculate, which saves energy. Dont select N neutral when stationary in stop-start traffic because it will discharge the hybrid battery and fail to generate electricity. Using the cars battery will save the most energy when driving. In city driving situations, accelerate to the desired speed and then ease off the pedal, then ease back on.

Later he also told me that they deliver just around 30 Hyryder cars per month. My car which was expected around April or May might be delivered early next month only as there has been numerous cancellations. Last month i also checked at Nexa showroom, grand vitara strong hybrids are readily available. Both the showrooms were almost empty even on weekend in the evening time with noone checking their newly launched cars. I have been to these showrooms numerous times in last 2 months and have rarely seen any Grand vitara hybrid or Hyryder getting delivered, not the kind of scene you see in newly launched in demand cars. I really don't know what is going on. To me it seems Both the companies are artificially creating an adverse Demand supply ratio. This price increase might be their way of letting everyone know that the strong hybrid car is in huge demand. Or they may genuinely have poor production capacities. Anyway whatever may be the reason all those who have booked the car may not take this price increase kindly. Many in my family members were finding this car overpriced but now with this price increase i too might cancel my booking soon.

Hence its cheaper for Maruti and a bit expensive for Toyota. GV or Hyryder strong hybrid - The whole car is made by Suzuki except the TNGA 1.5L 3 cyl engine along with eCVT transmission.

We all know both cars (Grand Vitara and Hyryder) are manufactured by Toyota at their bidadi plant till December 2022 that includes both mild and strong hybrids. But a dealer at Nexa showroom confirmed that from January 2023 onwards the mild hybrid Variants of both manufacturers will be manufactured at Maruti plant, while the strong hybrids will continue to be manufactured at Toyota Bidadi plant. Their is another interesting thing about vehicle identification. I am getting delivery of my Hyryder V-Hybrid strong hybrid within a week. It's a Jan 2023 manufactured car. the VIN number series is straight from Maruti and not Toyota. Maruti uses 17 digit VIN number (11th and 10th digit is Year and month of manufacturing ,while Toyota uses 22 digit VIN number with last 4 digits suggest year and month of manufacturing). The VIN number of Hycross is 22 digit only. The VIN decoder websites also read Hyryder as maruti vehicle only. So is it possible that the vehicles manufactured at Toyota plants carry Toyota VIN series while those manufactured at Maruti carry Maruti VIN series. So that means even strong hybrids are now being manufactured at Maruti plant only. Just wanted to know from those who got 2022 manufacturerd strong hybrids about their VIN number. Is it 22 or 17 digit. Will it affect quality of manufacturing if car is manufactured at Maruti or Toyota plant.

942, Cruzn , 12:41 ,BHPian,"Finally received my S variant after 4 months. Before I mention my experience, I would like to also talk about how I came to this decision. I used to have a 2019 EcoSport AT which I treasured. It was an absolute joy to drive and would never had given it up if it wasnt for the mileage. With the current rate of petrol and a mileage of 10 km/l, I was spending 10k a month just to fill her up. I heard about the Taigun having a slightly better mileage and also with the same fun experience, so decided to take a look. I had pretty much decided on the Taigun and doing the test drive was just going to be a formality. One morning, while my family was getting ready to go for the test drive, I was surfing on YouTube and came across a video for Toyotas next vehicle. I saw the word Hybrid and immediately remembered my experience when I first drove the Prius a few years back in the US. I told my family that we arent going anywhere. I decided that I would wait and see how this turned out. As we all saw, the launch was a disaster with the pricing being so secretive for quite a few days. Nevertheless, I was still adamant about checking the car out. Pre delivery experience: I had initially booked the G variant with Nandi Toyota (Banaswadi) on October 10th. After my second test drive on October 20th, I noticed the cabin was warmer than usual. Driving the V variant I realised that the sunroof was the cause. I then decided to downgrade to the S variant. Looking at some of the reviews here, I'm glad I did! Apart from the extra airbags, I don't miss the other features missing between the G and the S variants. My SA Richard was kind enough to keep me posted on the status periodically. My only concern was selling my EcoSport on time so that I can make the payment as soon as the PDI was done. The day of the PDI, I received a quote from Spinny but decided to go with Toyota instead so that I could drive in with my EcoSport and drive out with my Hyryder. Unfortunately, that couldn't happen as Toyota's policy was to complete the trade in process before the delivery. This was the only disappointment in my entire experience with Toyota. I just wished I had another day with my EcoSport. Post Delivery : Received my car on Feb 5th. Now weve all read and watched the reviews, so Im not going to repeat the same. However I would like to repeat that it is awfully quiet on EV mode. I hadnt informed my driver and he ended up restarting the car about 4 times before he realised that the car was actually on. Hence, please inform your drivers. The pros are the same as others have mentioned so will go through some of the cons (some of which have also been mentioned by others) that Ive noticed so far after 300 km: The driver door does not close easily. On average both my driver and I take at least 3 attempts to close it. This was something I noticed during my test drives and PDI as well but was told this is normal. Is it though? The other doors are fine but is there a reason that this happens only with the drivers door? Its 2023 and we still see cars with just 2 airbags. We keep reading about how automakers care about their customers. Really Toyota?!?! Finally, this is in no way a fun car to drive. But I try and make it fun by achieving the best mileage I can on every drive. My driver and I do get some honking and abuses hurled at us once in a while but thats alright, we still reach our destination safely, on time and with an average mileage of 27.6 km/l. Havent seen a lot of reviews on the S variant, so please feel free to contact me for queries.", 12th February 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,64,250

Went to finalize the Hyryder with my dad but came back dropping the plan completely. The recent price hike means it has crossed 24 lakhs on road. This means it almost same as the Honda City e:HEV. And having done the official review of both, the City was far more superior product than the Hyryder. Better NVH and proper 4 cylinder engine, better rear seat comfort, more premium interiors and it has ADAS additional as well as e-parking brake with auto hold. All this elevates the City above the Hyryder. However the deal breaker was not just the price. My dad simply found it uncomfortable to get in and out of. The seat height was perfect and once seated the seats were comfortable with good legroom. But the entry for the feet was too narrow at the back. He could get in but even that needed him to twist his knee a bit more. While getting out his shoe kept getting stuck in the narrow gap between pillar and rear bench. To compound matters the foot well depth from the edge of running board was a lot more than all my other cars. Which means when getting out, you need to lift your legs up a lot more and then twist your foot out. He just said this was not what he wanted from a 24L car and if it was close to his Corolla level of comfort he would have been ok.

Regarding Honda it's definitely a better product then Hyryder, but couple of things did hold me back. First sedans in C-Segment is a dying species. Thats probably the reason Honda choose to bring City Hybrid through CKD route. Not many are buying Honda city hybrid, the poor sales may force honda to pull the plug on Honda Hybrid anytime. Third the fate of Honda in India doesn't look good. No exciting launches since a long time. They have falling sales not just in India but accross the world. Even Toyota has dwindling sales accross the world due to Electric vehicles phenomenon, still they are far better placed then Honda , and their association with Maruti in India is really rewarding.

It's a completely different experience to my City, loved the super silent nature of the car, was not too loud even when the engine switches on. One thing I found wierd is that when you do a quick overtake the engine quickly starts and stops only for a few seconds, not sure how much of an impact that'll have on the Battery and the Starter Generator having repeatedly have to start and stop the engine for quick overtakes in the city traffic. The interiors and exteriors felt well put together, but the boot space as expected was a big disappointment. Thought they now have a piece of flat cladded plastic which makes the rear boot flat instead of a step like structure with the battery in the boot. The rear view camera truly did not belong in a 24L car, was truly disappointing even in reasonably good light. Hoping to see some improvement over here.

952, S2!!! , 20:26 ,Senior - BHPian,"The Hyryder packs in connected car tech for those of you who weren't aware. There's an e-SIM in the vehicle which you can remotely connect to via a Toyota I-Connect mobile application. Having used this app for over a month now, here's what I think of it: Seamless connection Having installed the application, you need to register your vehicle by punching in your chassis number and registered mobile number. From thereon the login process is pretty straightforward, and you can unlock it using your phone's finger print sensor as well. Simple interface Once logged in, everything is very simple and straightforward. The main functions are right out there, and one doesn't need to enter multiple sub-menus to perform any function or access any information. Limited features You can start the motor and switch on the air-con to pre-cool the cabin before setting off, lock the vehicle and switch on the hazard lights for 30 seconds (to locate the vehicle in a parking lot). What's also nice is that it pinpoints the accurate GPS location of the vehicle, and you can also create a geo fence, speed restrictions and driver alerts should you wish to monitor how your chauffeur or someone else is driving your car.

957, drsachin , 00:53 ,BHPian,"Finally got the delivery of my Hyryder today. Had booked my Hyryder in Red/Black colour G-Hybrid Variant on 18/11/23 at Espirit Toyota Noida Was waiting eagerly for delivery since my booking. Although the verbal assurance was given for delivery by March 2023 but on booking form, confirmed delivery time was 7/8 months. In the the mean time we checked a number of Petrol Automatics from XUV700/MG Hector/Astor/Carens/Seltos/Alcazar/Creta/Kushaq/Slavia/Virtus/Taigun/XL6/Brezza and lastly even Innova Hycross. The list is quite exhaustive as i am spending 20-22LAC and moving from manual to automatic. So I wanted to be 100% sure about which car i wanted. Although no car fulfilled all my criteria, Hyryder came close to fulfilling most of my requirements with least compromises. No car came close to practicality for heavy city users like me. Never considered any electric (BEV) due to concerns of poor charging infrastructure. Although I had booked Red/Black during recent visits.Last week when i visited my showroom we closely watched both dual tone cars used by showroom for test drive vehicles(Blue/black and Red/black). These test drive vehicles had been in use since October 2022. Within four months of use the Red/Black shade appeared very dull compared to Blue/Black.Apparently the Red/Black colour appeared good only when newly polished. My family wanted me to buy which ever is available earlier but they now preferred Blue/Black over Red/black. I just hinted the supervisor that we are ready to be a little liberal with colour options if provided with early delivery. The supervisor checked the status in stockyard and came back with the news that a Blue/Black Hyryder is available but in V-Hybrid not G-Hybrid.With the recent price rise all the variants were already dearer by about Rs50000 and addition of another Rs 170000 for V-Hybrid my budget would have increased by Rs 2.5LAC and I was certainly not ready for it. Then to my surprise the supervisor suggested that if i accept the V-Hybrid they are ready to offer it on Jan 2023 rates. So now i am presented with two options either to wait for another 2/3 months for my G-Hybrid Variant or buy V-Hybrid on older rates. I thought may be the dealer is passing on some 2022 stock to me but the supervisor assured it's a Jan 2023 vehicle and recently received by showroom on 23/1/23 only. For all practical purposes the price difference for me was Rs 115000 or even lower in the event of another price rise if i wait for G-Hybrid. Needless to say my family readily accepted the offer without showing any excitement . I wanted them to either allow me insurance from outside to try to meet the lowest quote available to me from my agent. They agreed for both. I wanted PDI of the vehicle before the payment which was provided on Saturday(11/2/23). After thoroughly checking the vehicle i did full and final payment on Monday (13/2/23). The lowest insurance quote from my agent was Rs 40000/ from Tata AIG(Royal Sundaram quote was even lower at Rs37000 but i preferred Tata AIG). The dealer checked with its own agent but the lowest they could provide was Rs55000 from Bajaj Allianz. They agreed to allow me insurance from outside. I requested them to remove logistics charges also to which they refused saying all Toyota dealers are charging it and it's actually on the instructions of Toyota itself. I further negotiated to include some free accessories such as 3D floor Mat, Mudflap, 3D boot mat which they reluctantly agreed. No other paid accessories were forced on me besides the complimentary ones. The delivery date and time was decided for today(16/2/23) 4pm. I was called again yesterday to the showroom for another final PDI before they send the form 22 for registration. By evening I got the message from Vahan portal containing details of registration number allotted to me and amount received as registeration charges. Today I messaged them at 12pm, about other accessories i wanted on additional payment. I reached the showroom at 4pm with my family. In the showroom i was greeted by the Toyota team , a table was reserved for my family with my name plate on it. My daughter was gifted a beautiful teddy bear. A customary cake cutting with family photographs were done. I paid for accessories in cash. I was provided with all the receipts, invoice, insurance, extended warranty certificates. I was explained all Toyota iconnect features. Later we were taken to another room where my car was ready with all the accessories on it. The car was covered in a red cloth. I removed the red cloth and again the whole family was clicked with the new shinning car. I was given a demo of about 30minutes, explaining all the features. Fuel tank was filled with about 5litres of petrol. And finally after thanking everyone and paying some token tips to Guards and cleaners we drove out of the showroom in my new car. On the way I filled the fuel tank with XP95 petrol at IOL petrol pump, checked tyre pressures as suggested elsewhere in the forum. We did car Pooja and reached home at around 9pm. Provided some details of package 1. Ex-Showroom price Rs 191900 2. TCS Rs 19190 3. Extended warranty Rs 18771 4. Logistic charges Rs 6250 5. Road tax and registration Rs 194030(Up14), although as per the message from Vahan portal they have received Rs 192500. 6. Insurance from own agent Tata AIG Rs 40554 ( IDV 1823050, includes Zero dep, Engine Protection, Tyre Protection, Key replacement, return to invoice, Loss of personal belongings, emergency transport and hotel expenses, consumables , RSA). So if these i didn't need but they were provided as package by the company. 7. Accessories Rs 8371 includes paid( Door edge Protector, Door Visor premium with chrome SS insert, Body side moulding chrome, rear door lid Garnish, Rear reflector Garnish Chrome) and complimentary (3D floor mats, 3D boot mats, Mudflap). All in all i am quite happy with my showroom experience at Espirit Toyota Noida. I am quite happy with everyone involved including (Vishwaji, Deepak, Abhinav, Mamta). I would rate them 10/10. I am expecting a refund of Rs 194030, the registration and road tax by the RTO and may be another Rs 1 lakh as subsidy if am within initial 25000 buyers of BEV, HEV policy announced UP cabinet. As per news reports they are starting refunds sooner. Attaching Some photographs", 17th February 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,Ghaziabad,134,409

But I instantly confirmed from two Toyota workshops (Galaxy Toyota Delhi, Uttam Toyota , Noida) and they confirmed that Toyota does honour cashless claims from Tata AIG customers. Quotes obtained by me from my own agent and direct from insurance companies were. 1. Tata AIG- Rs40500(Own agent) 2. Royal Sundaram - Rs38000(Direct company).Royal Sundaram representative said , as part of company policy engine protection is considered part of Zero-Dep. Initial quote 48k later revised to 44k. Finally reduced to 38k. 3. Acko- 38k. IDV for all the quotes from different companies is 1823050(5% less than Ex- showroom) And none of the quote had any deductibles other than mandatory. I choose Tata AIG as the quote included lot of add-on including those which I may never need (Were offered as a package). Also since it's from my own agent. And third i think although Royal Sundaram is also a good company but it sounds more like a South Indian company. And I don't know how good it's coverage is in North India. Acko's quote was obtained only for negotiation purpose from other companies. The only downside i could figure out is the possible duration of Zero Dep coverage. I know Iffko Tokio provides Zero- Dep till 10years of vehicle age. And most other companies including Tata AIG provides zero dep coverage till 5 years only. I would like to know from others if Iffko Tokio allows Zero dep coverage to policy holders who port into their company at the end of 5 years.?

I had comprehensive insurance, first their surveyor took a long time to clear claim. And later their surveyor included numerous parts in 50% depression (Mostly those with composite material).My car was 3 year old then. And numerous others (Wires, Harness)in consumables which had 100% depreciation. While there is no proper definition for consumables or composites, i shared literature with him to show which parts to be taken as metals or consumables. Later after numerous complaints the company included few parts from consumables to 50% dep. The whole process left a bitter taste, and i never renewed any insurance for any of my cars with them. The whole claim process was not at all smooth. My car was with the workshop for about a month. And insurance company almost wasted 15days of those. The surveyor during conversation appeared poorly educated, but he was a stubborn guy. Never had these issues with other companies such as(Tata AIG, National Insurance).

968, drsachin , 12:53 ,BHPian,"I have done 300kms till now , so here is my initial review. Pros 1. Build quality: After my car reached home from the showroom. The very next day while I was taking out my car from basement 2 towards basement 1 on the ramp . I saw a wagonR going ahead of me but stopped suddenly once it reached basement 1. I patiently waited at the start of ramp on basement 2 for wagonR to clear the ramp. After 5 mins the car started but the driver lost control and instead of moving ahead started rolling backwards and before I could do anything it crashed on my car. The car was atleast 5/6 meters ahead of me when it started rolling back. My heart almost came to my mouth and i was sure a big damage has happened. The car had only 30kms on ODO. Based on my experience with my previous car fluidic verna i was sure the radiator would have been damaged. I slowly brought my car to safety and when i checked the car, to my disbelief there was none. I took out the car in sunlight and could only spot a small barely noticeable dent on Bonet and a small crack on the grey grill. The bumper had slightly come off the fender latches on both sides but moved back easily on moderate pressure. The wagonR on the other hand had a big dent on the boot door and the rear bumper. So this incident has reassured my belief in car build quality in areas where it matter the most. The car doors are definitely light specially the rear ones. The driver side doors have adequate weight. They appear noticeable heavier then the display car in the showroom. It seems they have improved in the 2023 car, not sure though. The doors also close in single attempt unlike the showroom car. 2. Gearbox. Gear box is super smooth. I have driven numerous automatic cars in last 3 months but this automatic gear box feels best. The power delivery is adequate and on demand. It appears even better than DCT gearbox, thanks to EV boost when required. The changeover from EV to engine mode is flawless. The only time there is a jerk is when the engine powers up while the car is on Parking mode. NVH levels of 3 cylinder engine is acceptable and during the move i have to check the EV/Engine shifter demo on the display to know which mode it's operating. Yes when you go full throttle only then it has grunt of a diesel engine. 3. Power delivery: Pick up is really good specially for the city. EV boost really helps closing gaps and overtaking. Not driven more than 70kms/hr yet but driving this car is absolute fun in city traffic. 4. HUD: This is the feature i am enjoying the most and now it has become my must use among feature list. It helps keeping the eyes on the road ahead without checking the mode(P, R, N, D, B) on the gear stick which could be dangerous for a newbie automatic driver like me. Also Google map directions on the HUD is a bliss. Helps you in challan prone Delhi roads to keep speeds within limits. 5. 360 camera. Again a must have feature for a raised SUV in both congested parkings and traffic jams where the front and left areas become blind spots. It helps negotiating tight roads. It's a boon in Delhi traffic jams, where a 2 meter gap is occupied by another car and 0.5 meter gap is used by bikers to crisscross. Now the front camera helps in closing this gap. . 6. Inside space. While the front is roomier and front seats are too comfortable. The rear seats are upright so old people used to sedans will complain and only 3 adults of moderate build can only fit. The rear AC ducts are also intrusive. 7. Brakes No complaints. 8. Fuel economy: Driven only in the city and large part of it in bumper to bumper traffic where even diesel cars return poor economy. My average till now is 19kms/litre and rising everyday. 9. Music system: Touch response is good, far better than the newly launched MG hector which I checked few days back. The speakers in V- Hybrid are really good , may not be comparable to Bose or JBL in other cars but i have no complaints. Twitters could be better though. With G-Hybrid i felt the need to swap the OEM speakers to aftermarket ones. 10. Suspension is really good and has a European car feel. It's on stiffer side. Cons 1. AC: The summers have just started and ac feels barely adequate. Contrary to popular belief i think it's not because of the mosquito net shade but it's actually due to the Pano sunroof. It almost becomes a glass house due to big sunroof with heat entrapped beneath it. 2. Voice controls. I really don't know what do they do. With almost every command they either say this function is not supported or they refer to Android auto. I wish the Android auto voice controls should also have been supported by stearing mounted control. 3. Placement of steering controls. Although the steering response is good, so is the the steering feel , the placement of steering controls is just not good specially the music system controls. Also i feel the 360 camera button should also be steering mounted. 4. Fuel economy display shows average economy or instantaneous economy. But i wish it also included fuel economy since every tank fill. 5. Thick A pillars. A piller is a big time blind spot 6. Horn is very weak. 7. Some rattle sounds from rear seat. I really don't know where it's coming 8. Official accessories: a) Don't buy official Door Visors or floor mats. Whosoever designed the official door Visors did so while sleeping. It increases the already thick A-Pillar to almost double. A big time no. My wife wants me to remove it immediately. b) Official 3D Floor mats don't cover paddle areas where it's needed the most. The dead pedal is totally exposed and it's only carpet there. So don't buy unless provided complimentary.", 23rd February 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,Ghaziabad,134,409

Thats a big lie and height of manipulative practice. My Toyota insurance agent too initially shared the same battery shield add-on picture. But now he agrees there is no such add-on approved by IRDA yet. Infact even for proper electric vehicles there is no special battery or motor protection add-on besides usual Engine Protection. EV buyers only get 15% discount on Third party , rest all policy wordings are same. IRDA is yet to come up with any such add-on approvals. I also saw insurance policies of buyers who got insurance through ""Toyota protect"". Their policy has no such words mentioning ""Battery protection/Motor protection"" or even ""Toyota protect"". I confirmed from a friend of mine who works as a ""Freelance surveyor"". He too confirmed there is no difference in claims made on policies acquired through usual insurance Agents or fancied OEM brokers such as ""Honda assure or Toyota protect"" Then i checked.with insurance companies directly. And almost all of them said that there is no Such battery or motor add-on. And infact you don't even need ""Engine Protection"" if you have taken ""Zero Dep"" . As zero dep covers bumper to bumper for all accidental claims with few exceptions. Almost all of them suggested to avoid Engine protection add-on if taking""Zero dep cover"". Engine protection only covers few exceptional non-accidental damages such as floods etc. Same goes with Tyre protection. Tyre are covered in ""Zero dep"" if damaged in accidents.

Or in worse case AC itself is not effective. I had initially considered this option of excess tinting as well but then realised it would defeat the purpose of having a panoramic sunroof. Having an additional cloth on the net might not be practical especially when you want to open the sunroof as this could cause it to get stuck when it folds. This might lead to further issues. Definitely wouldn't suggest that. Haven't heard a single issue yet with the AC but wouldn't hurt to get that checked.

973, Prakash Rao , 15:21 ,Newbie,"As some one who first coined the term 'mosquito mesh' for the protective, synthetic cloth-cover in sunroof (strangely everyone seems to call it as a mosquito mesh nowadays, while it indeed does the job to capturing all unwanted things, including leaves, paper, empty ciggratte packs & buts, deadly spiders, insects, used pan parag sachets, used tissue paper, pototo chips packs, all sorts of flying trash on the road, when sun-roof is opened): let me humbly offer some inputs. The AC is indeed weak. It simply cant handle the large area inside the SUV. Sunfilm tining of ALL exposed windows is a absolute must. Suggest you keep the AC on, all the time. Fyi, since we have a full/strong hybrid, the AC unit has a independant, electrical power unit. Install a high quality tint/film for sun-roof too. Almost all mechanics instal only the RTO approved sunfilms. (Pls read my earlier post on what brand..etc) But this alone won't suffice. Place/stick a super-thin silver foil (the type that is used to pack rothi/naan, underneath the glass of the sun roof. Use a thin double-sided tape to stick it. This will magically improve the coolness inside the Hyryder! Btw, a roll of silver wrapper costs peanuts. If you can't get a most affordable silver foil for whatever reason, stick the Kelloggs Cornflakes large eco pack cover, after flattening it out. The cover has silver foil lining on the inside. Perhaps this will give you an idea of how 100% of heat can be blocked out. Btw, pls note that this solution will not let you open/close the sunroof, which is anyway a completely unwanted thinge in this hot indian summer. Aside to all this, changing the most-dissapointing, pathetic horn is mandatory. With foresight, better do it before a too expensive accident! Its just a plug & play on the horn sockets. No wires cut or skinned..etc, hence warranty intact. However, pls do it with a experienced mechanic who knows how to open the front bumper & put it back on properly. If you are into long distance driving, lumbar support is really needed. Until 3rd servicing fill only high octane petrol. For ease of changing drive modes, purchase a cushioned, leather gear-shift cover. Will send snaps on request. Talking about safety & investment, buy a good, reliable, high quality dashcam. After extensive research & feedback from drivers & mechanics, the indisputably best available in India is the Viofo A129 pro.

Had Suzuki/Toyota taken care of this fact especially in country like India then the issue would never have had cropped up. I believe the Suzuki has similar quality even in cars in Europe but those countries are much cooler.

977, drsachin , 23:19 ,BHPian,"Few Questions 1. My dealer Espirit noida was handing over spare headlight bulbs together with the vehicle while taking delivery to some of the buyers but it was not provided to me. On questioning i was told, Toyota provides spare bulbs for variants with halogen Projectors and not LED projectors. Just wanted to confirm this fact from others. 2. Regarding vehicle operations. What's the ideal practice for idlling at redlights? With automatics the best practice I believe is to put on N with parking brake. But as per the online manual the hybrid battery doesn't charge if put on N mode. So this can potentially discharge hybrid battery completely with AC on. 3. I had been activating Android Auto voice search for various functions such as GMAPS and music search through the app itself on the touch panel. Sometimes the Android auto suggests me to use the voice search button on the steering wheel itself. But i couldn't find a way to associate the voice search button on steering wheel with Android auto, it instead activates voice search of the Touch screen and not Android auto. Did anyone find a way to associate Android Auto voice search through steering mounted control?. 4. While receiving calls through the steering mounted controls. I have to pull the call button twice or sometimes thrice. Is it the same with everyone or mine is broken?.", 24th February 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,Ghaziabad,134,409

979, Sricar , 15:23 ,BANNED,"Hyryder or Seltos Looking to upgrade from Grand i10. Budget around 16 lakhs OTR. Went to Lanson Toyoto showroom on ECR today to enquire about the S AT Neodrive variant.Being a Sunday only one sales person was available.No crowd. But the S variant was not there.Only a G variant was available in cave black colour. Me and wife liked the vehicle.Being on the wrong side of 60,the automatic being a torque converter appealed to me the most.The next thing I wanted to check was the back seat comfort.One major complaint in this vehicle I often hear on social media and wad in TeamBHP is the back seat head room. I am a tad above 5'10"" and in shoes I am stand nearly 6 feet.But I found the head room very adequate.The back seat did not give us any claustrophobic effect.The interior in the front was passable.Not able to avoid the feel that we were inside a Maruti.Driver side switches could have been really improved.Bonnet was clearly visible from the driver seat.Boot space was decent.It was obvious that the front doors were stronger than the back ones.A few taps on both the doors will make you aware of this.Realky don't know why these sort of compromises are being made by the manufacturers. I asked about adding alloys, changing the halogen to LED,fixing a 360 degree camera and changing to a bigger display.He advised not to go for a bigger display and the OEM one is adequate.Other things he readily agreed and quoted the below prices. 1.Alloys-16k/per wheel(I felt this was on a higher side) 2.Changing to LED headlights-10k. 3.360 degree camera-20 to 25k.(Does this cost this much in after market too?) 4.Bigger display-25 to 35k.(whew!). Waiting period quoted was 3 to 5 months. May test drive it in a few days. Then we visited Capital Kia in Adyar.Wanted to have a look at the HTk Plus IMT variant. In this vehicle I felt the roof being nearer to my head from the driving position.This is the second time I am having a look at the Seltos.We felt the room for 3 persons was slightly more than the Hyryder.But here the sales person said they won't change the halogen to LED and said the OEM headlights are enough.But in the market report the biggest complaint is the inadequate light throw in the HTk variant.The vehicle already has alloy wheels. Both the vehicles will have good road presence. When comparing the above vehicles in these particular variants these are the points to be noted. Hyryder. 17 inch wheels(But no alloys). Safety rating is expected to be at least 4 stars. Torque Converter Auto. Being an hybrid,will give more mileage than Seltos. GC is 210mm. All disc brakes. Dealer says a few accessories can be upgraded at the showroom itself. Wearing Toyota badge.(Though its a Maruti in disguise ) Default warranty for 3 years or one lakh kms. Extended Warranty for 31k-5 years or 2 lakh kms. From third service,we have to shell out 4 to 5 k. Seltos HTk Plus IMT. Alloy wheel(R16 compared to R17in UC.) 6 air bags.(Only two in UC) Sun Roof(Not in UC) All disc brakes. Bigger display. Being an IMT, more control? Can wait for the arrival of facelift this year. Default warranty-3 years with unlimited kms. I read a lot that this has an unstable shell.(Told by GNCAP?).That's a concern. Having said that,I am a sedate driver and most of my driving will be within Chennai.Even on highway I may not reach more than 90. I am leaving India by April and will be back only in September. I want to part with my much loved Grand i10 before leaving. So when I come back I can't afgord to wait to get a car home.Given up two wheeler riding and a vehicle is must in the household.So before leaving i want to book a car,so that I can take delivery once I come back. It is going to be a toss up between the above two.Will be immensely great full for any suggestions between the above two or any other car.Mostly this may be the last car I may be buying. Wanted go for either Kushaq or VW Virtus.(Seeing great reviews for Virtus).Kushaq AT is beyond my budget.As far as Virtus is concerned ingress and egress is a major concern for a person like me,who isn't getting any younger.

Alloys are definitely expensive, should not be more than 10-12k outside. Being a maruti base, alloys should be easily available in the market. 360 camera is a tricky part. I did my market research before buying my Hyryder. Blockbuster bbt601 6GB , 128GB storage 9inch display with 360 camera is available in Delhi karol bagh for around 30K+ Additional 2.5K for fitment. I am a little surprised that the dealer offered 360 camera which is not available as official accessory with Hyryder/GV , so in all possibility he is offering an aftermarket camera only. In the aftermarket 360 camera alone is also available at some places(12-15k) but it's more of a Jugaad thing. Integrating this 360 camera with OEM system is difficult and controlling various camera angles is also tricky. Toyota/Maruti are also not providing the OEM 9inch display ( Used in G/V variant) as a separate accessory so if you upgrade 9inch , in most probability the dealer is offering an aftermarket display only. Now regarding Seltos vs Grand Vitara/Hyryder The only area where I feel Seltos is ahead is slightly more powerful engine and better build quality. TC gearbox from Aisin is way ahead of iMT which is not a proper automatic. Manual control is present even in TC using paddle shifters. Regarding safety i always consider crash testing rating and structural stability ahead of Airbags. Kia is providing 6 Airbags in almost all cars since it know all it's cars have failed crash worthiness so using a psychological fix that it's cars now comes with 6 Airbags. Hyryder suspension is way ahead of Seltos. Sunroof only has novelty factor specially in India.", 27th February 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,Ghaziabad,134,409

I have shared the report here- https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/offic...ml#post5427753 (Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder Review) Yesterday we had a Duster owners meet at the same place and managed to test my Duster AWD over there. This was my take after driving the Hyryder- Quote: Originally Posted by Samba In the video below, the obstacle was crossed with the ESP on & 4wd lock. The Duster AWD can cross this at a slower pace due to it's short gearing and better low-end torque. Attaching the video, where I have put the performance of both the cars back to back- Both were driven with 4wd lock & ESp on & as I said earlier, the Duster could be driven at a much slower pace due to it's shorter 1st gear and much better low end torque from the diesel engine. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM7kLCW33oY The articulation of both the cars are similar. It will be difficult to say which will fare better. But if we consider the approach angle, break-over angle and the departure angle, Duster should score better. The proper skid-plates of the Duster do help. At the end of the day, my conclusion is, if anyone is looking to buy the Hyryder or the Grand Vitara for touring, do consider the AWD, it definitely helps in slush and snow. That is what one will encounter most during touring. Bad roads can be tackled by any car having a good ground clearance.

This sound was present even on normal road, not just bad roads. It was very irritating specially when car was in EV mode. I reported the same to the service centre Espirit Toyota Noida during first 1000km service. They immediately acknowledged the noise, and on test drive isolated left B pillar to be the source of noise. They removed the entire seat belt assembly, adjusted few bolts, and applied greese. But even then sound persisted. Later they requested the car to be kept overnight at the service centre. Next morning I got the call that the noise has been fixed. I went to the service center in the evening and did test drive, the noise was indeed gone. As per the service centre the noise was indeed from B pillar only. Few days later I could still hear some creaky sounds but it's very faint and only at bad roads also the source seem to be different now. Will report again during next 5000km service.

1022, tjsi , 21:21 ,BHPian,"I modified my pulse and glide technique to finally get a mileage of 27km/L. With AC on of course. Pulse up to desired speed and let go of the throttle to deactivate engine and get the ECO bar up to 2 dots to activate the motor. Letting go of gas especially on down slopes helps with regen. The problem I'm now facing is that on speeds like 60 to 80 the car will not maintain the constant speed while on battery with 2 dots on the ECO. It needs at least 4 to maintain the constant speed. It rarely ever drives on battery after 2 dots. It can very well handle it because I've seen it do it a few times. Even cruise control turns on the engine more often and isn't as eco-friendly as using it in my Honda City. I feel like Toyota should update the firmware to optimize the hybrid system to maximise handling of the initial acceleration and maintaining constant speed by the battery more often and have a higher threshold where the engine activates. Which one should I believe? Last fill up showed 26.2Km/L using the fill up formula but ODO showed 25.6. Currently my remaining fuel is 6 dots. Another thing that I wanted to mention is that after driving this car for so long I completely forgot what pure power feels like. I drove my Honda City after so long that a little tap on the accelerator sent it flying. Drove the Fortuner right after and man... Hyryder's no fun to drive unless it's on power mode. The Power mode on the Hyryder feels straight out of their motor sports division. I kept up with a quick BMW X1 driver this morning. All that while still getting 31Km/For the trip . We had fun.

1036, pratiksinhal , 23:51 ,BHPian,"I am sharing my experience of owning the Hyryder. I have driven it for almost 1500 kms. Pros: 1. Fuel Efficiency. Its probably the one major reason why everyone should look at this vehicle. 2. Hybrid Technology. Toyota being pioneer in this technology it was a no brainer to go for the Hyryder. 3. Comfortable seating position. Its very comfortable in the front as well as the rear. 4. Toyota reliability. Being a toyota user for more than 2 decades we were sure about it will be a hassle free experience . Cons : 1. Interior Quality : Rattling has already started. It feels like a Maruti more than a Toyota. The rear parcel tray has started making so much noise. I have removed it and now the rear rattling sound is not there. There was noise from the co-drivers seat which was resolved by the service Center. 2. Idling Noise: this is the most frustrating part about the hybrid experience. When the battery is on 1 bar and the engine takes over in traffic jams , the engine vibration is very high. You can feel it very easily on your feet if you are driving and also in the front seat. I think toyota should find a solution soon. 3. Basic small issues : After a drive when I turn the car off the door locks dont open by itself . I need to manually unlock it . (If someone has changed this setting it would be great if you could help.) The window switches feel like from an entry level Maruti. For a 22 lakh on road car it doesnt feel good. 4. Basic Audio quality : I have a nexon and a creta. The music quality is below par in the Hyryder. Nexon with Harman and Creta with Bose are leagues ahead. 5. Build Quality : A 2-wheeler came and kissed the back of the car and there was a dent. The car had to go to the body shop for denting and painting. It reminded me of the build quality of the Nexon. There was an incident where an army gypsy had kissed the rear left number of the nexon and its head light broke, whereas there was a minor scratch on the nexon. The last Maruti vehicle that I had owned was a SX4 from 2007-2011. Prior to that I had a Swift. The main issue which kept me away from Maruti vehicles since 2011 were the interior built quality. Somehow because of lower quality of plastics used in them the rattling was always an issue. I have owned Toyota , Hyundai , Tata and Honda post my Maruti experience and even after more than 75000 on the odometer I have not experienced any kind of rattling noise. But , now with the Hyryder the Marutis quality has come back to haunt me . In the 45 days of ownership experience I can summarise that this is not the Toyota we are used to. The Maruti in Hyryder shows up very evidently every now and then. I feel Hybrid buyers should take a test drive of the Honda City to feel the difference . The interior quality and the hybrid quality is much better. The Honda dealership here didnt have a test drive vehicle so I opted out of it. I have been using the Creta for last 8 years (5 years 2015-2020 first gen, 3 years 2020-2023 the current gen) and in terms reliability is has been pretty good. For the same price point I feel the quality of the Korean twins and even the Vags are much ahead . I dont feel that assured with the Hyryder. It has been my personal experience .

Pick up is more than adequate for city ae well as highway. There was no trouble overtaking large trucks. However If you are expecting to win drag race please look elsewhere. 3. NVH levels - Its moderate to be honest and you hear the engine start because it dead silent when it runs on battery in between or when it starts rolling. 4. Drivability and brakes - The disc brakes have good bite and stops the car without any fuss or theatrics. Drivability is excellent. 5. HUD - I switched between Android and Apple Car play. Had no issues navigating and using maps. The GPS worked as intended. Speakers are again adequate esp when you are travelling with family and kids. If you want concert experience then this is not enough. 6. Looks - Its subjective. I like it. Since its new many asked what car is it? Cons: 1. Untraceable squeaky sound from windows, backseat etc. Time and again it reminds you of M*R*T* build quality (no offence intended). 2. I felt the steering is a bit on the heavier side in comparison to i10 or swift. 3. Sunroof shade - Boy what were they thinking, maybe its good for cold countries where they celebrate sunlight but in India it was a poor choice or simply they copied and pasted without considering our climate. With temperatures ~ 35 to 38 degrees on the outside I had to bring the AC to its lowest setting. Funny thing is the blower makes more sound than the engine 4. Boot space - You will need to remove the parcel tray when going for road trips with your family. Additional Note - During the second service Toyota have replaced rear seat belt mounting worth 4k for free due to ongoing recall. It was a 2 hours job.", 4th April 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,KOLKATA,177,425

""Using leaded petrol in a new car engine is not recommended as it can cause damage to the engine and other components. Leaded petrol contains a high level of lead, which is used as an additive to increase the fuel's octane rating and improve performance. However, lead can build up on the engine's spark plugs and valves, leading to poor engine performance, reduced fuel efficiency, and potentially serious damage to the engine. Newer cars are designed to run on unleaded petrol, which contains significantly less lead or no lead at all. Using leaded petrol in a new car can also cause damage to the car's catalytic converter, which is designed to reduce harmful emissions. Therefore, it is important to always use the type of fuel recommended by the car manufacturer to ensure optimal performance and avoid damage to the engine.""", 5th April 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,KOLKATA,177,425

Can anyone tell what is the % of ethanol in normal Indian oil vs XP95. The comment was made specifically in context of the Hyryder, whose manual clearly states that 1. Engine is tuned for 91 octane 2. If the user is not satisfied with performance and efficiency of higher ethanol blends, he should revert to back E10. Contrast this to something like the Skoda Kushaq, where it is clearly stated that the engine is tuned for 95 octane, but needs 91 octane minimum. Cars like this one actually benefit from 95 octane. An engine tuned for 91 octane does not benefit from running 95 octane, all other things being constant. Here, the difference is that XP95 is E10, while normal petrol is E12 or E15. Ethanol’s calorific value is a third less than that of pure petrol. Higher the amount of ethanol blended in, lower the net calorific value of the fuel. And the effect of this is directly felt in terms of reduced performance, reduced responsiveness as well as increased fuel consumption. This is what is the OP was feeling. Also, fuel bunks and depots are having issues with water contamination in tanks with these E blends.

The waiting period for the 'Neo Drive' variants is said to be around 7 months, while customers of the hybrid variants will have to wait for up to 20 months from the day of booking. The Urban Cruiser Hyryder shares its underpinnings with the Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara. It is available with a 1.5-litre mild-hybrid and a 1.5-litre strong-hybrid powertrain that makes 91 BHP and 122 Nm. The ICE is paired with an electric motor that has an output of 78 BHP and 141 Nm. The Innova Crysta and Innova Hycross are also said to have a long waiting period. Customers of the Innova Crysta will have to wait around 16 weeks for delivery, while those opting for the Hycross can expect deliveries only after 26 months.

Average drive is 1500 Kms per month with weekly drive Mum-Pune-Mum with my office being in Mumbai and residence in Pune. Average I get is 23.5-23.60 kmpl with a mix of 60% highway/40% city drive. Quite happy with the number as my city drive is average of 6 kmph. No issues faced with the car. Slight creak with the dashboard. Engine noise at idle continues to irk. I consider that I am driving a diesel car and not a petrol car. Feel it more after driving an Yaris I use HP Power/ BPCL Speed in the car. Has smoothened the drive as compared to normal fuel. Never fill on IOC bunks as they always return a lower mileage. BPCL is the best. I feel the LED lights are weak and miss fog lamps. Unfortunately cannot upgrade as the entire light is sealed. Handling in the ghats and highway is very good. Car doesn't bounce as much and the body roll is very well controlled.

It's strange the motors don't compensate for the CVTs rubberband effect. I own a hybrid and do agree to your point. Hybrid cars in general hates hard acceleration, the generators in the e-CVT have to spin up really fast to reach direct drive rpm, by which the engine will directly engage in driving the car. So when you floor the acc. it takes time to get up to the D.D speed. On normal acceleration (keeping the power band in the eco-green zone) there is no typical CVT rubber band effect.

I have done Mumbai-Lonavala return ride in hyryder hybrid and I got 24.6kmpl tank-tank, while MID showed 25.3kmpl, not much difference. speed on expressway being under 100 as lot of cameras. This 24.6kmpl includes ride up till tiger point and didn't feel any power issue any where (i am coming from Ecosport dragon petrol engine). The return from top was only on battery as the regen handled most of the thing. Another trip was Mumbai-Shirdi-Shani Shignapur return and got 26.2kmpl tank-tank. Speed was between 90-105kmph depending on the available stretch and also using cruise control at 98kmph. What i have found is if the driver knows how to drive a hybrid car, they can easily pull good efficiency while not cutting out on speed.", 19th May 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,mumbai,59,71

When I mentioned 140kmph I actually should have said 120kmph which is the speed limit. But it was too late when I try to edit it. Also what I implied was that the speed goes up and down and not just below 90 kmph consciously.

1120, Cruzn , 18:06 ,BHPian,"So I went on my first “long” trip since I got my Hyrdyer in Feb. While overall, there weren’t any issues, it didn’t start off too well. 1. As soon as I hit the open road, I switched to Power mode, just to get the hang of it. When I came to a stop at the toll, a few metres ahead, another driver told me that my exhaust was leaking. I pulled over and noticed that there were a few droplets and figured that maybe I should stick to Eco mode. Just when I continued my trip, I saw a Hyryder rip past me and noticed their exhaust leaking like crazy! Is this something I need to worry about? Should I get this checked? 2. The other thing I noticed was when I hit speeds of 80 and above, the steering got incredibly stiff. I never noticed this with my other rides but is this normal? Has anyone else encountered any of these issues? Are these even considered “issues”?", 30th May 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,64,250

1123, aks812 , 09:26 ,BHPian,"So i finally had a long trip in my Hyryder Hybrid G last week, the route was Mumbai - Bhopal - Pench and return. The trip was approximately 2600km in 8 days and in this also completed 5000km. Few observations from the trip below - 1. The roads were mostly good, specially the highways in MP were amazing. Drove mostly in normal mode, tried eco mode in between but it would reduce the AC performance so kept mostly in normal mode and power mode in between on ghats and overtakes. Didn't feel any issue on performance. 2. Compared to my Seltos IVT, there is hardly any lag in acceleration but yes the engine is more noisy when pushed in normal or eco mode. 3. The sunroof is a big issue with the mosquito net throwing lot of heat inside, i tried putting the side sun shades on the roof while going from Mumbai to Bhopal and kept the AC at auto for 24, as i usualy do, but the blower was always on full blast. The sun shade protection didn't help much as lot of area remained open to heat, picture attached. On reaching Bhopal i placed a thermocol sheet above the sunroof cover so now i had sun shade cover and thermocol cover to protect from the heat. 3. Sound quality is decent if you play around with audio settings and at par with Seltos. 4. The ride quality is the best i have experienced, coming from Ecosport and Seltos. It is not stiff like Ecosport and Seltos, takes all the rumble strips and the small continuous speed breakers in its stride without any noise and rattling inside the cabin. The steering weighs up perfectly over high speed, when compared to Seltos which remains light even post 110kmph. 5. The stock Apollo Apterra Cross tyres feel decent, better than Goodyears which came on Seltos and Ecosport. They do have some road noise, not as silent as Michelin. But had an incident where to save a dog i had to brake hard at speed of 80-90 and the stopping distance was disappointing. I have external tmps installed which helped with tyre pressure and temperature, i feel its must have for all cars. 6. Storage was not a problem with medium sized bags and little adjustment in the boot. 7. LED headlight throw feels more than adequate to me, compared to Seltos LED headlights. 8. We were 2-3 people and about 4-5 medium sized bags on the trip. Got the below mentioned mileage, tank to tank method, though mileage displayed on MID was very close to actual. a. Mumbai to Bhopal - 24.89kmpl. This was with sun shade only on top, AC set on 24 and blower going full blast. Speed was between 80-90, occasionally going 110+. b. Bhopal to Pench - 25.1 kmpl This time i had a thermocol sheet placed in top and there was no heat coming inside from sunroof. Speed was between 80-90, didn't cross 100 here. c. Pench to Bhopal - 23.6kmpl Thanks to the good roads from Pench - Lakhnadon - Narsinghpur, drove only in power mode to have fun. d. Bhopal to Mumbai - 26.2kmpl Tried keeping the car in EV mode as much as possible by modulating the accelerator. I have always filled XP95 from the start, not sure if that is helping in getting more mileage. Only negative i found was the cheap sunroof cover, need to install a good CR20 roof tint over the weekend.

Quote: I purchased a Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder G variant. Initially, I was delighted with my choice, as I have always held Toyota vehicles in high regard for their reliability and quality. However, since taking ownership, I have experienced numerous significant issues with my car. They greatly affected my driving experience and, more importantly, my confidence in the vehicle. The problems I have encountered to date resulted in the replacement of the Transaxle within 2 months. I must emphasize that my intention is not to discredit the Toyota brand, which I have previously held in high regard. However, the severity and frequency of the problems I am experiencing with this particular vehicle led me to believe that it may be an isolated case of manufacturing or assembly defects. I am not satisfied with the car's performance and that has caused significant inconvenience, agony and frustration. In light of these circumstances, I requested my dealer to initiate the necessary steps to replace my defective vehicle with a new one that meets the high standards of quality and reliability that Toyota is known for. However, it's still under research while they are collecting data and sharing it with TKM to find out the solution. I also heard from the dealer that it's the first defective car in India. As a customer, I am suffering a lot. I am really confused about what to do at this stage and thought of contacting you for your kind valuable suggestions and advice.

From the time of delivery until my first service at 1000 kms, I was able to maintain a mileage of 28.6. This was all done within the city with the AC on at least 90% of the time. I have now completed almost 4000 kms and my mileage is at 25 with my AC on less than 40% of the time (I have been literally sweating it out just to get my mileage up ). It was at 24.8 for the longest time and I just managed to get it up in the last couple of weeks. My driving has been the same. My routes are the same. The number of passengers (and their weights ) have been the same. Even the petrol bunk I fill up at has been the same. And this is all on Eco mode. I have tested Power mode for less than 5 seconds so far. I have made a couple of long trips (not more than 110 km one way) and I am still unable to figure out the reason for the drop in mileage. The only difference I see are the weather conditions. Bangalore was a lot cooler in March (when my first service was due) than it is now. Could the heat be the reason for this drop? Did something happen during the first service that has contributed to this change? Anyone else experiencing the same?

And i drive between 50- 80Km/H for about 40kms one way so total 80kms a day. Lowest i ever got was 21.9 in the most horrid Delhi jams and rains all week long. I normally get 25-26 with AC on and just switching between power modes. I keep it on normal mode mostly as ECO mode reduces AC performance. I refill every time I reach 3 bars of fuel (about 10-12 days) Ground clearance has been god sent post rains. Didn't scratch once down there even in unavoidable deepest pits of hell of Gurgaon and Delhi. Suspension is super comfortable so far. Build quality has been satisfactory. The service center has helped a lot by installing those NVH kits and eliminated all random noises from the cabin. NVH levels are great. I only hear the Generator if it's running while the car is moving at low speeds. It shuts up and it's all silent again. It also depends on the quality of the road. There's one section where the road noise is virtually zero. Other times it's good enough to be with my thoughts or drown the rest of it with music on 6-8 volume. Power train is silent and can't tell when it switches between battery and engine. Transmission is also amazing. No jerks and very controlled and well calibrated at low speeds. It is important to let go of the accelerator in a hybrid car and I can't emphasize on it enough. The less you break, the more you get rewarded. Let it roll to a stop before red lights and approaching speed breakers. Let go of accelerator to maintain a safe distance from the car ahead. Let go of the accelerator on down hills and flyovers. I've been doing this and I manage to charge the battery up to 3-4 bars and get trip mileages of 27-28km/L. The issues and concerns of ""mosquito net"" film are absolutely invalid. I've only ever seen such complaints from owners with a darker color car, which absorbs more light and traps more heat. I was never once bothered with any sunlight or shadows getting through, in fact the cabin is well lit to not be distracting and dark enough to maintain privacy and temperature, thanks to the green tinted glasses. It doesn't get hotter than any other car parked directly under the sun for 7 hours a day, and when it does get hot in 40°C+ days, the AC is good enough to quickly cool it down in 5-10 minutes on just 1st or 2nd fan speed. I keep it at 24-26°C. Ventilated seat is also turned on while coming back home around 4pm. TPMS, 360° camera and ventilated seats have been life saving and priceless features for me. Sound system is great. I just feel that the highs could be a little more clearer if you were to increase the bass. I played around with its settings and my Rock and pop music have been quite nice to listen to. Biggest concern is with back seats as I feel they're too upright and they could've reclined them more. Headroom has had no complaints. Wipers are not good. They made a lot of sound since day 1 and i had them fixed up a bit on my 10k service. They leave streaks behind most of the times. Headlights are good at night and in remote areas with no street lights I could see every thing with high beams. Side view mirrors are quite small. So I purchased those circular blind spot mirrors off amazon and they have been game changing. I installed one on top left corner of the right mirror with the ball joint it comes with and it has been my favorite mod. Merging on highways and switching lanes is not stressful and dangerous to me anymore. Rear view mirror could be a little more zoomed in. There was this issue where the sensor wasn't sensitive enough and would blind me with high beams. I later realized that the raised back seat headrest cast a shadow on the sensor causing it to not react to the bright light. Minor, but i really wish it came with the Blue Toyota logo that they have on their higher end hybrid cars. Anyone have a link for a sticker? It's a great car and an amazing package overall. There are bigger cars available in the same price range, but would i choose them over the Hyryder? Absolutely not.", 6th August 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,New,68,436

1177, OpenRoads , 19:15 ,BHPian,"First time puncture with my Hyryder Its almost a year (9079 KM) since I have been driving around in this car. Now coming to the actual issue, the puncture happened in phases. First time I realized something was wrong was when the dashboard showed a yellow triangular icon with an exclamation mark inside. I knew something was wrong but never had seen such a icon glow before. I googled and found that its due to low tyre pressure. So I switched on/started the car (push button instead of a key sometimes feels like lighting a bulb instead :P) and drove it around a bit to see which one is causing the issue in the TPMS. I proudly used portable tyre inflator (purchased for long trips and carrying it in the boot since beginning) to bring it to normal level. However since the deviation was not very large I ruled out the possibility of a puncture. Second time I was returning from a trip and noticed the same icon glow again. This time the pressure was lower and the TPMS was showing the tyre blinking in red. Honestly I was both happy and concerned to see this feature. Never before I have seen a car tyre blink in a different colour than the rest on a dashboard. I parked the car and filled a little more than required pressure for the remaining trip. Back from the trip I forgot all about it (crazy stupid work can do wonders) and noticed it again when I took it out for a evening ride. Next day I took the car to nearby FIXO Puncture center and took care of the issue. The culprit were two long nails quite close to each other which had pierced the tyre. I got it repaired with rubber patches pasted within the inside walls which was pretty basic. But the part which caught my attention was when he removed the tyre and deflated it. TPMS was showing the fall in pressure level as is. I was not aware that the sensor is positioned somewhere inside the tyre and was battery operated connected by bluetooth or some other protocol. So when he removed the tyre from the wheel I was able to see the sensor. Pretty neat tech I will say since I never had the privilege to ride a car with so many sensors or indicators before as my previous car is a bare bones Hyundai i10 (2010) model which still accompanies me (1.3L KM) to market and tight spaces in my city ", 22nd August 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,KOLKATA,177,425

Don't want to look beyond Toyota, Suzuki (Maruti) and Honda and in that order. Panoramic sunroof is an absolute no for me and my family. For reference, my usage is 80% city and 20% highways. I currently own an Etios petrol 2013 - serving pretty well without any fuss, but due to my back problem (had a slip disk kind of event in May '23), I experienced radiating pain in my left leg - gone now. Hence, the need for an AT machine that sits a little high for easy ingress and egress. I have test driven all three a few times and appreciate the USP of each, but none turned out to the one that's just ""wow"" to freeze on. So, kind of in a fix which one to pick although Elevate will always be the last in my list (more as a fallback). Each has its own merits and demerits - don't want to elaborate. 1) I like the Hybrid for the peppy engine and eCVT in city driving plus the mileage it ekes out. Don't like the 3-cylinder engine's noise when pushed or rushed on open roads. With three price hikes since launch (15.11L + 50K+60K+25K), the value proposition seems gone. My annual run is 10k-12k. Price difference between Hybrid S and NeoDrive AT S is 3.25L OTR - not sure if fuel economy advantage will be enough to payback within the ownership period of say 8-10 years. 2) The NeoDrive is a very silent and reliable machine that gives decent mileage and power for a regular driver but runs out of gas on highways with car loaded. The AT avatar is quite slow in response in stop and go traffic. 3) The Honda Elevate is good at most of things but lacks anything distinctive. The CVT is fine in city driving but makes a lot of noise at high speed or when pushed. Well, i have not owned a city, but have driven extensively as we have one in our family. This Elevate does not give that feeling. Also, mileage in Elevate is not very encouraging in city driving. Further, as a 6-footer, i found the driving seat travel and under thigh support underwhelming. PS: There is 1 Hybrid Silver (i prefer White or Grey) S variant readily available in Bangalore, while NeoDrive and Elevate can be delivered in 2-3 months according to dealers.", 5th October 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,39,85

I am sure Hybrid would be the best you can buy. And you are lucky if you are getting ready delivery of S Variant. In Delhi NCR the delivery timelines of S- Hybrid variant are insane. I own Hyryder V-Hybrid and pretty happy with it. My driving requirements are pretty similar although I drive almost 15-18k kms every year but even if it had been 10-12k i would still have brought the same. Reasons. 1. In bumper to bumper traffic conditions the difference in mileage could be easily 1:3 or even more. 2. I always feel guilty when I don't switch off engine in traffic Jams/Red lights which are more than 30 seconds just to keep AC running. But with hybrid car no such issue. In hybrid the engine is off automatically most of the time at traffic lights , as the AC is supplied by hybrid battery. So you keep AC running and saving fuel too. 3. NVH levels are actually zero almost 50-60% of times when on EV mode and at City speeds it's only on highway at speeds more than 100kms/hr that you notice NVH. Infact with 5th generation DOHC city engine that is used in elevate sounds worse on highway speeds. 4. Hybrid automatic is one of the best gearbox which you enjoy in city traffic. It's not Jerky like DCT. There is no rubber band effect as seen in a conventional CVT. There is no drop in power output or efficiency as seen in a Torque converter infact there is power boost thanks to electric boost from the battery. 5. Toyota service is the best available for the segment across all manufacturers I took test drives of almost all automatic cars for almost a year in the price bracket of 10lakh to 20lakh before finalizing Hyryder. Only Honda city hybrid appeared better but it's suspension and steering was no match for Hyryder.

I would recommend one that has a front and rear camera as well as is equipped with the parking monitoring kit (separately ordered at around 1500) and get it fitted (costs 1200 to fit). Just a front one and which works only when you are driving (with no monitoring when your car is parked) may not get you the protection that you may like.", 14th October 2023,toyota-urban-cruiser,Bangalore,411,409

1250, Maverick Avi , 20:30 ,BHPian,"A relative of mine just got home a top end Toyota Hyryder hybrid and I took it for a short spin. I usually drive a Wagon R 1.2 AMT these days in Delhi and my observations are more or less based on that. - As soon as I sat in the driver sear I found my head touching the roof. Got the seat height down and it was better. Overall frontal visibility was fine when seat height was up but not when it was reduced. Cabin didn't feel as airy as the Wagon R and overall visibility was also not as good. - While my relative was reversing the car out from garage I could hear the car whine and grine a lot. Didn't sound like a silent electric motor. - Window switches and ORVM control panel was same as my Wagon R. Was not expecting in a 20lakh rupee car. - Space was just ok. Was expecting more from a ""Grand"" Vitara's twin. - The gear lever was hard and rigid. Also didn't give a good feel of slotting. I was just not able to figure out whether it has slotted into P, R, D or N unless I kept a watch on the info display. Very unlike my AMT which is very sure slotting and require almost no effort. I have not driven much TQs, CVTs or DCTs except for test drives so not aware how their lever's behave. - The drive of EVT is buttery smooth!!! Zero gear changes are felt and the transition from electric to ICE is not felt at all. Infact there is no change of sound also when these transitions happen. This is an area the car just shines!!! - NVH is not great. Despite of car being driven in electric mode for most of my drive there is this constant whine. Much better than than my Wagon R though. Not like a Hyundai or Ford. - The top up display is not neat. Looks crude with the big hole. - Ride was slightly boucy and I guess it was due to over inflated tyres. Inquired from relative and he had not got the air pressure checked since taking delivery a week back. - Could already notice a squeak from front dashboard while going over uneven surfaces. Overall, I didn't come back much impressed keeping in mind that this machine costs 20 lakhs on road(but I guess that's the premium we'll have to pay for the sweet and seamless hybrid technology). For daily commutes this can be a no nonsense car with added advantage of saving on petrol costs.

This is going to be a fun explanation Toyota has posted a video 8 month ago on how to put your hybrid car in maintenance mode during PUC. Its a sequence which would put tomb rider and national treasure script writers to shame. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iljxgpj0F74 However in my case this was not enough. The PUCs I visited were not able to capture 2500rpm using their sensor which is needed as per their explanation. On the other hand the On-board diagnostics (OBD) connected with data link connector (DLC) was showing 2500 rpm on the laptop screen at Toyota service center. Bottomline was there is a considerable difference between the data read through DLC and external sensors used at the PUCs for rpm measuring. And this prohibited me from getting a PUC certificate. I ended up finding a PUC center which didn't even bother to pop the hood and got me the certificate. According to this PUC the rpm measurement is only for Diesel cars. I am interested to know if this is even correct. In case your car is revving more than 2500 rpm in maintenance mode let me know. In the mean time I am sure Hyryder/GV customers might need to visit the center more than once to get this resolved. Hope this piece of info helps you in advance.

It has been exactly a month since we've brought home our Toyota Hyryder, and incidentally, today was the first time the car has been tanked up since the last full tank was on the day of delivery on 30th November, 2022. Variant: Hybrid G Quote: Originally Posted by S2!!! The Hyryder proved its mettle on a recent Mumbai-Nashik-Mumbai drive, with 4 passengers on board. Some key observations: So this time, I'll just get to the numbers instead. Tank full to tank full fuel efficiency: Best: 26.5kpl (80% highway + 20% city) Worst: 18.5kpl (100% city) Average: 21.1kpl Observations: Even though my car is driven in Eco mode at all times, ambient temperatures and climate control setting have a huge impact on fuel efficiency. As explained by someone from the product team, the e-compressor exerts tremendous load on the Li-Ion battery, which in turn relies on the engine (generator) to recharge it, thus impacting fuel consumption. When climate control is set to 22 deg C or below, fuel efficiency drops below 20kpl (with ambient temperatures above 30 deg C). 23 deg C and higher is a relatively economical setting, however to cool down a sun-baked cabin does load up the e-compressor initially. So, short drives will be very inefficient with figures falling to single digits occasionally; only once the car is cool, does the FE improve and from thereon the numbers rise above the 20kpl mark. Expenses: Rs 3,200 - prepaid maintenance package (Smiles Package), opted for at the time of purchase, which covered all service+labour costs up to the 10,000km service. Rs 2,200 - got wheel alignment and balancing done at the service centre itself. Rs 22,400 - Zero Dep insurance renewal (didn't have No Claim Bonus) Faults: Occasional creaking sound around the gear lever area. Wireless charging pad suspends charging if the phone moves even half a centimeter. Making/receiving calls via Wireless Android Auto is a hit or a miss. Sometimes after the first 5 seconds neither party can hear anything. This isn't a network related issue! Verdict: These minor niggles aside, the car is fantastic. I like how it looks. The interiors feel reasonably upmarket and space for four is decent. Its hybrid powertrain is its biggest strength not only for its fuel efficiency but also for its super responsiveness, which makes overtaking trailers and trucks a breeze. I also like how the suspension feels - tough over bad roads and confident on the highway. Moreover, this is a fill it, shut it and forget it type of car which does what's expected of it rather well.

I agree that the difference between Eco/Normal mode is mainly due to the AC and I have seen varying figures as well. Try to keep car in Eco mode at all times, except highway drives with full load. I recently completed a 1200 kms road trip which was a good mix of highway, ghats, city drives. With four people and a full boot load car managed to return 22 kpl, effectively costing me Rs.4.80/km which I think is really good. The highway drives were OK but car screams in the ghats especially in the kokan region where the gradient is high with many hair pin bends. Issues faced Creaking sound near gear area - culprit - the two side covers which rise up to the dash Squeaking from dash board which no one is able to diagnose Rattling of passenger seat at a particular angle when empty.

On highway with cruising speed of 80~100kmph you will get 20~23 kmpl since the petrol engine is at work more often. but still impressive in comparison with other cars with 1.5l engines. Overall Hyryder is a very practical no nonsense car. If you drive it sensibly you can easily get an average of 20+ and if not then its a easy 15. Now a word of caution - 1. The whole car is Maruti Suzuki built except the engine and transmission (Toyota) and airbags (sourced from different vendor). Hence it is not at all at par with its German or Korean counterparts in terms of fit and finish like switches, seats, dashboard etc. Its good but not something comparable with top trims (I mean any 20lakh car). 2. In case you are sitting for an hour in parking mode enjoying AC without driving it will give you a mileage of 8~9kmpl. The whole hybrid charging happens when the car is moving not stand still. In parking mode the engine starts automatically to keep the battery above 2 bars. And there is no charging due to traction which is the beauty of the car. If you have 2023 Seltos 1.5 DCT Turbo then switching it just for mileage is just bizarre and doesn't make any sense unless you really need a 2nd car. Hope this helps you to make the right decision.

1280, tjsi , 08:03 ,BHPian,"Its been a long time since i updated on the car. Done 20,000kms and now due for the 4th service. Final verdict from my side: 1. The car is a pleasure to drive. I had previously complained heavily about ticks and rattles and they're all gone after Toyota installed NVH kits free of cost. The car drives silent with minimal road noise. My City CVT petrol now feel like a diesel tractor compared to it. 2. Mileage has improved a lot and I'm averaging 26-28 tank to tank on my 40km one way commute, driving at 60-80km/hr and also getting stuck in nonsense traffic. In Delhi its the time of the year when you can't decide if you need the fans/ac or not. I don't need anything on the morning so I drive the 40kms and was able to get a lot of mileage out of it. I do need the AC in the evening but that doesn't affect the mileage a lot but it increases the threshold of when the engine turns on. Your trip mileage doesn't matter, your tank to tank does. There were heavy rains thus traffic between September so that's why I got the lowest ever mileage of 21.9. I belive that It's almost impossible to get less than 20 if you drive a decent amount. 3. No, the sunroof did not bother me all year. Even if I felt that the car was hot, the AC performance fixed it right away. It's huge and I love it. 4. I sometimes feel like changing the tyres. I feel like they could be a bit more silent and grippier. For Mud and Snow tyres they have average performance in Mud. 5. Sound system is great. 6. Back seats have complaints from my family that they're not as spacious and comfortable as the honda city and I agree. It's not as good of an experience. I would want another level of recline Also the AC vents back there are unidirectional. Headroom never got any complaints. 7. Android auto has been bothering a lot. There are some locations where android will absolutely crash no matter what. Also the device sometimes would not connect as if it's forgotten that it was ever connected. Maybe a Google issue but I highly suspect the infotainment system because it started happening only 2 months ago. 8. Headlight performance is satisfactory. Have driven in pitch darkness. Didn't illuminate the road like a second sun but was able to safely avoid dogs and cows on the road. 9. The suspension is comfortable and stable at all speeds. That's all. 10. Getting the V model was the best decision I ever made. TPMS and 360° Cam saved me countless times, ventilated seats were a blessing after a long day.

1285, padmrajravi , 17:54 ,Senior - BHPian,"Took a test drive of Hyryder Hybrid and the Grand Vitara Smart Hybrid yesterday. Hyryder Neodrive was not available at dealership. The car was for my wife's brother. We were looking for the G variant, but was confused about whether to go for Neodrive or Hybrid. While driving the hybrid, the motor's whine was very evident whenever the car was in EV mode. The engine whenever it came up was more audible than the Neodrive variant. The mileage aspect is very tempting though. The hybrid variant is 3 lakhs more expensive than the Neodrive variant on road Kerala. It comes down to about 4k in extra EMI. I tried a rough calculation of the extra petrol cost for Neodrive assuming 1800 kms per month and that came down to 4K extra as well as per claimed numbers of both cars. I assumed a 6KMPL difference for hybrid. So it is about paying an extra 4K in EMI or extra 4K for petrol. Considering petrol prices will only go up and EMI will stay constant, I guess the hybrid wins. But I am doubtful whether that kind of mileage difference exists in real life. Came back to check the latest brochure from Toyota website and was pleasantly surprised to see 6 airbags in S variant for hybrid now. The G Neodrive and S hybrid has just a lakh of difference on road kerala. If one is not very particular about features, S is a tempting proposition now.

I had few rattling issues inside and had taken videos of the same as proof because lot of times the same issues dont appear during test drives with the service advisers but luckily both the rattling noise came up during the test drive. 1. Rattling from the gear lever panel. The SA said he was aware of this issue as it was reported in multiple Hyryders they had got and informed they have got the NVH kit from TKM which would solve the problem and no rattling now from the gear level area. 2. Rattling from the driver door. This rattling started in last few weeks, more during higher speeds. The noise appeared during the test drive at the backroad on bit of high speed and this is something they agreed to have heard for the first time. Later in the evening the SA informed that everything was done except the rattling from the driver door and still checking on it. Eventually he informed that the door winder is the culprit and they have already asked for a new part to be changed under warranty. Two days later the part came and was changed in 1 hour, costing around 600rs as per SA but free for me under warranty.

Now, after quite a wait; the dealer has one midnight black available which I can get (Parents are repeat customers at this Toyota, so there was goodwill for allotment).

1325, sriny_blr , 21:45 ,BHPian,"Swift to Hy(brid)Ryder; Almost all of the comparison of my Hyryder would be to my previously owned Swift 2014 ZDI. Swift had clocked close to 1.2lac kms before I decided to trade. Cars I took Test drive include Sonet, Nexon EV, S-cross, XL6, ScorpioN. Booking  had booked ScorpioN Z4 (4x4) variant on the launch day in July 2022. Did not get any Introductory price. My booking was in the wait listed since it was not a top variant. Even after 4 months the online status online showed the expected delivery as July 2024 Now the news came that Toyota announced the launch of Hyryder, booked the Hybrid S variant even without a test drive nor seeing the vehicle in person. I was happy with what the features it offered on that leaflet I felt it was a good upgrade for my swift. Fast forward - I took delivery of HyRyder (White) on 6th February 2023. My missus was not very convinced with getting a 5 seater, as she wanted a 7Seater. I also cancelled my booking of ScorpioN and got refund after 10% deduction. Jotting down my views in comparison to cars I own/owned. The best part;  Provides a very comfortable ride for 5. It is made for Indian (Bangalore pot holes) roads.  Getting a mileage of 22 ~ 23 KMPL (40% city and 60% highway) with highway speed ranging 80-110 KMPH, NO cruise control and in ECO mode. Heck the HyRyder gives my Suzuki shogun (2 stroke 93 model) run for money in mileage front.  Very spacious especially rear bench. All my folks are happy with good leg and shoulder room.  High GC much needed for our Free Size speed breakers and Surprise Pot Holes  Happy with the Headlights, was not Happy driving SWIFT during night in STOCK head light.  Music system starts almost instantly as soon as I switch ON and Connectivity on Android Auto is excellent and have no complaints though Im still unable to make calls using Voice command and I dont think the Toyota and Google are in sync yet for this.  Fancy lights below dash board near the ABC pedals (also provide for co-pilot). For whatever this is provided but a feel good factor.  Power windows button though looks same as SWFIT, the operation is very smooth in HyRyder. Thank goodness the door doesnt vibrate when windows roll up/down unlike my SWIFT. Things I need to be aware  Turning radius (U-turn) is higher and competes with my MM550.  NVH is good (at least inside). When engine kicks in, when outside sound seems slightly higher that other petrol cars.  During hard braking, people in rear bench tend to notice more (read scared) in HyRyder as compared to Swift. Issues noted  System showed an Alarm once RDS Interruption went away after some time on its own.  There was a vibration noise occasionally in front of cabin finally found the culprit to be IRVM. It does vibrate sometimes and makes an irritating noise but not always. Took it to service centre once he tried all sort of driving and didnt vibrate at all to my bad luck. Even now it does make irritating noise and there are no screws to adjust/tighten.  There is a kind of squeaking noise coming from the back left (boot area) when driving over pot holes or few speed breakers. Got it fixed by SC.  Changing gears (P-R-N-D-B) is hard/rough and you get a feeling like you are Forcing it to change rather than a smooth shift. Things I wish it had;  Adjusting time delay for intermittent wipers. My first car, a preowned 2005 Getz-GVS had this feature, nether Swift in 2014 nor HyRrder 2023 manufactured provided this.  Door (atleast Driver side) doesnt Auto unlock when I shut the engine. Not sure if there is an option to change this.  The AC buttons (recirculation on/off for are small (unlike SWIFT), as I use these quiet often and hate these tiny buttons.  I feel providing Gear shift from P - D is more meaningful and user friendly as against P - R - D. There might be some logic, as all manufacturers provide the same way, but wonder why. Yet to understand or need more clarity;  There is button provided for Traction control doesnt seem to make much of a difference.  EV mode button is provided near the hand brake but whenever I select message flashes as EV mode not available.", 15th February 2024,toyota-urban-cruiser,BLR,217,52

Thank you for the update. I test drove Kia Seltos Auto before deciding on Toyota Hyryder S Hybrid variant. Reason for choosing S Hynbrid Variant: - Kia looks good & has feature but is a fuel guzzler. City conditions just 10-12kmpl. - GV has only 2 Full hybrids & both have the Skyroof with very flimsy cover. - I saw reviews where these get heated up during summer & puts more load on the AC. - In any case, I don't see any purpose for skyroof in a city like Mumbai. - Toyota Hyryder S variant does not have the Skyroof feature & that more or less sealed by decision. - I test drove Full Hybrid Hyryder AT from ""Millenium Toyota"" at Thane. I currently drive Honda City CVT, and hence I found the AT version quite responsive as compared to City CVT. - I reset both A & B trips to Zero & drove in full traffic & highway for about 25 min. Average milage was about 24kmpl & with AC switched off, it jumped to 30. - I drive about 50kms per day, 5 days a week. This is not much, but still felt I should own a car, which has good technology in it. - I found the black color look really great for this car. - A rough cost working I got from dealer was about Rs 19.70 lacs for S hybrid variant. - Delivery period currently is about 2 months for this S Hybrid.", 12th March 2024,toyota-urban-cruiser,Mumbai,2,0
1338, TT-S , 16:21 ,BHPian,"I took delivery of an S hybrid 2 weeks back. Had to wait 1 year and 2 months from booking date to finally get an allocation. Even then my choice color was not available and had to settle for Red color. Between booking and delivery, prices went up by 1.5Lacs. However in 2024 S variant gained 6 airbags. Have driven only 300 Kms until now, initial impressions are mostly positive, planning to put up an initial review thread once I clock more miles on the car.", 13th March 2024,toyota-urban-cruiser,Cochin,108,174

I test drove the Hyryder for 30min in Mumbai traffic, and could achive 25+ kmpl. Bangalore weather is pretty cool.....try putting off the AC (run the blower) and see if this makes a difference.", 18th March 2024,toyota-urban-cruiser,Mumbai,2,0
