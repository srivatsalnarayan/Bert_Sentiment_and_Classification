0, AYP , 17:21 ,Senior - BHPian,"Most of us know that the Global Giant Toyota has launched the all new hatchback- Glanza. Yes, it has finally hatched. The link to the thread where Bhpians have discussed about the Glanza- https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/india...ml#post4600248 Is the Glanza basically a rebadged Maruti Baleno with a Toyota logo and a slightly higher price? Not really. Well, most of were expecting it to be like that, however, Toyota has really surprised us by- 1. Pricing the G MT dualjet variant at a very competitive price. It offers the equipment level similar to that of the Baleno Zeta dualjet variant, but is priced only slightly more than the regular Baleno Delta dualjet variant. 2. Keeping the price of the other variants cheaper than the Baleno. Yes, can you believe that a Toyota costs less than a Maruti in the same segment? By a full 12 Rs. at that. 3. A better standard warranty of 3 years/1,00,000 km warranty vs the Baleno's 2 years/40,000 km. 4. Some may not agree, but if you can get a better badge for your ride, then why not just get it? Especially if the better brand is being offered at the same price. And this is in addition to the previous 3 points which have been mentioned. Due to the above points, it has become very clear for me that the Glanza is indeed the superior choice of the 2. I'd say many urban commuters would agree with me. The Baleno's main USP against the Glanza would be Maruti's service network(more relevant for small towns and rural areas) and of course, the availability of the lower Sigma and Delta(non-dualjet) variants. Sometime ago, before all the Glanza and Toyota bashing started(some justified while some aren't IMO), I had shared my opinion on the Baleno vs Glanza assuming that the Glanza would be priced higher- Quote: Originally Posted by AYP Completely agree with what most people are saying. The Maruti Corolla should be a bigger success(relatively speaking) than the Toyota Baleno due to the sheer value which it will most probably offer to the buyer. However, if Toyota can price their Baleno at about 20-30k higher than the Maruti Baleno, then it should do good numbers as well. Better than the Jazz IMO. By paying a slight premium over the Maruti Baleno, you can go from saying that you drive a 'Maruti' to saying that you drive a 'Toyota'. This might sway some buyers towards this car. To be very frank, even I would gladly pay this difference and have a Toyota badge on my grill and on my keyfob. Any higher than 20-30k and/or any omission of features already present in the Maruti Baleno and they are doomed for poor to average sales. Toyota has further strengthened the case for itself by pricing the Glanza sensibly. I would rather have the Toyota badge on my car and Toyota key-fob in my pocket.

8, GTO , 08:30 ,Team-BHP Support,"Must say, I'm pleasantly surprised by how well Toyota has priced the Glanza. Am sure Maruti didn't expect this and any future product-sharing might see Maruti charge a higher price to Toyota, or insist on Toyota keeping more of a price gap at the retail level. Remember, Maruti makes more money in selling to the direct customer, not in the B2B transaction with Toyota. Being how things are, I'd go for the Glanza for Toyota's after-sales, longer warranty etc. and the fact that it's a ""new"" brand. The Baleno has been around for years now. However, it won't be that simple for everyone as the Baleno will have discounts that the Glanza still doesn't, and outside of the big cities, Maruti's service network is untouchable. That said, just because of the VFM pricing, I'm not letting Toyota get away with it. They could have done a LOT more with the car than just a lame badge swap & kit tweaking. Tough times for Nexa salesmen. It's like their mother took their dinner plate away just when they were starving. Last thing that Nexa needed in such a challenging market scenario.

To that he said that there are differences to note and the most significant being that it's not just by sales and marketing tactics that Toyota is offering longer warranty, it because this same engine in Glanza is made at the Suzuki plant and not in Maruti plant. Also quoting him by word, in order extend the warranty, there has been ""inputs"" applied from Toyota engineering to the Glanza production starting from the engine. So it's not altogether the same product as per them. However since Toyota Glanza is BS6 ready, I am not sure if the power / torque delivery has been compromised.

68, shankar.balan , 19:43 ,BANNED,"This is notwithstanding all the talk about this badge engineering and so on. It was mid-June 2019 almost exactly a month ago give or take a day or two. Since Feb 2019, my parents were thinking of saying bye bye to their 5.5 year old Hyundai I 20 Asta Manual Transmission which had 25K kms on the clock. We had bought this brand new in 2014. It was coming up to their 50th Wedding Anniv and I wanted to buy them a gift they would enjoy on a daily basis. Dad (in his mid 70's) as the main driver of the car, wanted a nice spacious and well engineered premium, nice looking, modern, petrol driven biggish hatchback car which sat well on the road, gave him and Mum good comfort, good safety features, a high seating position and most importantly an AT tranny. His other ask was easy maintenance and servicing along with painless reliability. This is their single vehicle for daily use in the city and every few months on the highways between Madras and Bangalore. Dad tested all sorts of cars including the Polo Petrol GT AT and Hyundai Venue Petrol DCT 1 litre Turbo AT and so on. The Polo was too low slung for them though he loved its DSG. The Venue was nice they said but it was too expensive and Hyundai has again compromised on features between the MT and AT versions. I mean how stupid can Hyundai be- the AT version is given a full bench rear seat without 60:40 split folding but the MT gets this simple feature! Plus of course as all manufacturers are wont to do we never ever get the 6-7 airbags in an AT in India. He also tested the Maruti Baleno CVT. But they offer a very limited warranty. The Toyota Glanza CVT top spec V-AT was launched at this time and there were some few cars available in Madras. Both Mum and Dad test drove it around and liked it a lot. It suited them perfectly they said. The car they finally chose came in that lovely luminescent pearly white shade and they vastly preferred the blue interior trim and accents much more than the faux wood which looks rather yellowish and fake as in all Toyotas. I went to see them and wish them for their 50th Anniversary in June, called the dealer, told him to send his chap over to my parents home, simply swiped my credit card towards payment and the car was delivered to my parents in 3 days flat including all the registration, insurance and other stuff. It must be one of the first few Glanzas in Madras. The 5.5 year old I 20 with 25000 kms on the clock was dropped off at T S Mahalingam in Madras (the owner is a very old friend) and we got a fantastic price for it too on account of its extremely well kept and sparingly used condition. The Glanza V-AT cost us 10.7 ish lacs on the road and having test driven it on a short 'chukka' around the city, I do honestly pronounce it a good and sensible car indeed, given the specific use-cases in mind. One of the good clinchers in the Glanza vs the Baleno is the longer and much more useful manufacturer warranty period. The dealer was a nice chap, he gave Dad a number of accessories and mats and car cover and all that FOC. The only change we made in the car is that just after it arrived, Dad went straight to BM Lal in Madras (another old friend) and the stock Apollo Tyres of 195/55/16 were immediately changed over to 205/55/16 Yokohama Earth 1 tyres. He got a nice fair price for the stock Apollos and paid the difference for the Yokos. Better rubber and better grip and handling plus these Yokos do definitely fill the wheel arches much better. So the bottom line according to me is that this Toyota Glanza is a car that makes a lot of people happy so it cant really be all bad !", 21st July 2019,toyota-glanza-vs-maruti-baleno,Bangalore,"11,368","23,077"

80, shankar.balan , 06:45 ,BANNED,"Dad and Mum's Toyota Glanza CVT top spec is now approx 5 months with us. This car must have been amongst the first ones in Madras because we booked and bought it from the dealer's ready stock within a few days of its launch. I have recently had a foot fracture and they are visiting me in BLR and I have actually literally robbed this car from Dad for my daily office commute because I am not able to drive a manual right now. Frankly it is just absolutely first class, spacious both in the front and in the rear, good luggage space, plenty of shoulder room and head room and very easy for any of us to get in and out of, even me, along with my crutches. It seats four persons in great Comfort. Nice and plush interiors. Comfy bright airy cabin despite the dark blue and black upholstery and interior trim. Easy to use 5 speed CVT gearbox and it works perfectly. Sports mode merely holds it in a lower gear for slightly longer but is hardly used in the city. The L mode means it stays in low gear mode but again this is hardly used in the city. It may be useful if driving up and down the hills. The only modification we made after buying it was to chuck the OEM Apollo Alnac tyres and replace them with Yokohama Earth 1 tyres in 205/55/16 size. And now the wheel arches are exceedingly well filled, the car feels far more comfortable and grippy when driving about. The suspension is tuned well for our bad potholed and broken city roads and the car glides along - of course one has to drive carefully in order to preserve the car. The ground clearance of ~ 170mm is quite adequate indeed. And while it may not have the most powerful or responsive engine and gearbox and all the typical enthusiast's tick boxes, believe me, it is an absolute breeze to use as a daily driver. Feels perfectly planted, safe, extremely comfortable and having personally been using it for ~2 months almost daily, I find it to be one of the soundest happy investments I have made for my parents. Dad and Mum love it. My wife and I also love it. I think the badge engineering comments, the other comments about it not being a high performance car and all the other criticism notwithstanding, this car is really worth it for the purpose to which 90-95% of the buying public will put it to- as described above. My parents breeze along between Madras and Bangalore on the highway and this trip being the first, my Dad was perfectly pleased with the car's performance. He definitely prefers it to the I20 manual petrol which he earlier had. He is happy too, with the Glanza's overtaking ability in the small ghat sections between Madras and Bangalore. And its fuel efficiency is fine - we are experiencing approx 11 in the city and 13 on the highway. All I would have wanted more in it is the option of 6 Airbags like one gets in the Manual Top Spec, an engine capable of 100 bhp like the Baleno RS and rear disc brakes. If it had been available in such a spec with an 7-8 speed CVT gearbox, it would have been too good!

If it had been available in such a spec with an 7-8 speed CVT gearbox, it would have been too good! Actually this is incorrect. The Baleno (Glanza too obviously) is not a 5 speed CVT. It is a 0 step CVT. There are no fake steps in the CVT box unlike what honda and Toyota do. A CVT is infinite gears and it just moves the CVT belt across the conical pulley.

Glanza's steering is super light, wasn't comfortable initially. The engine response is better in Glanza, on a tap on the accelerator pedal. Baleno has better brakes. The Baleno had a bit of struggle to gather speed on a slight incline with four adults on board. I could not do the same test on Glanza due to lack of time and heavy traffic. The Baleno engine noise (whirrng sound) was bit more compared to Glanza. The so called ""rubber band"" effect was more pronouced in Baleno. May be due to higher load (four adults) on Baleno versus two on Glanza. Roads in my neighbourhood are bad; the Glanza was slightly better on those roads. But thsi could be due to higher tyre pressure on the Baleno. I am not sure, I didn't check the pressure. Could it be due to the fact that the Toyota car was pretty newer compared to the Baleno? Don't know for sure. I also liked the fact that the Toyota salesman was not as insistent as the Nexa salesman. I am getting two calls daily from the Nexa showroom since the TD. Another important point: the MID wasn't showing the distance covered; it was reset to some 9999 or some thing like that. I was bit surprised. Price wise, both are neck to neck. May be a 10k difference at best. Overall, it's a tough call between the two. However, if I am buying this car, I would most likely pick the Glanza over Baleno.

The price difference between the lower trims isn't much but the difference increases with the higher trims to around Rs.30,000 ex-showroom.

121, VPJ74 , 22:20 ,BHPian,Black on Blue is just hideous! Add the same on car seats. The Baleno interior felt dull and dark. Glanza with their 3 year warranty would be my choice., 28th July 2022,toyota-glanza-vs-maruti-baleno,Mumbai,200,194
122, VPJ74 , 13:24 ,BHPian,"I want to share my experience with a Toyota Dealer (Madhuban) in Mumbai regarding the Glanza test drive. I am in the market for a premium Hatchback so considering among others the Baleno and Glanza. The Maruti dealer is a bit far away so I visited the Toyota showroom nearby and looked at the Glanza and Urban Cruiser. I liked the display model of Glanza so asked for a TD. Today, I received a call from the dealer asking about any questions which I might have. I reminded them about the TD and he calmly said that the TD of Glanza is not possible because they don't have a TD car! I was speechless for a while and then asked again. The dealer replied that there is no Glanza TD car made available from Toyota itself, yet! I was too shocked and muttered something like ""how do you expect me to buy a car without TD"" and hung up on him. BTW - I had visited the NEXA showroom a couple of days back and did TD the Baleno AMT. I liked the car but not the interiors, so wanted to take a longer TD from Toyota. I know that there is a huge waitlist on Baleno so a few thoughts: 1. Toyota feels that car is so good that customers don't need a TD. 2. Toyota thinks that serious buyers will TD the car at Maruti so they don't need a TD car. 3. Toyota's attitude and service towards non-Toyota cars is of poor quality and internally they want to discourage its sales. 4. The dealer is lying or is not keen on selling non-Toyota cars or wants to minimise their expenses in selling Glanza/UC etc etc Whatever may be the reason it has left a bad taste in my mouth and dented my trust in the massive Toyota brand. I haven't made a decision about my car but with the above experience and Jazz also dropping out - maybe we are left with only MIAL and Hyundai in the hatchback market.", 29th July 2022,toyota-glanza-vs-maruti-baleno,Mumbai,200,194

I think this may just be the case of the dealership near you, as far as dealerships near me (in Kerala), the dealers are very good and trying hard to sell their products. I was and still am in the market for a good automatic car under 15 lakhs on-road, so just casually enquired via Cardekho and Carwale website, I got a call immediately from the dealer and had a very good experience with the Nippon Toyota dealership, with their sales executives being very friendly and offering me test drives of both the Glanza and the Urban Cruiser in the AMT and AT guise respectively. But the AMT didn't feel great and the new Brezza was just about to launch, but now considering the prices of the Brezza AT, the Urban Cruiser certainly feels Value for Money. Despite the same, I booked a Kia Sonet Diesel AT, considering it is a frugal Diesel AT within my budget, but since their waiting is long, I am looking out for other cars and if I don't find a better buy, I can happily go with the Sonet.", 30th July 2022,toyota-glanza-vs-maruti-baleno,Thrissur/Kochi,260,332

It seems untrue that a company willing to sell its cars in market is unable to provide a test drive. If this was really the case then it should be common all over the country. I would urge you to reach out to the manufacturer directly for arranging a test drive, I am sure you will get a positive response. I did TD of Glanza in Chennai, sales person was calm and patient about all the questions I asked him personally, over phone and in WhatsApp. PS not all salesmen are passionate about their jobs, so look for another dealer.", 31st July 2022,toyota-glanza-vs-maruti-baleno,Chennai,46,68
