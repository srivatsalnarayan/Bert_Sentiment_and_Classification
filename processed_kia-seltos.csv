Since the Kia Seltos has already been reviewed by Team-BHP, this report will only focus on changes made to the 2023 facelift. To read the full official review, click here. Introduction It’s safe to say that anyone looking for a mid-size SUV is somewhat spoilt for choice these days. There are just so many cars currently competing for the top spot and each one has something unique to offer. However, Kia Seltos has been a consistent performer in this segment and the 2023 facelift just builds on the existing legacy. Kia made a smashing entry into the Indian market with the Seltos as their first product in 2019. However, since then there hasn't been a major change in terms of the product and the car remained relatively the same. We finally have the first refresh in 2023 and Kia has gone with the ‘Don't fix what’s not broken’ approach on this one. And it makes perfect sense as the Seltos at the time of launch was a car that was mechanically sound, loaded with features and well-priced for what it offered. In the 2023 facelift, Kia builds upon this strong foundation. You have 3 engine options – a 113 BHP, 1.5-litre naturally aspirated (NA) petrol, a 158 BHP, 1.5-litre turbo-petrol and a 114 BHP, 1.5-litre turbo-diesel. You get a 6-speed manual transmission with the 1.5 NA petrol engine with an option of a CVT automatic. The 1.5 turbo-petrol can be had with a 6-speed iMT or a 7-speed DCT automatic. Lastly, the 1.5 diesel engine gets a 6-speed iMT as standard and the top-end variants can be opted with a 6-speed torque converter automatic. In essence, there are 3 engine options, 2 types of MT options, and 3 types of automatic gearboxes on offer. Additionally, there are 7 variants, 8 monotone body colours, 2 dual tone colours, 1 matte finish colour, 6 interior colours & seat patterns, and 5 alloy wheel designs. So when Kia says there’s something for everyone, they mean it. Kia Seltos Price & Brochure Prices for the 2023 Seltos start at Rs. 10.90 lakh for the 1.5-litre NA petrol and go to Rs. 16.60 lakh for the HTX variant with the CVT automatic. The 1.5-litre NA petrol with the CVT transmission is unfortunately not available in the top-end HTX+ / GTX+ / X-Line variants. This means that it misses out on some of the features like the 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless charger, ventilated seats, 8-way powered seats and most importantly ADAS functions (GTX+ & X-Line). As Hyundai did with the Verna, Kia should’ve offered the 1.5 NA petrol on the top-end variant as well. This would also help Kia draw some customers from the Toyota HyRyder and Maruti Grand Vitara, which have a combined monthly sales figure of ~10,000 units. The 1.5 turbo-petrol prices start at Rs. 15 lakh for the 6-speed iMT in the HTK+ variant and go up to Rs. 20 lahks for the DCT automatic top-end X-Line variant. The Seltos diesel prices start at Rs. 12 lakh and go up to Rs. 20 lakh for the top-end AT in the X-Line trim. You can check the detailed price list here. In this segment, we would say that the Seltos is priced well considering what it offers. Comparing the prices of the top-end variants, it is the costliest in the segment, but not by much. The Skoda Kushaq and VW Taigun are close, but they don’t offer ADAS features.

1, Omkar , 10:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"2023 Kia Seltos Facelift Exterior Review The Seltos retains the aggressive front face and has very similar design cues as the pre-facelift version. What’s new is the aggressive front tiger nose grille which has grown in size and the bumper has been redesigned as well: Changes to the rear are significant, but just like the front, carries forward some essential design elements. You now have connected LED tail lamps on a redesigned tailgate. The rear bumper also gets a new design and houses reflectors and reversing lamps: Not many changes to the side profile except for the length of the car which has gone up by 50 mm and now measures 4,365 mm. The wheelbase (2,610 mm) and other dimensions of the car (Width = 1,800 mm and Height = 1,645 mm) remain the same: Kia claims that the new Seltos has a reinforced occupant compartment that makes it safer and more reliable. Also, a lot of the safety features are now standard across all variants. We will wait for the GNCAP test results of the new Seltos to comment on the safety aspect: This is the top-end X-Line variant which comes exclusively in this Matte Graphite paint shade. A lot of the chrome elements have been blacked out on this variant. The paint finish is really good and the car looks great in person: Kia calls these ‘Dazzling Crown Jewel’ LED headlamps. You have turn indicators down below and the LED DRL strip runs from the indicator pod to the headlamp pod and continues over the grille: You now have sequential turn indicators: A closer look at the new Tiger nose grille. The LED DRLs run across the middle instead of being on the top edge of the previous car. The front camera also sits higher up than before: Here’s a look at the redesigned bumper of the GT Line and X-Line. The Tech Line gets a different design (keep reading). The Seltos facelift is equipped with ADAS Level 2 tech. Its front Radar sensor sits in the middle of the bumper. ‘Ice Cube’ LED fog lamps have been carried forward, but you get 4 cubes instead of 3 now: Gloss black ORVM cover with integrated turn indicators and side camera: The X-Line and GTX+ variants come with 18-inch crystal cut alloy wheels shod with 215/55 section tyres. While the alloy wheel design is nice and most people won’t complain, I prefer the older design: Rear wheel disc brakes are standard across all variants: Here’s a look at the 17-inch crystal cut alloy wheels of the HTX and HTX+ variants. They’re shod with 215/60 section tyres: A welcome feature on the Seltos is this panoramic sunroof. Note that the shark-fin antenna now has a more aerodynamic design: HTX+ variants and above get a glossy black spoiler: You now get these taller taillamps that are now full LED: They also get sequential turn indicators: The LED tail lamps are connected from end to end. This looks much better than the earlier version’s chrome strip: A look at the redesigned bumper. You get reversing lights and reflectors at the bottom. Yes, those are dual exhaust pipes and… … they’re not just aesthetic, they're functional: Here’s a look at the front of the Seltos Tech line variants. It features a different bumper design with a brushed silver skid plate. The car in this picture is the Imperial Blue paint shade: Similarly, the rear bumper gets a different design. You don’t get the dual exhaust setup here, instead, there’s a simple skid plate design. The reversing lamps and reflectors have also been repositioned: Kia has introduced this new Pewter olive shade with the facelift: Here’s the Seltos in Sparkling Silver paint shade: This is the Intense Red paint shade. Other colour options include Clear White, Gravity Grey, Aurora Black Peral and Glacier White Pearl : ", 23rd July 2023,kia-seltos,Mumbai,"1,737","21,011",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
2, Omkar , 10:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"2023 Kia Seltos Facelift Interior Review Changes to the interiors are subtle but noticeable. You get a very contemporarily styled dashboard with a large display panel that includes a touchscreen and a digital instrument cluster. In the X-Line variant that you see here, you get all-black interiors with Sage green inserts. Lower variants get 5 additional interior colour schemes and seat patterns: The flat-bottom steering wheel has been carried forward from the previous Seltos. It has contrast red stitching and is a nice unit to hold and operate. It gets tilt and telescopic adjustment: MID and ADAS-related controls are placed on the right spoke. Also, note that the Seltos automatic variants get paddle shifters too: The driver gets a 10.25-inch fully digital instrument cluster. It has a typical 3-pod display which is customizable. The display is crisp, and you can get a lot of information from the screen: Most importantly, you get ADAS-related information displayed on the screen. You also get trip-related information like distance travelled, distance to empty, etc. TPMS is standard across all variants: As mentioned earlier, the display is customisable and you get different colour themes in different driving modes  Eco, Normal & Sport: Heres a nifty feature thats an extension of the 360-degree camera setup. When you switch on a turn indicator, the feed from the corresponding ORVM camera is displayed on that side of the MID pod: The Seltos is equipped with ADAS Level 2 tech with 17 autonomous features. The system features one front and two rear RADAR sensors which allow it to have features like forward collision avoidance assist, smart cruise control, blind spot collision avoidance, rear cross-traffic collision avoidance, etc. Heres the display with adaptive cruise control engaged: Like the previous Seltos, you get a head-up display. Whats new is that it now also displays ADAS-related information: While the side air vent design and the engine start / stop button remain the same, the buttons next to it have been rejigged. You now get an auto idle start / stop button along with traction control, head-up display and headlamp leveller: The doorpad design remains the same and heres how it looks in the new Sage Green colour scheme: Window controls are now backlit and note that all the windows now get auto up and down feature: A look at the X-Line trim 'Sage Green' leatherette seats with a chevron pattern. Front seats are ventilated, which is a boon in our conditions. Under-thigh & back support are satisfactory. On the downside, those with a heavy build might find them a size too small: These are brown leatherette seats that are available on the HTX+ variant: Driver's seat is 8-way electrically adjustable but you still don't get a lumbar adjustment. The design of these switches is new and they feel sturdy & durable. Finding a comfortable driving position is super easy: Aluminium pedals look sporty: The blind-spot monitoring system works well and can even detect bikers precisely: IRVM is wide enough to cover the entire rear windshield. Rear headrests and thick C-pillars restrict visibility though: It houses 3 buttons - SOS will place an emergency call to Kia customer care, the button with the tow truck will call Kia Roadside Assistance and the third button will launch Kia Connect. An auto-dimming function has been provided as well: Center fascia largely remains the same barring the new touchscreen, the sleeker central AC vents and the HVAC controls are also new: This is the new 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment unit mated to an 8-speaker BOSE sound system. The display is nice and crisp and the font size is perfect: You have this funky purple and pink colour scheme as standard. As is with most modern touchscreens, you can have a split display as well. You can also adjust the climate control settings and control the internal air circulation under various conditions. The system gets Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity, however, it is not wireless. Interestingly, the smaller 8-inch touchscreen on the lower variants gets wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay: By default, you get some soothing nature sounds in case you are bored of listening to advertisements on the radio. You can also choose different settings for the Bose sound system. The cluster theme can be selected through the touchscreen as well. The reversing camera quality is acceptable. The 360-degree camera feature is very usable while parking in tight spaces: Lastly, you can toggle through various vehicle settings related to the driver assistance features (ADAS). If youre not sure what a particular option does, the description is right below. The head-up display settings are also included in the vehicle settings menu: New on the Kia Seltos facelift is the dual-zone climate control. Good to see Kia retaining physical buttons and not opting for the touch-sensitive panels that we see on modern cars. The audio control buttons are placed below. Also, check out the new sleeker central AC vents: Below, you have a wireless charger that interestingly gets a cooling function for your phone. Unfortunately, the wireless charger is tucked below the AC control panel, so you wont be able to see any notifications on your phone. Below you have a 12V power socket, a USB type A port and a USB type C port: The gear lever setup has been carried forward along with the switches around it: An electronic parking brake with auto hold function is a welcome addition to the facelift. This has freed up a lot of space here and you get a slot for keeping your phone below the EPB. Next to it, you get a cubbyhole with a sliding cover which also doubles up as a cupholder: The centre armrest is wrapped in black leather which looks a bit odd in between the sage green coloured seats: Panoramic sunroof lets in plenty of light and manages to make an all-black cabin feel airy: All three passengers get individually adjustable headrests and 3-point seatbelts. Earlier Seltos had a lap belt for the middle passenger: The seatback has a comfortable angle. The headroom is good. The thigh support is alright however, taller people might find the seat to be a little lower than expected though. Legroom is healthy and two 6-footers can sit one behind the other in reasonable comfort: Like the previous car, the air purifier is placed inside the front centre armrest. You can now directly adjust its fan and display settings with the help of the buttons next to the display: Below you have a small cubbyhole and two USB type C ports: Rear grab handles now also get LED reading lamps: The Seltos is equipped with UV-cut glass for the windshield as well as all the windows: Boot space of the Seltos remains the same at 433 litres: Spare on this X-Line trim is a 17-inch steel wheel shod with 215/60 section tyre: The new and classy looking keyfob gets buttons on the side. You have the lock and unlock buttons at the top, followed by the remote start button and the tailgate unlock button: ", 23rd July 2023,kia-seltos,Mumbai,"1,737","21,011","Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive
3, Omkar , 10:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Driving the Kia Seltos 1.5L Turbo-Petrol DCT Automatic The 138 BHP, 1.4-litre Kappa turbo-petrol engine mated to the 7-speed DCT in the previous Seltos was quite powerful and quick. However, the engine had to be upgraded to meet the emission norms. The result is this Smartstream 1.5-litre turbo-petrol engine which still belongs to the Kappa family and makes an impressive 158 BHP and 253 Nm and is shared with the new Hyundai Verna. It has the highest numbers in its segment. The claimed 0-100 km/h time is 8.9 seconds, which means that the new Seltos 1.5 turbo petrol is quicker than the older 1.4 turbo petrol by 0.9 seconds. Fire up the engine, and it's refined at idle, silently purring away. Hyundai-Kia powertrains have always set NVH benchmarks, and this car is no different. Shift to D or R, and it crawls away smoothly. Crawling at city speeds isn’t very dramatic and the 1.5L is very well-behaved. With light to medium throttle inputs, you can go about your daily commute quite comfortably. In comparison with the old 1.4L turbo-petrol, the throttle response is smoother and power delivery is more linear. The 7-speed dual-clutch transmission is also seamless moving through the initial gears. However, we did notice that the gearbox got a little confused on a few instances while driving through some traffic. The engine has a healthy bottom end and thanks to a turbocharger and direct injection, you’re never in a shortage of power. Just floor the accelerator if you want to close a gap in traffic or make that quick overtake and the engine and gearbox will do the rest. Get on some open roads and you can let the Seltos stretch its legs. Put down your right foot and before you know it, you’ll hit the highway speed limit of 120 km/h. This is the thing with turbo-petrols - flooring the throttle on an empty stretch of road can get addictive. Outright acceleration is great and it feels a little more linear as well compared to say, the 1.5 TSI from the VW-Skoda cars. The turbo delivers a strong mid-range punch that will take care of all the overtaking on the highway. You can cruise along the highway at 100 km/h while the engine spins at a relaxed 1,800 rpm. Even at 120 km/h, the engine felt relaxed with the rev counter reading 2,200 rpm. The Seltos won't break a sweat cruising at these speeds all day long. The dual-clutch transmission moves through the gears quite seamlessly. The kickdown response time is quick enough and the gearbox doesn’t hesitate to drop down 3 or even 4 gears at times to get the engine into the powerband. When you are in the mood for some fun in the ghats, switch to Sport mode and start flipping the paddle shifters for manual control. The ECU matches the revs and you’ll hear the sweet note of the engine. Yes, IMO, the engine sounds nice and sporty at high revs. Although Kia has restricted the maximum rpm to 5,900, which is too low, at least the engine sounds great as it reaches that number. The paddle shifters are responsive, and you can extract some performance from the engine using them for quick overtakes or keeping the engine in the powerband over some twisties. There is also an “S” mode which makes the transmission more aggressive. This mode can be engaged by moving the gear shifter to the right. However, the gearbox logic in the Taigun and Kushaq 1.5 DSG is better and more in tune with the requirements of the driver. The Seltos gets 3 drive modes - Eco, Normal and Sport. Eco Mode - Engage the Eco mode when you want to extract maximum fuel efficiency. The throttle response is dulled, but given the power on tap, the mode is quite comfortable to use in the city. In fact, we preferred driving in this mode in the city as the car becomes a lot smoother to drive. The Auto Start-Stop feature is activated automatically when you select the Eco mode. Normal Mode - This is the default mode and just as the name suggests, it's normal to drive. The difference between Normal and Eco modes is very little. Sport Mode - Engage this mode when you want the car to be more responsive to your inputs. The throttle response is sharper, and the transmission also holds on to gears a bit longer in this mode. The steering is also noticeably heavier, although not as much as enthusiasts would like (more on this later). The Sport mode isn't something you'd want to engage in the city as it can get a bit jerky to drive. Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH) The 1.5-litre unit is very refined overall. At city speeds as well as while cruising at 100 km/h, you can barely hear the engine in the cabin. Even the vibrations are well controlled and cruising with the family on the highway should be comfortable. Kia claims that the dual pipe muffler design for the GT Line variants improves the exhaust noise. In comparison with the previous 1.4L turbo-petrol engine, the noise levels are lower by 1 decibel. Kia also claims that the front roll rod bush has been tuned to reduce high-speed booming. Road noise from the tyres does creep into the cabin at highway speeds, but the wind noise is kept well in check. The engine has a sporty note to it at high revs. Mileage & Fuel economy The Seltos comes equipped with an Auto Start-Stop feature that helps fuel efficiency in city driving conditions. The ARAI-certified fuel efficiency for the 1.5-litre turbo-petrol DCT is 17.9 km/l and that for the 6-speed iMT is 17.7 km/l. Of course, the real-world FE numbers will be much lower considering that turbo-petrol DCTs are very sensitive to the driving style. We’ll wait for some ownership reviews to get a better picture of real-world fuel efficiency. The 1.5 turbo petrol also features CVVD (Continuously Variable Valve Duration) which is claimed to not only achieve a boost in performance but also an improvement in fuel efficiency. In comparison, in engines with CVVT (Continuously Variable Valve Timing) or CVVL (Continuously Variable Valve Lift), the volume of air admitted is controlled by adjusting the depth of the opening. The duration cannot be controlled here. CVVD regulates the duration of valve opening and closing according to different driving conditions. For instance, when the vehicle is maintaining a constant speed and requires low engine output, CVVD holds open the intake valve until the middle of the compression stroke and from that point holds it closed until near the end of the compression stroke. This helps to improve fuel efficiency by reducing the resistance caused by compression. 1.5L, 4-cylinder turbo-petrol engine makes 158 BHP @ 5,500 rpm and 253 Nm @ 1,500-3,500 rpm: The turbocharger sits at the back and the 1.5 also features low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation to reduce pumping losses: Fuel tank capacity remains the same at 50 litres and the new Seltos is E20 compatible: Suspension Ride Comfort This is an area that was concerning for most people in the earlier Seltos. The ride quality was noticeably firm which was a deal breaker for many. However, in the 2023 facelift, Kia has increased the dampening force which has softened up the ride. There’s still an underlying stiffness to the ride quality, but overall the setup is very similar to what you would find in a Creta. It’s much more liveable now and most owners would appreciate this change even on the 18-inch wheels. At slow speeds, the ride isn’t bone-jarring and small bumps and potholes are absorbed comfortably. The suspension works silently in absorbing small bumps and potholes. There’s still some amount of body roll felt inside the cabin over bad roads, but it’s manageable. The Seltos gets a McPherson strut suspension at the front and a torsion beam axle at the rear. The GTX+ and X-Line variants come equipped with 18-inch alloy wheels shod with 215/55 section tyres. HTX and HTX+ variants get 17-inch wheels shod with 215/60 section tyres. The lower variants (HTE, HTK, HTK+) get 16-inch wheels with 205/65 section tyres. Handling & Dynamics Kia may have softened the suspension by a bit, but the Seltos still has an inherently mature suspension setup. It means that the Seltos behaves nicely at high speed. There is no bounciness or that feeling of floatiness. The car is well-planted with satisfactory high-speed stability. While doing triple-digit speeds on the open road, the Seltos displayed good composure. Recovery from expressway undulations is also surprisingly good for a Korean car. In the area of dynamics, the Seltos is a clean & predictable handler. Through fast corners, the car remains sorted and there are no unnerving surprises. Of course, due to its height, some body roll is present, but it is well-controlled and one can push it through corners confidently. The difference between the previous setup and this one is little and you will notice only when you’re on the limit. Good to know that all variants are equipped with ESP which can be a lifesaver in emergencies. Our test car was shod with JK UX Royale tyres whose grip levels were average. BHPians looking to extract some performance might want to upgrade to richer Michelin or Yokohama rubber. Steering The Seltos gets a well-tuned EPS steering. It is light & smooth in the city. As the speedometer climbs, the EPS feels reasonably direct and fast too. The fair all-round visibility, smooth gearboxes (automatics in particular) and light controls make this crossover easy to drive in urban conditions. On the highway, the steering feels stable and has no nervousness. Braking Kia has made all-wheel disc brakes standard across all variants. Additionally, you also get brake assist and ABS. While braking from high speeds, the car stops in a straight line without any drama. No complaints in the braking area. The brake pedal felt extremely sharp to the inputs and you have to be very gentle with the application to decelerate smoothly. Niggles & Problems The standard warranty of the Seltos is 3 years for unlimited km which can be extended up to the 5th year. Sadly, Kia doesn’t offer an extended warranty of up to 7 years like Hyundai. While most of the recent feedback about this 1.5-litre turbo-petrol has been positive, the turbo-petrol engine with the dual-clutch transmission is something you should be careful with. Early owners of the Creta & Seltos 1.4 turbo-petrol DCT did face some gearbox overheating issues. While most of them have been resolved, it’s very much advisable to go for the maximum extended warranty. Don’t even think about it twice, it’s better to be safe than sorry.

6, Rajeevraj , 10:27 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Very Nice review. Car looks fantastic in that matt shade. All in all looks a good upgrade to an already blockbuster product and expect it to set the sales charts on fire. The amount of features Hyundai-Kia are throwing into their cars is mind boggling. I kind of got confused looking at all the options in the review itself. Will take quite sometime for owners to get a hang of everything. The other thing I was wondering is how as new driver assist features keep coming in, how as drivers, we need to adjust our driving practices to include the new tech features into the driving habits. Example: The camera turning on when you put on the indicators bring in a new visual cue that as a driver we need to adjust to. We have also already talked a lot about ADAS and it's impact. Of course, this has always been the case, but now the tech expansion inside a vehicle is increasing exponentially faster than before and it seems hard to keep up and adjust. I guess a lot of drivers will embrace it and a lot will get overwhelmed and turn a lot of it off.", 23rd July 2023,kia-seltos,Bangalore,"4,603","17,628",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

9, Gannu_1 , 10:56 ,Team-BHP Support,"Thanks a lot Omkar for having me for the drive. It was so much fun especially testing the ADAS on the dual lane carriageways and the new 1.5 turbo petrol engine with the DCT. Guys, this was my first time driving a car equipped with ADAS and I would say Kia has implemented it nicely. With the roads having lane markers at the centre and sides (even service lanes with barely visible lane markers), the front camera neatly picked them up and once the ACC (adaptive cruise control) was set to 80 kmph, the car began cruising steadily picking up the inputs through the sensors, automatically reducing speed when the front radar senses a vehicle. Then we switch lanes and the car picks up speed to the set speed without any fuss. I was really excited, tried taking my hands off the steering for a short while (to test the warning system) and the steering auto corrects the course when it senses the lane markers changing the direction. This is so cool! If the car senses the hands are no longer on the steering, it gives these annoying beeps prompting the user to hold the wheel. After a brief drive, it prompted a fatigue alert asking us to take a break. For VW users, this isnt new, as the Jetta and Passat has a fatigue alert system. We also had a brief demo of the emergency braking manoeuvre while reversing, when a pedestrian crosses the road and while creeping into the adjacent lane at an empty parking lot organised by Kia (pictured above). The braking action is incredibly quick! If someone hasnt worn a seatbelt, itll toss them to the front. Here are some of the ADAS demonstrations that Kia did: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvLKLP_V9_c ADAS is well and truly here. Gone are those days when we claimed cruise control was useless. Expect Kia and Hyundai to be the first to bring them to the mass market cars. As regards safety of the new Seltos, Kia has made all the safety features standard across the variants. I hope the 6 airbags with the host of safety suite and the improved structure (?) gives it a better NCAP rating. This is the only major downside for an otherwise sorted car. Some other points: - The 10.25 cluster with the 10.25 infotainment unit is nicely integrated and looks sleek: Here is a detailed video on the infotainment system and everything it has to offer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WERUj2FdOc - Connected tail lamp clusters are a swag now. Kia has got it quite well: - The matte graphite shade looks kickass. Maintenance will however be a pain like we experienced after a slight drizzle: - Resolution of the infotainment unit is 1920 x 720 just in case youre wondering. Looks crisp, zero lags: - The infotainment system plays FLAC files too. I tested it with a pen drive. Does anyone listen to FLAC anymore? Guess most have switched to online music streaming. - The sharkfin aerial has been tweaked a bit from the outgoing model: - The Seltos now offers anti-pinch feature for all the windows as demonstrated here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ul-V_huWLQ ", 23rd July 2023,kia-seltos,Madras,"7,167","20,168",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

Come the GNCAP rating and the detailed TBHP analysis on how the Indian version is deliberately made less safe structurally, I had developed a very bad impression about the brand. It left a very sour taste in me. When I bought the XUV300, I had considered the Sonet but only briefly chucking it away because I thought I should not put my money on a brand that deliberately avoids a safer car for India (and other similar markets).

Im starting to question whether my principles are big enough to let go of such a superb package I really hope they crash test this and give a solid competition to the German brothers.

I happened to unexpectedly see the 2023 Seltos when I had gone to check out a couple of used Seltos 1.4 MTs at a Kia Pre Owned outlet. The display car was a HTX+ 1.5 Turbo. It looked good in that shade of blue. My brother was actually looking at the Seltos turbo or the Skoda-VW twins as his Dzire replacement. He liked the space and the features inside the car. He was also impressed with the dual display for the instrumentation and infotainment system. The Bose sound system worked well, but as good as my XUV700's Sony unit. But one thing I noticed is that on the Seltos, you sit a bit too close to the steering wheel (even after adjusting the seat and the steering). The space between the steering wheel, my knees and my upper body was less. Even the footwell area could have been better designed. I have really huge thighs, so the spacing of the steering column and the pedals are important to me. The Carens felt a little better in this aspect, having better space management of the footwell area and keeping the centre console as thin as possible. The gear lever was rightly placed and even the visibility was good. My brother is around 5 ft 11 inches tall and he felt that the Carens actually has more headroom than the Seltos. For now, he's confused between the Seltos Turbo MT and the Carens Turbo MT. My observation after seeing both the cars back to back is that the Carens may be slightly more comfortable than the Seltos.

46, Amyth Prabhakar , 21:08 ,BHPian,"Excellent review as always!! I currently own the top end GTX+ 7 DCT variant. I had been to the showroom and noticed a couple of things. The updated Seltos looks great from inside out but here are some things that I feel that KIA really needs to pay attention to. Structural safety is high priority. Although they say it has been improved to some extent in the SA manual, cannot rely on that until the NCAP test. Heads up display has now been removed from the GTX+ variant. Considering the price difference to be only 20K between X-Line and GT-Line, why would they not provide this in GT Line? Looks to me like cost cutting. Better color combination especially for the GT-Line interiors. All black is a big NO and the interiors looks like it is from a car below 10L segment. The interior roof too is made up of all black fabric. It looks so soiled. Very disgusting and disappointing. Black and beige is what brings more premium-ness to the cabin space in my opinion. I am not a fan of that sage green interiors either. Really don't know why KIA does not understand this. The interior mood lighting is pathetic like before. Earlier there was a dedicated switch to control the brightness, but now it has been removed. The BOSE speakers ? Looks like BOSE badging on ordinary speakers. The sound quality is just average. No improvement done here. The same old crap carried forward from the existing Seltos. The rear AC is just like how it is on my existing Seltos. It is not as powerful as it is in the front. No improvement what so ever. They missed adding the Electric tail gate feature which I think could have been included for the premium price tag of 25L for the top end.(Other brands like MG have it for almost the same price) More metallic colors for X-Line variant or consider adding HUD for GT Line. The matte finish is difficult to maintain and requires a full body PPF which pushes the cost by another lakh or more depending on the PPF brand. The video quality feed from the cameras all around the vehicle can also be improved. The parcel tray at the rear still rattles when the vehicle goes over bumps. Although I have not test driven the new vehicle, I can tell by just seeing that as there are no improvements done for that. These are the things that KIA should have really looked into. The panoramic sunroof screen or shade makes a lot of noise while opening. . Don't know if it is the same on other brands. I have no experience here.

59, neel911 , 11:32 ,BHPian,"Superb review. Thanks for all details. Few things: - The improvement in suspension seem to have more or less nullified by the 18inch wheels. This is a bummer for folks who are giving a premium for features at cost of harsher ride over lower variants - Even if we want to change tyres right away, the JK ones may not provide much of buy back value leading to higher amount to be shelled for new tyres - The max 5 year warranty is something that needs to be considered when going for the new 1.5 Turbo Petrol engine (as long term reliability is not known) - I see that the Auto Engine off during idling might help this engine but this is something I always disable. - Is the middle seat more uncomfortable that outgoing generation? The reviews talk about hard back (due to movable arm support) ? - The panoramic sunroof does help for roomier cabin but lot of times you will keep the cover closed due to heat and which will make the cabin feel really dark on GTX line (black seats and black roofline) Having booked GTX+, the suspension is something that is going to be critical (waiting for TD vehicle) before shelling close to 25L OTR Bangalore.

Hope this is a one off incident, and we do see genuine inputs about the cars being driven and not just plain Cut Copy Paste. I know the engines and gearboxes are similar, but from my experience, driving a Hyundai Venue and Kia Sonet, there are considerable differences in the way both drive. In this case one is a long sedan, while the other is a tall CSUV with good ground clearance. I drove the Verna 1.5L turbo petrol DCT earlier this year and the same powertrain has been used in the Seltos. Now this is not the case where the engine is the same, but the tuning is different (Say the Thar and XUV700). You can even compare the peak power and torque figures and the corresponding rpms. Additionally, when we test cars, we check the rpm readings at various speeds and make observations accordingly. There are countless other factors on which we base our driving observations (we have an exhaustive checklist for observations too). So, when it comes to penning down the observations, the engine characteristics are the same with the Verna and the Seltos. Hence, theres no point in reinventing the wheel and giving an impression to the reader that theyre different. Theres a massive difference when it comes to the suspension characteristics and the way both cars feel behind the wheel because of their body types. That's common knowledge. But judging a car based on just the way the engine behaves isnt right. Quote: Originally Posted by venus1975 10.25-inch HD touchscreen navigation is actually available in HTX.

62, swoosh , 12:14 ,BHPian,"The pricing is spot on for the features and performance offered and it competes with wide range of cars in 15 to 35 lakhs segment. With facelift of Seltos, KIA has just killed the future of Honda in India. Honda Elevate doesn’t stand any chance against the Seltos. Some people compare Elevate's 1.5 NA CVT and the Seltos' 1.5 NA CVT, the reality is that most general car buyers won't delve into such technicalities. The real-world comparison will be Seltos vs. Elevate, and the Seltos outshines the Elevate in every aspect (barring GNCAP rating?) While some enthusiasts may emphasize Honda's proven VTEC engine with CVT, the average buyer is likely to be swayed by the Seltos' overall features, looks, and feel. Even if Honda were to price the Elevate competitively, it seems that people would still be willing to pay a little extra for the Seltos due to its superior offerings and overall aesthetics. It's unfortunate for the Elevate, and one can't help but feel sorry for Honda. But, launching a car in 2023 with a decade old powertrain puts the onus on Honda's poor management decisions. By being five years late to the market, Honda not only lost the time but also missed out on the opportunity to evolve the product effectively.", 24th July 2023,kia-seltos,Bangalore,119,633,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Negative

The suspension on the Kia Seltos is tuned to be on the stiffer side. If you increase the width of the tyres,the high speed stability and grip levels will be improved but you have to sacrifice the comfort as the contact patch of the tyres with the road is increased,even smaller undulations will be filtered through the cabin. Myself upgraded the tyres of my Taigun GT plus to Michelin Pilot sport 225/50/17 The Stability and braking has improved drastically. But now I feel each and every imperfections on the road as the suspension itself is a bit stiff in the Taigun. The Steering wheel has now become a bit hard.

The few complaints I had with the previous seltos: - Confused DCT at low speeds. Man, the throttle inputs felt like it was choking the car up until it hit the 2.2-2.5k rpm mark. Even simple uphills were a challenge to start at rest from. - Paint quality - Difference in bumper and door shade started appearing very early on. Might be because of different materials, but it's still not a good sight on your new car. - General button quality lower down in the dash, near the gear knob. - steering leather wear out. - SAFETY!! Hopefully now though, they have addressed most of what it takes to make an already intuitive car even more so. If the safety rating improves, there's nothing holding the Seltos back this time. 2-zone climate control and standard rear disc brakes in a car costing this side of 25 Lakhs is no small thing honestly.

Yes there is some complimentary add ons like underbody and rodent treatment and wheel balancing and alignment. All insurance companies have a list of cashless garages available on their website, (the same way as they do for cashless hospitals). The My Convenience Plus package consists of 5 years of pre-paid maintenance coverage (service), which would have cost around Rs.30699 for diesel and Rs. 28699 for petrol cars. The extended warranty with 5-year coverage costs around Rs. 26533 for Diesel and Rs.23878 for Petrol. To add to this you get 5 years of Roadside assistance too. You get a complimentary wheel alignment, wheel balancing, and tire rotation for every 10,000 km service till 50,000 km, along with tire alloy protection in the initial year, along with an Additional 10% discount for other car care services during the program tenure. You also get an upfront value benefit which can be chosen (Preventive, Fresh, AC, or Hygiene Care). Along with this, you don't have to bear the cost of inflation as well. Now, the extended warranty and 5-year service for petrol cars itself cost Rs.52577 whereas My Convenience Plus package costs just Rs.46995, in diesel the same costs Rs.57232, whereas the Convenience Plus package costs only Rs.51995. So, it is definitely worth considering if you want to cover all your costs for 5 years at the time of purchase.

78, venus1975 , 19:31 ,BHPian,"<RANT> Since I am in the market for an SUV, I am seriously considering Seltos and Elevate and closely following both the threads. I understand that no car is perfect; no car can satisfy everyone, whether it costs 10 Lakh or 1 crore. However, I tend to think that Seltos is simply winning because of its looks and the long feature list. When you start looking below the skin, there are many imperfections, as I can read from the personal experiences of those who have driven the previous and current generation Seltos: 1. The ride quality is just okay - Livable. 2. Seats - front and back - support and comfort is just adequate. 6 footers are not going to feel comfortable either at the driver seat (footwell design has its flaws) or at the rear seats (average under thigh support). An SUV that does not make tall drivers or passengers happy. 2. DCT is good. but not as good as VW's DSG. DCT is as unreliable as a DSG. 3. DCT is confused in low speeds - not recommended for those who drive mostly within city limits in bumper to bumper traffic. But hey, not everyone can have two cars - one for the city and the other for the highway runs. Many use the same car for city/office commute as well as for the long family trips. 4. If I want to look beyond DCT and still enjoy the Turbo Petrol - a powerful engine that can do 0-100 in about 9 seconds - I have to pick only an iMT transmission, which is neither here nor there. There is no option of a true manual transmission with this turbo engine. 5. So, if I have to choose a Petrol engine that is reliable with a straight forward manual transmission or an IVT (CVT), I have to choose only an NA engine. But if I choose this engine, I cannot enjoy the endless list of features on offer. 6. If I want to look at the diesel, it has its own share of DPF issues. A suggested solution is to simply drive the car at high speed in an open stretch every week. So, if you are someone who is not hitting the highway every week, you have to spend 30-45 minutes and burn 5-10 Liters of Diesel every week, so your car stays clear of any DPF issues 7. Safety rating is ~3. Please pardon me if any of these observations are different from your personal experience. It is strictly based on what I have personally experienced or read in Team-bhp forums and other media reviews. I have nothing against Kia or Seltos! Seltos is still in my consideration because I know I have to choose a car that satisfies most of my non-negotiable criteria! </RANT>", 24th July 2023,kia-seltos,Chennai,146,299,Features/Controls/Displays (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Asked my wife to speed over speed breakers to feel the stiffness but nothing out of the extraordinary was noticed. Wife liked the fact that she could see the ends of the bonnet which is when the SA commented that the dashboard has been brought down due to feedback from previous gen owners.

Hello. Test drives for Turbo petrols have already begun. In Mumbai they started it on 22nd.

Firstly, IMO Diesel is here to stay for another 8-10 years looking at the current EV infrastructure.

You really need to drive it sedately (Eco mode helps) to not make the drive too jerky or unpredictable. But yes, it does shine on open roads and highways. I’m sure the 1.5 turbo will have the same driving dynamics. So if your driving requirement is more within city limits, turbo with DCT may not be the best option.

I bought the new Verna 1.5 DCT despite my low usage. Still wanted to have an option of a powerful engine with quick acceleration for occasional highway drives. Even in the city, it's a breeze to overtake or reduce the gap with the vehicle ahead. Drove it about 300km so far, all in Delhi traffic. One just needs to be patient with traffic and wait for enough gap ahead so that car can cover that crawling, without the half-brake application. Don't bother about the vehicles behind you, no one is going to fly by or save any time by closely tailgating the vehicle ahead in bumper to bumper traffic. Auto hold is a boon when coming to a standstill, it fully engages the brake to prevent any clutch slip.

Regarding the ""Safety CERTIFICATE"", I think a certificate won't be handy unless people learn to obey traffic rules. I mean let's look around, and we can see several instances of people not following traffic rules, wrong driving, and Ego driving. ULTRA High beams that tear through the eyes, 4 people on two-wheelers, Cows on the road, etc, etc. No amount of safety rating will be helpful unless traffic rules are correctly implemented, and people learn some driving manners. Many mishappenings can be prevented by proper implementation of the rules. Having a safety-rated car, and then not following/obeying traffic rules is harmful too.

It's the same for me. Don't want the hassle and headache of maintaining the paint continuously. I just wish the color combination of the GTX interiors could have been better. I'm afraid how dirty that white insert on the door arm rest is going to look in an year or two. I wish there was an option to swap GTX interiors with HTX interiors if not X line. I think the next big change in car buying is going to be when a brand gives it's consumer the option of customising as oer their wants.

Initial thoughts: - In a aggressive driving style, engine is very responsive, but does get a little loud higher on the revs. I was extremely impressed with the DCT's shift; how quick and smooth they are. I tried the paddle shifters too and was very impressed. Car feels planted - In a sedate driving style, the engine is very quiet; you can only hear the wind noise from the a.c. and ventilated seats. You barely notice the DCT shifts - The lane keeping tech and emergency braking with definitely take some getting used to; especially the lane keeping given that it adjusts constantly in your hands - The blind spot views in the cluster, ventilated seats and driving position, especially for the adjustable thigh support, (I'm 6'4"") are a huge blessing - The ISG system works really well. You can hear the starter motor slightly (this is not the same system as the Maruti SVHS, because its not got a hybrid battery. It uses DC-DC converters to re-start the engine on idle.) - You'll need a day to go through all the settings in the infotainment system considering there's so much personalization to be had. - The cabin is for sure a little claustrophobic because of the all black so the sunshade will mostly always be open The dealer told me that the GTX+ diesel should get approval this week while the petrol should be done by the end of next week, in Tamilnadu Hope it answers some fellow members' questions or at least gives some insights.", 1st August 2023,kia-seltos,"NBO,HYD,MAA",216,433,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

187, nkvyas , 20:45 ,Newbie,"I have booked the Seltos XLine Petrol DCT with the K-Code on 14-July-2023 from Automotive Kia, Hyderabad. The response was prompt from the dealership and they assigned me the SA the very next day. I was invited to the launch on 15th which was good and the XLine which was available there was the Diesel variant. Even the dealership folks weren't familiar with the new changes that came along with the facelift. The overall experience was good with the car. Personally, I would have chosen the GTX+ but the only thing I didn't like is the interior seat tubular shape & colour combination. The sage green interior of XLine is just stunning. The next day I was asked by SA to send me some docs for confirming the booking which I sent and he shared the quote and confirmed the variant. The test drive was done on Friday 28th July with GTX+ DCT Petrol Automatic. Before going with the drive experience, I'd like to share a few points about the other questions I asked and got their answers. Q1 - Is there an option for getting PPF done in KIA showroom itself? A - Yes. They have dedicated partners which does that. The SA has given my number to the person who called me and explained about the process. They quoted me 1.2 lacs for Kinght Skin Matte TPU PPF for full vehicle with 7 years warranty all over India. He also agreed to black out the chrome line on doors with Black PPF free of cost. The vehicle will be delivered to me with PPF done. I also got the quotation [1.6 lacs] from Ceramic Pro Kavaca Matte PPF. Q2 - Can I opt for BH series number? A - No. Since the Telangana govt hasn't started it. it can't be done. There might be option to get it registered in other state but I haven't explored that yet. Q3 - What Accessories are included? A - Typical stuff including mud flaps, mats, air freshener, idol etc. I asked for the foot step but apparently it's not part of accessories pkg & need to be bought separately [~15-16k] Q4 - Home Loan options with SBI are available? A - Yes. The SA gave my number to concerned person and he contacted me for all the formalities. It was pretty smooth. I just need to go to bank once to do some signatures and pay the processing fee & stamp duty [total ~9.6k]. Test Drive Experience The SA promptly schdeuled the drive and brought the car to my home. It was a GTX+ DCT Petrol. I went with one of my friend and they were two persons from showroom so total 4 people were in the car. I took a test drive for 10-15 kms approx constituting the highway, my usual routes, some bad roads. The thing which I wanted to check most is the suspension feel and comfort especially in rear seats. The driving experience gave lot of pleasure. Here are some things I like & didn't like Likes 1. Stunning looks and matte finish is just abosolute perfection. The DRLs stand out during night and rear LED tail lamps add an extra layer of premium feel. The car looks beautiful from every possible angle. 2. Ride comfort came out great. Although little on the firm side but nothing which gives u discomfort. Tried extereme pothole testing on driver & rear seat. No deal breaker for me. 3. Preimuim interior, comfortable seats with ventilation, great fit and finish, ergonomically placed buttons are ergonomically placed. Paddle shifters feels sturdy and responsive. 4. ADAS is welcome addition with plethora of features to keep the driving safe and tech savvy. 5. Panaromic sunroof is another worthy addition which makes the whole cabin a lot roomier with the dark interiors. 6. Bright and responsive touchscreen & instrument cluster, dual zone AC is chiller, music system is pretty nice. 7. The ride was good and even with 4 persons in the car, there was no shortage of power. DCT was pretty responsive on both auto & manual modes. Dislikes 1. Cost cutting on wiper blades, manual fuel lid opener feels cheap considering the premium package of 20+ lacs. 2. NVH levels could have been better but has a sporty grunt which will not bother. Maybe used a better Yoko tyres for better tyre noise reduction. Currently using Yoko BluEarth which are very silent and provides nice grip. 3. ADAS can be a bit aggressive which sometimes is a little uncomfortable. Would have been better if there was an option to set the sensitivity. Now the biggest dilemma I am in is whether to buy the car in Telangana and pay 2% [~40k] extra tax as there is another vehicle [bike] on my name or get it from my hometown [MP]. I am also preferring a BH series number which is not available in Telangana. I have reached out to Kia dealers in my hometown to get more details on this.

Ask him for VIN details of your car and booking receipt. Also please disburse payments after doing PDI thoroughly. Team BHP's PDI checklist is the perfect thing to carry.

Ceramic coating will help you prevent normal wear and tear. Normal scratches, swirl marks and small chips and dents, but deep scratches will require correction. Also since you're buying an X-Line I doubt you'll have a lot of options for ceramic since matt colour is really tough to maintain. Also ceramic pro does ceramic and PPF both together, they'll first apply ceramic coating and then put on PPF hence adding an extra layer of protection. If your budget doesn't permit, you can go for ceramic coating and get your car repainted every 1-2 years. My venue too has been ceramic coated.

212, ashvek3141 , 20:08 ,BHPian,"Had a quick look at the 2023 Kia Seltos GTX+ D AT & here are my impressions regarding the same. Our official review has some amazing pictures of the car , hence I didn't bother to click any. There will be a few comparisons done with the Sonet D AT as well as my current ride, the 1st-gen Creta P MT. Some might even seem like an apples to oranges; however, all em are are purely personal (in no particular order). First up, the looks! The car looks beautiful. I always liked the looks of the earlier Seltos and the newer one looks even better. I have seldom come across anyone who doesn't like the way it looks. Nonetheless, it's still subjective. The car was GTX+ D AT in the new Pewter Olive shade and I quite liked it. However, I still feel Seltos looks the best in White! The seating of car is a little lower than the 1st-gen Creta as I had to 'bend down' a little to get into it. My dad too commented the same. For reference we are 6' and 5' 7"" respectively. Contrary to popular opinion, I felt the doors on a lighter side, while the bonnet is quite heavy. Overall sheet metal quality is decent and so is the paint quality. Once seated the interiors felt of good quality with pretty good fit and finish. The ones in the Sonet feel a notch lower IMHO. Having said that, I still maintain that the 1st-gen Creta had a superior fit and finish. My Creta is 8 years now and there isn't a single squeak or rattle. *touchwood*. The driver's seat has a good amount of adjustments and finding a comfortable driving position is very easy as in the case with most of the Hyundai / Kia cars. The interior scheme of GTX+ is all black including the roof liner which IMO makes the cabin feel a tad claustrophobic. However, on opening the massive panoramic sunroof things get a little better with a good amount of light entering the cabin. As majority of them commented, the GTX+ deserved a better interior scheme. Alas, they could have just carried over the one of the earlier Seltos. That black roof liner was just not needed. The sunroof also results in slightly lesser headroom. The space at the back is okay; nothing to write home about. Since, the car is identical in length there is no improvement here and Creta has way better rear seating than the Seltos. My knees rub against the hard plastics of the front seats with the driver seat set to my driving position. Two 6 footers back to back would be at average comfort! Driving the Diesel Automatic, First up, there is a significant difference in the way the Sonet D AT and the Seltos D AT drive. The acceleration in the Sonet was brisk, just a slight tap on the A pedal used to move the car. You could actually feel the throttle. And the SPORT mode was explosive altogether!! It was such a fun to drive the Sonet D AT. Seltos on the other hand, felt a bit mellowed down IMO. The acceleration was plain linear and it lacked the 'push' or the throttle that of the Sonet. The Sonet always felt engaging to drive, whereas Seltos was just about okay. Don't get me wrong, the car is good and has decent grunt too, just that the Sonet felt 2-3 notches better in terms of performance. I wonder whether this is the additional weight of the Seltos, and if so than would it make such a huge difference? Or is it that the BS6 Phase 2 engines have been mellowed down altogether. Even the difference between the NORMAL and the SPORT mode was barely felt. Sonet on the other hand, used to lurch forward when you switch to SPORT mode with the accelerator pressed. The in-gear acceleration in the Seltos too felt average at best. I could also feel some kind of 'whining' noise when I depressed the A pedal. Not sure what exactly it was. But everytime I pressed the A pedal, it was noticeable. I didn't test all the ADAS features as such ; however, I did check the Lane keep assist, blind spot monitoring, etc. to name a few. I can confirm that all these features work great! At least in the moderate Goa traffic. In fact, I felt they were much better than the one's I checked in the XUV7OO. Having said that, there's a lot of buzzing and stuff when these features are kept ON. Will take sometime getting used to. The horn of the Seltos is toned down against the one in earlier Seltos and the Sonet. Sadly, it ain't great. The horn pad too makes irritating clicking noise each time you press. It's worse than the one in the Sonet. 1st-gen Creta has THE BEST sounding wind-tone horn amongst the Hyundai / Kia cars. Period. The brakes have a good bite and the cars stops exactly where you want it too. Thanks to the discs all-around The much talked about ride quality of the Seltos - I'm happy to report that the ride quality of the new Seltos is quite compliant. Our TD car had tire pressures at 42 - 45 psi!! This, coupled with 18 inchers, yet the ride quality was very very compliant. I even took the car over some bad patches and the car performed well! I don't see any reason to complaint about the ride if the tire pressures are kept between 32-33 psi. Good that Kia got this sorted finally. The handling of the car is good too and doesn't wallow or anything. I think the earlier Seltos used to handle well too. So no surprises there. The in-cabin insulation is great and as expected definitely better than the Sonet due to the good sound damping materials used. It's only when you rev hard, some noise is filtered inside the cabin. But than, it's not all that bad. The sunroof cover is quite noisy I felt. Having said that, the cover felt of good quality and helps to restrict the light, unlike the one seen in the Hyryder / Grand Vitara. The new infotainment system is very fluidic and a delight to use. It has some new features too. The instrument cluster too has great graphics and fluidic. The 8-speaker BOSE sound system is good, nothing that 'wows' you as such. Dual-Zone AC works as intended and chills the cabin in no time. However, I did feel the compressor cutting down when revved hard. This wasn't the case in the Sonet and it maintained the cabin temperature irrespective how you drove the car. I found the seat ventilation to be just about okay. I expected it to be a bit more better , at least at the highest setting. The current wait times are ranging between 4-5 months for the GTX+ for which they've received the maximum bookings. Not sure how true this figure is though. Overall, it's a pretty decent car and will surely 'wow' you if you're upgrading from a segment lower. If you ask me, having owned the 1st-gen Creta for over 8 years, it's doesn't quite seem like an upgrade to me per se. I do understand that they're from the same segment , so ideally it wouldn't. But than the gap is nearly 8 long years and for sure cars have come a long way since. The price increase too is significant! Even than I felt that my Creta is good for another 2-3 years. Sure, it misses greatly on the latest and the greatest feature set, but pure mechanical stuff or the basics; I think the 1st-gen Creta owners wouldn't complaint much.", 3rd August 2023,kia-seltos,Goa,783,"2,216",Features/Controls/Displays (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

PPF is too expensive and but how effective is Ceramic coating? If one has to do it every 6 months, I don't see any point in it either. Ceramic coating is a good option. I too have booked a Black Seltos GTX+ and I'm getting it ceramic coated outside. My cousin manages a detailing studio and I had spoken to him about Ceramic coats and everything. He said that you don't need to do it every 6 months, if the dealership says they do it every 6 months, they'll simply wax your car and give it to you and you'll feel its coated. Ceramic coating is done with a couple of layers and after a year if you feel that the shine is gone or something, you can have it polished and coated one more time. Usually Ceramic holds up for 2-3 years. Post that you can do it again. I found it cost friendly. PPF on an average costs 80,000-1,00,000. You can get your car Ceramic coated every year for 4 years in same price.

240, headbanger , 15:04 ,BHPian,"I had pre-booked Seltos on 14 July using K-code. But was struggling to get the test drive due to below average dealership experience. Finally was able to get a 7 km test drive. Test Drive Model: Seltos Petrol DCT GTX+ Test Drive mix: 75% highway + 25% city Existing Primary Car: Type 1 Maruti Dzire Petrol and Ritz Petrol (both 1.2K engine). Other existing cars in family include Sonet D AT GTX+, Seltos D AT HTK+, 2019 Swift P Vxi, Toyota Innova and Polo 1.6 TDI. I have driven all these cars for more than minimum 5k each. So I know a bit of these cars and the intent of sharing this information is that any new experience is relative to what you already know. What may seem as brutal acceleration to me may be tamed linear acceleration to someone with an entirely different garage composition. Coming back to the topic, here are my observations: Good: + Exterior looks. Enough said. + The quality of interiors. That adjustable shutter just reeks quality. The dashboard looks slick. Gear lever is a joy to hold. + Electric seat adjustment. Superb!!! + Paddle shifters were pure joy. Gear Lag- what is that? + Mid range and those paddle shifters. D4,5,6 are fun if you play with those shifters. + Slick infotainment system. That screen is the cleanest implementation in sub 20L range. + High speed stability. I touched 120kmph and it can go all day long without breaking a sweat. The car masks speed as well so you don't feel nervous. Straight line stability is top notch. Average: - Elephant in the room is ride quality on those 18 inchers. It's stiff. TPMS in the test drive car showed 36psi all around. Don't get me wrong here. The ride quality is not harsh in these new vehicles, but it's stiff and you will feel every patch work on the road. Since my primary ride is comparatively softly sprung, I could immediately notice the difference. If I end up buying GTX+, the first thing that will happen is tyre swap to UC6 or a softer tire set. - Both previous iterations of Sonet and Seltos are stiff and the ride quality becomes progressively harsher as the tires become hard with time. The result is that these cars have to get new shoes in quicker span of time. To conclude, the ride is stiff, you feel everything under the tire albeit in an acceptable manner. My humble Dzire irons out the expansion joints on flyovers at 100kmph. Seltos will need to be slowed down over those expansion joints. - The 1.5 turbo engine is not brutal - it's linear. Let me explain!!! I already have tasted Diesel Auto in my existing garage. That 115bhp motor can put much bigger combos to shame. It's not the number of horses that the motor has, it's how it puts it to wheels. In my experience, Sonet D AT triumphs Seltos D AT even in existing avatar. It pushes you back the moment you press the pedal. However, this 1.5GDI doesn't do that on its own unless you want it to. Put the car is Sports mode and use those paddle shifters. That's where the joy is!!! The downside is that unlike diesel motor, this joy mode will kill your mileage in the petrol motor. - To conclude, unless you are living in NCR and have even 40% regular highway travel to take care of DPF issues, my suggestion will be to pick that 115 diesel over 160 petrol. It's the best of both worlds. - Why not have memory functions for driver seat? Ask anyone where one car is shared by multiple drivers. Kia has already put in electric adjustment of seats. Just add memory function to make the functionality complete. - In the same vein, with so much of personalization on offer on ADAS related functionality, why not add Driver Profile in the infotainment. While I may want ADAS to be fully active when my wife is behind the wheels since she is new to driving, I may not want to get all ding dong tones when I am driving. Another use case can be of different settings when one is driving on highways versus in City. Just change the driver profile to select what all features you want to be working instead of hearing those tones at the slightest flick of steering. - Last but not the least, I didn't like the color choice for GTX+. Black roof with black seats that look inferior to even HTX variant did take some shine away from what is a beautiful cabin. Put those sage greens in GTX+ and replace the black roof liner with beige one. - The same Bose music system works well in Sonet due to smaller cabin as compared to bigger cabins of Seltos and Carens. I noticed the same thing when I test drove Carens during its launch. The music sounds above average at best. Don't expect too much. Next Action: I will also test drive Seltos HTX IVT. Let's see where I land. I am unable to push myself for even seeing Elevate. If Seltos IVT ends up being a mixed bag overall, that may just push me to bring Elevate in picture.

Points in favour of Elevate - - Realibility, ASS, tried and tested engine. - Biggest wheelbase giving more legroom and boot space. - Will age well mechanically.

Wow! 13.5 years with a vtec motor. Any upgrade from your existing car will feel like youre entering a new world full of connected car tech. You have summed it up nicely. IMO engine wise the elevate wont feel like an upgrade. But the SUV body style and the ICE will feel new and refreshing. On the other hand the Seltos will feel like a whole new package. Also, Hyundai Kia engines are equally reliable as well. I have a 10 year old i20 that runs buttery smooth till date. Some more information on your usecase would be beneficial.

It's the best of both worlds. Next Action: I will also test drive Seltos HTX IVT. Let's see where I land. I am unable to push myself for even seeing Elevate. If Seltos IVT ends up being a mixed bag overall, that may just push me to bring Elevate in picture. But at the moment, its Seltos IVT HTX versus Seltos GTX+ DCT. The tyres are not going to help you with stiff suspension. It would make the difference, but marginally. Do not expect a plush ride if suspension is stiff.

I would rate it way higher than any other car I have owned till date, including Fiat Linea (which was known for plush rides).

Softer tires will just reduce the harshness a bit. Can't pitch for Citroen primarily because it doesn't offer automatic which is a must have for me. And while I wish Citroen to succeed in India, I will not chance 20L with a ten year perspective on a brand with fledgling presence in India. When it comes to cars, I shop for bluechip brands with low downside in India. Slightly controversial strategy but works for me. As for Elevate, lets see. My first instinct to the car was meh. But as they say, never say never. If I am able to get hands on display vehicle before mid September, I will try to evaluate it with open mind. Truth be told, the only other car which feels as complete as Seltos is XUV7OO. Though its adding to cost, but that 200bhp petrol engine mated with TC, good safety rating and a plush interior with similar feature set makes it a well rounded package.

248, neel911 , 09:15 ,BHPian,"I test drove the 1.5L Turbo Petrol GTX+ Seltos and Taigun 1.5GT DSG back to back (both the showrooms are next to each other). I was behind the wheels and my wife was seated on rear. Few observations: - The Taigun felt more sturdy (even when you open the door) and planted during drive - I found 1.5DSG better than the 1.5Turbo Petrol on Seltos in terms of gear shifts - Wife found the ride on stiffer side (similar to our 10 year old Honda City) on Seltos. She did not complain much on the Taigun - Lot of times I found the Seltos a bit confused when trying to accelerate. It did not inspire same level of confidence as VW - Interior is where Seltos wins hands down. Taigun was pretty much crossed off in the interior segment and the premium feel when driving back to back especially when you are shelling close to 25L OTR Bangalore (both are more or less same for top trim). - Until I opened the pano sunroof (just the shade cover), Seltos did not feel that roomy. Post that it was comfortable. The black roof lining does not help at all when shades are covered Overall left with mixed feelings. The smile I got during driving VW 1.5 is not what I felt during the 1.5 Turbo Petrol on Seltos and the ride was somehow more stiff than Taigun.

Really have doubts on the aging of Kia, since with so many screens, sensors etc. how it will keep up with wear and tear? I believe if it's only the reliability bit you are confused about, the 1.5 NA on Hyundai/Kia should be equally reliable. I have seen the 1.2 NA being reliable for about 13 years in my friend's I20, and the 1.5 NA should be the same. Regarding the screens and sensors, these got nothing to do with engine IMO. You can always turn off a few sensors since you have the option to, incase you find it bothersome. Regarding screens and their reliability, these screens are best in business. If we can't rely on these, there's hardly anyone else to rely on. I would also say the Seltos atleast offers you these screens, the competition does not. That said, Elevate test drive vehicles should be available soon. I would suggest do test drive it once atleast, since you would be putting down a significant amount of money, it's always prudent to try out all the available options.

Essentially, the dispatch vehicle from the factory has higher tyre pressure to avoid flat spots on the tyres as the vehicle is stationary during loading and transport. The dealers don't re-set the tyre pressure at the stock yards as the vehicle is stationary there too for few days before it is made available at showroom for test drives.

Hence the GTX+. TPU PPF for 85,000 is a low number as far as the local shops around me are concerened. They all quoted 1-1.2L for the Seltos (even with the new Pana sunroof saving a lot of film.) So I don't expect the 85000 one to be of good quality. I wouldn't want to cheapen out and then have my paint chipped or etc. anyway. I also picked up the Dr. Beasley kit for Matte cars and returned it (was in the US a week ago), since we decided against the X-Line. My father and I were ready to repaint the car every 2 years instead of TPU. My mom has wanted a Red car for our past 2 (Creta and Cruze) and I always overrode her on that. This time, since I will only get to enjoy the car for a few weeks before leaving, I let her have her colour of choice . Personally, I prefer White > Dark Grey > Red, but dad said no to the Grey.

292, thesilentone , 10:46 ,BHPian,"Happy to inform all of you that I have taken delivery of the GTX+ DCT turbo petrol Aurora Black Pearl on Friday. I wont be able to do justice to an ownership review, so I will post a short review after I have driven for a few days and after getting the hang of things since there are so many features that are new to me and I need to get used to them. My Creta diesel automatic had crossed one lakh kilometres and was looking for a change to a petrol vehicle for slightly better ease of driving. I had test driven and booked the earlier Seltos GTX+ DCT model in January and had informed the showroom that I will take delivery only after April when the new CAFÉ norms kick in. I expected the new Seltos to be launched in April to coincide with the new norms. However, come April, the new Seltos was nowhere in sight and finally was launched in July. My booking was converted to the new model and I received the booking docket mentioning the tentative delivery date as 22nd September. However, about 15 days back I was pleasantly surprised to receive a call from my service advisor that my car was allotted. I was still in two minds whether to go ahead with the purchase since I was not very happy with the ride quality when travelling in a friends Seltos and also the fact that the car now came with 18 inch wheels which I assumed will further affect the ride quality. Before the price announcement, I even considered changing the booking to HTX+ mainly due to the 17 inch wheels and better interior colour scheme since I was not interested in the ADAS suite. However, I would certainly miss the 360 degree camera but made peace with it. I did not like the alloy wheel design in the HTX+ and I thought I can change the alloy wheels to the earlier GTX+ 17 inch alloy wheels. I was in for a rude shock after the price announcement. I was expecting the price difference between the GTX+ and HTX + to be at least Rs.1,25,000/- to Rs.1,50,000/- considering the feature difference, but the on road difference in price was just Rs.72,000/- and if I was to change the alloys, it would practically end up with almost the same pricing of the GTX+ without having the features of the GTX+. It did not make sense and hence I retained the booking as it is. Though I am a normally sedate driver, there are instances where I enjoy short bursts of speed and hence I wanted a car which was more powerful than my Creta diesel. The only options in my price range were the Volkswagen twins and the Seltos. I really love the design of the Kushaq but each time I plan to take a test drive, reports of the ac kept holding me back. Ac is a non negotiable for the hot weather in Chennai and so I ended up with the Seltos. The RTO approval for the GTX+ came only on 5th August and after the normal formalities, took delivery. I couldnt do the PDI since I was continuously travelling and could not spare the time. Hope everything is fine and everything works as intended.

Firstly, many congratulations on ya new ride! With regards to the 18"" wheels, be rest assured that Kia has worked on the suspension for the facelift model and I found the ride to be way better than the earlier Seltos riding on the 17 inchers. Moreover, my TD car i.e. the GTX+ was having tires pressures set above 40 psi!! I would suggest you to play around the pressures in the range of 32 - 34 psi and see what suits best for your requirements.

But at the moment, its Seltos IVT HTX versus Seltos GTX+ DCT. Finally, I managed to get test drive of Seltos IVT and GTX+ DCT back to back today. The first prominent difference is ride quality. Seltos IVT rides plusher as compared to stiffer GTX+ DCT. This point alone is a blocker for GTX+ DCT in my use case. I don't know if this is due to different tunes of suspension in these two variants or may be due to different tire sizes, the ride quality in GTX+ suffers. Every undulation, expansion joints were felt in the cabin in GTX+. The second difference is the interior ambience. While Seltos IVT felt livelier, GTX+ DCT felt dark and claustrophobic. I still feel this black combo theme should have been kept for a special edition rather than GTX+ model. The difference between the engine and transmission combo is chalk and cheese for these two models. Seltos IVT is super silent, extremely refined but isn't one which can be used for aggressive drives. Use CVT in a non aggressive manner and that's where this variant shines. 0-120kmph is doable on this variant albeit with patience. It's reasonably quick but is not fast by any standards. GTX+ DCT is a very different combo. It can gun to 120kmph in no time and can run at higher throttle all day long. You can run this combo in conservative or aggressive manner and the car responds. The downside is mileage though if you want to have fun. Personally, for my use case, IVT won over DCT variant primarily because of ride quality and to some extent, interior ambience. While I would have loved to have the reserve power and all those features in GTX+, the ride quality with those 18 inchers just killed my interest.", 17th August 2023,kia-seltos,Gurgaon,552,"1,544",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Upon consulting one of the two dealers they presented me an unrealistic demand that in addition to have offices in 4 different states, one has to be in the state where the registration is being done which is not a requirement as per the rules. The other dealer didn't have this but he insisted on having the local city address proof. I had to finally make some calls to my local RTO to make sure I can get the BH registration done after purchasing the car from other city. After calling in some favours from friends I got the confirmation that it can be done. Then I reached out to the dealer explained the whole situation that I just need the car from you with all the necessary paperwork and I will take care of registration myself. They were hesitant and asked me that in case of any penalties (1% of the ex showroom if registration is not done within a week) they won't be responsible. I agreed and they finally took the booking.

This was my second TD for GTX+DCT and on both occasions I felt the same observations that I shared. An important point worth mentioning is that my current ride is the age old Type1 Dzire which is softly sprung and is running on fresh UC6 tires. Hence my relative experience on both variants of Seltos is with that perspective. For someone coming from another car perspective, Seltos GTX+ DCT may be an acceptable experience.

Felt more expensive, and the sunroof not sure how it balances the car and the lifespan. The GV is practically perfect for city, and weekend drives with good mileage and service. The ground clearance and suspension is very good. However, cabin is not too wide, and the sunroof shade is so flimsy and transparent. The cost is also expensive.

I would suggest you to go for the Seltos. It is one handsome looking car and has got all the bells and whistles you need from the car and the drive quality has been made better. Also if you find the cabin less wide, you can go with the Creta as well. For some reason the Creta feels more spacious than the Seltos.

My first impression/observations: # Cabin feels premium, although black interiors make it appear small, the sunroof compensates for it. I wish Kia provided the option of brown interiors of HTX+ in GTX+ too. # Ventilated seats work, can evaluate better after a long drive. I am one of those who would end up with sweaty back within half an hour of driving, sitting on leatherette seats. I really wish these seats would be a boon for me. # NVH levels are good, very good at slow speeds, a little noticeable at higher speeds but still ok. # Bose speakers are just above average, even after trying multiple ways to tune the sound output, it didn't wow me or my wife. # Tyre pressures are 38-40 psi, wanted to reduce to 35 but decided to try with those for a while. Small bumps were not very noticeable, however, larger humps required slowing down. The stiffness is definitely present but at lower tyre pressures, I guess, it will be manageable. NOTE: my only other experience driving on Indian roads has been my 10-year old i10 and a Thar. I'll add more when I go for a longer drive and at higher speeds.

Applicable to all SUV designed cars in the segment. My comments with XL6 are purely from a long term ownership perspective. Except the S Cross and Brezza, most Maruti cars suffer from long term durability test. By this I don't mean the engine-gearbox combo(these will easily outlast a decade), but by the general materials used elsewhere. Rattles creep up all around in just about 10-15K kms of driving, plastics start losing there sheen, suspensions to wear out quicker than similarly priced competitors. There's also the horrible non self centering steering which is a basic safety feature, absent in most Maruti cars (not sure if issue persists in XL6). Read more Here (Why the heck will Maruti-Suzuki not fix its defective & dangerous steering behaviour?) Seltos commands a premium because of the SUVish design, upmarket interiors, excellent refinement and relatively better build quality.

This is slightly OT but I would like to understand how the comments in this forum influence the decisions/thought process of the fellow BHP-ians.Have you ever changed the stock Tyres when you purchased your previous cars or regretted not changing them? Have you been contemplating a Tyre change for the Seltos ever since you came to know the size/brand of the stock Tyres it comes with? Were you unhappy with the ride/handling when you test-drove Seltos and thought that a Tyre change would improve the ride/handling? Or, it is just that you have been influenced by some of the discussions around changing the brand/size of the stock Tyres, and so decided to follow suit?

Circa 2010, we got a new Ritz with JK Tornado tires and for the 47k kms, we all felt that we should have bought something else. The ride quality was that bad. Changed the tires to XM1+ and the ride quality difference in before/after Michelins was like day and night. Ever since then, all cars in our garage have only seen Michelins, Yokos or the latest UC6.

For me last year i bought a Kiger which came with CEAT's from factory. The car had power but i was missing the handling and braking was worrysome. After 3000 kms i changed over to Michelin's and it was a day & night difference right from the moment i drove of with new tyres. So once you experience by yourself the change then you will understand. But some cars do come with good tyres right from factory itself, then you won't need to upgrade for sure. UPDATE GUYS Have got the delivery and straight away headed to the tyre shop. Checked both the Conti's & Yoko's for few minutes. Found Conti's were bit softer than Yoko's, Both the tyres had different design of treads and Yoko's being wider had a rating of 98V vs 95H of Conti's. Though the Conti's had mention of Treadwear, Traction & Temperature ratings which were absent in the Yoko's. Apart from these nothing major differences as sidewall and tyres had similar amount of layers of materials(nylon,polyster,steel etc) Hence finally went with the Yoko's as it's a bigger tyre and will be added advantage in drivability.

431, thesilentone , 11:47 ,BHPian,"Hi all. After my last weekend trip to Pondy, I couldnt update the thread immediately and could do so now only. Please note that any comparison mentioned is only with my first gen Creta diesel AT. The drive was actually a little tedious with very heavy traffic both ways due to murtham dates, especially the Chennai to Tindivanam stretch. Due to this, I could not turn on the ADAS features and also couldnt try the cruise control or paddle shifters. The Tindivanam to Pondy stretch was however with moderate traffic and could finally free the legs. Wow. The car picks up speed effortlessly in the normal mode and we notice the speed only after the constant beeps keeps reminding us that we should slow down. There is a definite difference we can feel in the various drive modes. The eco mode is useful only in crawling traffic for city drives. On the highway, normal mode is fine most of the time. For the moments when we want to put the foot down, sports mode is where the fun is. The tachometer dances to the tune of the acceleration and since the car is still in the running in period, I limited the use of the sports mode to only a few minutes at a time. Waiting for another highway drive after the running in period. With regard to the ride quality, I stand corrected from my initial impression. On normal roads, the car is really smooth and a absolute joy to drive. On broken roads however, the smooth ride gives way to some jarring moments and the Creta shod with Continental UC6 tyres certainly is more composed on those stretches. UC6 tyres on the Seltos could make the drive on bad roads better but I think that I will make the switch when the time comes for a change in tyres since it is not so worrisome as to do so immediately. Another aspect I find better in the Creta is the position of the button on the gear shifter. The button at the back of the shifter in the Creta falls to place in my hand more easily than the Seltos which has the button on the side. Though it is something which I will get used to, the back seems to be the more logical location. In the Creta, I used to always use the hand brake while stopping at a signal. In the Seltos, the absence of the hand brake lever sometime makes my hand fish for the lever at the signal. Auto hold is a real boon in traffic. The minor downside is that the creep function does not work and in combination with the idle start stop function, we need to apply the correct amount of pressure to prevent a hard take off. Idle start stop function works unobtrusively and no harm in gaining a few sips of petrol. Idle start function cannot be disabled permanently but can be switched off whenever required at the start or during travel. Apple Car Play as known to all is only with the wired option and connects quite effortlessly with the USB cable. Google maps can be used split screen as well as the whole screen and is really nice. I still have not used any other feature with Car Play. The wireless charger works well and the cooling function did prevent the phone from heating up. Full marks. I was initially a little unsure whether I had placed the phone properly and whether the phone was being charged, but later noticed that the charging indicator was lit up. I generally only listen to FM radio while driving and for the FM channels, the Bose speakers did sound good to the ears. Only musical connoisseurs can comment on the actual performance for other modes of music. There is something call mood lighting with various colour options for the ambient lighting. In this, there is an option for the lighting to dance with the music and the cabin converts into a theatre. Really Kia. Initially I was a little worried about the dark seats and the dark roof, but from the drivers seat, I dont even notice them. My family members on the rear seat were busy chatting and I wont be surprised if they didnt even know in which car they travelled so someone who has travelled and noticed things from the rear should comment. The seats however are slightly on the firmer side, probably due to the ventilation system. I would have liked a little more cushioning to the seats, but not a deal breaker. Coming to the seat ventilation, it works decently and is a nice feel good feature to have. The 360 degree camera is really nice with good resolution and so also the reverse parking camera and blind spot monitors. We get a red coloured indicator on the side mirrors when any object comes into the blind spot area with audible beeps. Nice to have safety feature. Dual zone ac is also a good feature to have. I wont have to keep adjusting the temperature when my co passenger feels cold or vice versa. To each passenger, his own. I havent opened the sunroof even once and most likely am not going to open it at all except probably to show someone that it is present in this car. In my opinion, sunroofs should only be sold as an option in India but when did any manufacturer give us only what we want? There is no way we can avoid the forced add ons. The sliding compartment in between the front seats houses two cup holders and the sliding action is sheer class but unfortunately one slot is used for the perfume and the other for hand sanitizer, so I cannot really close the compartment. Another nice feature added to the list of unused items. Premium dual layer mats by Kia has reduced the space on the dead pedal and it is not convenient to place the foot fully on it. I would advise buyers to personally check it out before ticking it in the accessories list. Overall, a big thumbs up to Kia. I am really glad with my purchase and hope that it provides me with the same hassle free ownership as my Creta which has served me well for more than a hundred thousand kilometres and almost 8 years of ownership without any major issues.", 26th August 2023,kia-seltos,Chennai,266,326,"Steering, Handling or Ride",Very Positive

I received a call from the dealership 3 days ago that my car will arrive today and it did but it wasn't the car alloted by kia(which I wrongly thought it was)as the booking docket's status didn't changed when i checked online after coming back home The kia dealership here refused the delivery if I don't take insurance from them and asked me to wait for my car to be alloted by KIA. They said this was arranged by them and if I want delivery I'd have to buy insurance along with it.. Looks like I'll have to wait another 25 days because I am not going to get robbed by them in the name of insurance. I assume they would be helpless and won't be able to rob me if the car has been alloted by kia and it's their duty to provide the car.

Last September, first I booked the Toyota Hyryder Full Hybrid. Around January, they offered my Variant and Colour but with full accessories ( claiming it was billed to another client with accessories so I too could only buy accordingly).l let the offer pass and waited till March/April. Then booked the Maruti GV by cancelling Toyota booking. This was allotted in 2 months but again with the accessory rider. I cancelled that too when I booked the Kia Seltos IVT and kept in mind that I had to let go of myself if I wanted something. Finally my Pewter Green IVT HTX will be delivered within 2-3 days with a reduced accessory list( Mats, Sunshades, Door Visors and a few here and there which I actually wanted but along with Ceramic Coating from the dealer.) In all 3 cases I was ok with Insurance from the dealer. So yes, I have paid an official premium to get my allotment. All 3 dealers are from Mumbai and to top it, my driver who has a side hustle of tourist vehicles tells me that when a yellow number plate car is to be purchased, dealers are mandating accessories much more than 25,000/- for ready allotments or else wait indefinitely ( for cars like Wagon R/Ertiga).", 30th August 2023,kia-seltos,Mumbai,549,704,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Positive

All is well and the registration formalities are in process and the car is going to be delivered by this Saturday 02/09. My dealer (Kia Malad - Mumbai) originally tried to give me another car a few weeks back with all the accessories and with insurance through them, saying these are already billed to this particular car. However I said no and told them to allocate to somebody else. I will wait and take only things I need and nothing more. I took insurance directly from my old agent, saved 32k even after all the possible add-ons. The only thing I did before buying insurance was spoke to their insurance guy at the service centre to check which all companies do they have cashless facilities with and opted for one of them. Took only about 5 accessories which I want and nothing more, told him to not push this 25k business to me. I think the trick here is to be in constant touch with your dealer and keep politely checking with them every couple of days. I kept majority of my conversation through email even after they confirmed something over whatsapp. I also had a few senior member's email ids from the dealers team so marked them all in all my conversations every time. I kept asking them what is my booking's waiting number at their dealership for my particular variant booked. I think the booking status on the website is pretty useless, my car has been registered now and the status on the website still shows - ""Booked'. I think the status is updated after getting instructions from the the dealer itself, who also often forget to inform Kia India to update.

484, Schroeter , 16:34 ,Newbie,"This is primarily a rant on the variant choices provided by Kia! I have been driving a Jazz since 2012 and have been more than happy with it, but with time there has been an itch to move to a new car and considering our road conditions (and family's aspirations) I have been hunting for a CSUV. Everyone in the family agrees that look/feature wise Kia Seltos is the car we should go for. I primarily drive in Bangalore's B2B traffic (monthly less than 500 km) with occasional highway jaunts (annually less than 1000 km). My brain says go for the HTX IVT variant but it seems to lack a lot of the features that my family likes in GTX+ variant plus IVT is just OK for highways. My heart says go for the GTX+ variant which is great in terms of features (and engine+transmission) but also comes with the risk of DCT issue/failure. Does the HTX+ IMT T-GDI sound like a good compromise wherein I get to enjoy the turbo petrol while still having a more reliable and relatively convenient transmission in the form of IMT? But then I think about it, by paying less than a lakh I can upgrade from HTX+ to GTX+ and get ADAS, 360 cam etc.! Ahh this is so frustrating, why couldn't Kia release a high end version with IVT! The Elevate does come with ADAS but misses out on a lot of features. I'm not considering the German twins as of now considering the various non-DSG issues that owners have reported. Hyryder hybrid has a really long wait time. GV/Hyryder interiors also feel like a step below.

My current ride is Honda Amaze SMT Diesel, which has been run over 1.5 lakh kms in just about 10 years (Will be 10 years on November 1st 2023). Unfortunately NCR rules do not allow me to keep it beyond 10 years. Good: * Exterior looks - Awesome. * Quality of Interiors - Just Great. * Electric seat adjustment. Superb!!! Though I wish there was a memory option on seats. * Paddle shifters were pure joy. There is absolutely no Gear Lag. D4,5,6 are fun while playing with those shifters. * Slick infotainment system. The screen is the cleanest implementation in sub 20L range. * ADAS looked great with special mention to the turn cameras. Average: * The ride quality on those 18 inchers seemed a bit stiff. TPMS in the test drive car showed 38 psi all around. SA said the tyres coming on GTX+ were either Bridgestone or Goodyear - not sure which is better. Do I need to change it in future? My current running is not much, mostly city driving and once a quarter outstations (read highways) * I didn't like the color choice for GTX+ per se. Black roof with black seats that look nice to me, but the sage greens from X-Line would have been better. * Kia should have kept the HUD in the GTX which I will sorely miss. * The Bose music system worked well - though not expecting much. It will be only used when I am driving alone. If I have my Mom in the car, then it will not be used. Bluetooth connectivity was seamless for me (atleast) - hope the new car will have the same.

497, Highh5 , 12:19 ,BHPian,"A colleague of mine recently picked up HTX+ iMT Diesel in Imperial Blue. Honestly, I was not a big fan of earlier Seltos but this one changed my stance on this car to a large extent. My comparison will be with my Harrier which I've been driving for the last 2 years and 9 months and completed 42000 km on that. What I liked: Neatly integrated, High-resolution, sleek Dual Screens, one for infotainment and another for instrumentation console. Specifically the way they have integrated, they don't block the view of the dashboard, really love the integration/implementation. Camel Brown Leatherette Seats with a nice touch on the Dashboard and door area lit up the entire cabin and gave an exquisite feeling. A lot of excellent additions such as Dual Zone Climate Control, Ambient Lightning, electric seats, and Front Parking Sensors don't make me feel that I'm missing something even though GTX+ and X-Line models are also present on top of that. No one can beat Koreans when it comes to features. I like the steering wheel as well, light, perfectly sized and all the buttons look upmarket in comparison to my Harrier Steering wheel. The front seats are nice, with good under-thigh support as well. Honestly, it's better than Harrier specifically the under-thigh support. Love the DRLs of both the front and rear lights. Car looks smart and stands out in the crowd. I drove the iMT for the very first time, and somehow love the way it is implemented. There was minimal lag in comparison to the Automatic Harrier I drive, which is no slouch either. Found Seltos diesel refined, peppy, and very easy to chuck around the city in comparison to Harrier. The engine is not only peppy and fun to drive but at the same time fuel efficient as well. Not the case with a bigger 2.0-liter Kyrotec engine, either you can have fun or have mileage. What I don't like: The quality of the Roof liner is very poor. A couple of dry clean washes and it is gone. Roof Liner of Harrier is miles ahead, properly knitted high-quality fabric. Headroom is very limited considering if one raises the driver seat to their highest seat adjustment. Harrier doesn't have any such problem Even though the knee room is good, under thigh support of the rear seats is not good in comparison to my Harrier. Ventilated Seats are more like a gimmick, didn't find them that effective. Space - One of the major reasons I didn't buy this car and instead bought the Harrier. Specifically, boot space looks decent on paper but is not a great implementation in real. Sitting three people in the rear is gonna be a tight affair. Safety is still a big question. Now don't quote me that Harrier is also not tested but I believe everyone is aware of what Harrier is capable of. High window lines and at the same time window size is small as well, made me feel claustrophobic initially at the rear seats. However, the Panoramic Sunroof helped a lot and made me feel at ease. Again, my reference point here was Harrier, its large glass area makes the cabin feel more lit and airy. Will I prefer to buy this car in the future: Yes, I can. Really love the interiors, feels upmarket. Waiting for the facelifted Harrier and how it stacks against the competition. The only thing that can keep me away from this Car is the Bharat NCAP results.

You can go with the ceramic coating. It is good enough to help you with minor dents and scratches. Plus there is also an option of you opting for ceramic coating + PPF on scratch prone areas like bumper, etc. Ideally you should get your car ceramic coated as soon as possible after delivery since it is an OEM paint and there won't be any scratches or chippings on it.

Maybe that's the reason Harrier and Safari still aren't sent for testing by Tata. Related discussion- Quote: 1. First let's talk about the elephant in the room I e. the safety rating of the Harrier. Did some additional digging with the help of my sources and found that the real culprit for the Harrier not meeting the front crash test norms lies just behind the ABC pedals in the engine compartment. Oil filter for the 2.0 Multijet engine is located in that place. Now according to my sources during frontal impact this oil filter and some other associated parts intrude through the firewall and push the ABC pedals inwards. This in turn results in leg injury to the driver and thus the Harrier loses some crucial points which ultimately results in it being unable to get a 5 star rating. Now this issue is exclusive to RHD SUVs because the Jeep Compass tested by Euro NCAP which got a 5 star result is an LHD model and according to my sources the Indian Compass which is RHD will also have the same above mentioned issue resulting in it also being a less than 5 star car. This is because in LHD configuration the location of the oil filter remains the same I.e. behind the firewall at the right portion where there are no pedals in LHD configuration to have any impact on the score. A sincere request to fellow bhpians who do not agree with what I have said above to not bash me or Tata Motors because I cannot prove what I have mentioned even though I have utter faith in my sources and neither can Tata prove otherwise unless they send the Harrier to GNCAP. So let's hope that Tata quickly sorts out this issue and comes out with a 5 star rated Harrier since it is the only product in its lineup which has not been tested.

508, Turbohead07 , 23:16 ,Newbie,"I have been scouting for a mid size SUV post selling my XUV700 AX7 D AT earlier this year. Luckily, got my XUV delivered within 3 months of launch at introductory price so took delivery. However, sold it after using for ~20k Kms since it was Diesel (I stay in NCR), was oversized for city usage, AT upshifts very late at high RPMs so NVH levels were perpetually high in the city and never ending rattles from my unit (may be initial batch issue). Though I must say that it was a superb machine but was just not fit for my liking/use case. I evaluated following options: 1) Hyryder (Strong Hybrid): Performance on highways was questionable and wifey did not approve interiors and overall feel. 2) Skoda Kushaq: Great to drive but reliability/ownership cost issues along with inferior interior quality for the price. 3) Venue N Line: Cramped and claustrophobic cabin. After considering above, I zeroed in on Elevate and New Seltos. Had booked one HTX+ 1.5 T DCT (prior to launch) and booked another (GTX+ DCT) via K-Code. But once pricing was announced, suddenly HTX+ DCT started looking expensive. But I just didn't like all black interiors of GT Line and hence, changed both the bookings to X-Line (though I was still in love with HTX+ interiors). A week into the booking, and post couple of visits to showroom, I was somehow convinced that may be I can miss some features but cannot live with Black Headliner (that's my personal disliking though I know it is in vogue and considered to be sporty) which makes cabin too claustrophobic. Hence, changed the booking to HTX+ again though will miss 360 camera and EPB (ADAS isn't of much use in Indian conditions as per my experience with XUV) but just can't compromise on interiors which will be user's primary touch/interaction point. Elevate was launched with only NA engine option and doesn't seem too exciting though it is a good overall package. Overall experience with Kia Dealership has been satisfactory and they haven't forced me for any insurance or accessories yet (though I will be taking Kia Convenience Plus package as it brings cost of ownership substantially down).", 3rd September 2023,kia-seltos,NOIDA,8,19,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Positive

510, bizi05 , 01:56 ,BHPian,"Hello everyone, I have been a silent observer in this forum for many years but never posted any message in this forum. In fact, I had not even enrolled in this forum. But now I got the chance to post my 1st message in this forum after signing up. This is because after 14 years now I am in the market to buy a Car or Pseudo SUV. At this moment I am still using my 2010 Santro XING, which never disappointed me. In fact, it has spoiled me with its Performance and fuel efficiency. I am getting 21 kmpl on the Highway(While driving with 100 KM/H +AC ON) and around 11-12 kmpl in Bangalore traffic. So far I have only driven this car about 70000 Kilometers. But with its age, it started giving minor issues like rattling noise, etc...Hence decided to upgrade to a Petrol CSUV, which can offer all advanced features as well as more cabin space. My hunt for a new car has been continuing since last year. Last Month I booked Kia Seltos 1.5T Petrol GTX +. But I am not 100% convinced with the Seltos 1.5T Petrol DCT due to below reasons: Cons: 1. Safety rating is still a question mark. 2. Initial pick-up is sluggish, despite the fact that it is one of the fastest CSUV. I tried to accelerate hard in Sports mode but the initial response was slow. But after certain delay it picks up the momentum. I found the 1.5 Naturally Aspirated MT(HTX variant) to be more responsive than DCT in lower gears. To confirm this I tried this exercise with multiple dealers in Bangalore. I am not sure if anyone else has noticed this. 3. Black interior in GTX+ variant. Due to the DCT lag issue during the initial gears, I was inclined towards the 1.5 NA Manual variant. But as the HTX+ misses out many features, I ended up with 1.5T DCT Variant. I feel Kia should have provided a 1.5T Manual variant or it should have provided all the GT line features like 360 camera, ventilated seats with 1.5 NA Petrol. I have also taken testdrive of Hyundai Creta, Grand Vitara, Tata Harrier, MG Hector, Skoda Kushaq, XUV700. And, here is my personal opinion on these cars. Creta: 1. Interior looks outdated and facelift creta may launch soon. 2. Similar Safety rating (3 Star) 3. Headlight throw is poor. Grand Vitara Strong Hybrid: Cons: 1. More body roll 2. AC is on weaker side. Checked in 2 different TD vehicle 3. Did not like the interior. 4. Doors felt very light weight. Similar to Baleno. Pros : 1. Very good pick-up. Harrier: Cons: 1. Comes only with Diesel engine, which made my Wife and Kid uncomfortable during 10 minutes of testdrive as they have diesel sickness. 2. Tata's after-sales service issues. 3. Stiff suspension and heavy steering made me little uncomfortable in city driving condition 4. Too big/bulky to manoeuvre in Bangalore city condition Pros: 1. Diesel manual is a beast. AC is super strong Hector: Cons: Last year I booked it but later cancelled it due to below reasons: 1. Poor Mileage 2. Road noise was more. May be due to Goodyear tyre. 3. No Physical buttons for AC. 4. Long waiting period and frequent price hike. Pros: 1. Spacious and class-leading features. I booked on 5-Feb-2022 and waited till Aug 2022 but didn't get the Car. During these 7 months, MG increased the price of Hector by 80K Kushaq 1.5T: Cons: 1. Felt like a hatchback. Space inside Kushaq is idle for 4 people. Space at the back seat is not idle for 2 adults + 5 year Kid 2. Less features. Pros: 1. Power and build quality XUV700 2.0T: Cons: 1. Long waiting period. 2. Missing features like ventilated seats. 3. Poor city mileage. 5-6 kmpl in Bangalore city traffic 4. Too big to manoeuvre in Bangalore city traffic 5. AX7L on-road price is around 30L, which is out of my budget Pros: 1. Good power. Better driving dynamics So now I am once again in confused state.

There is a slight Turbo lag agreed, but I don't think it is a deal breaker of any sort. Regarding your comparison with MT, MT will always be more sorted since it has the entire control in your hands. I would suggest you to go with the Seltos Facelift. If the Black interiors are not to your taste, go for the X-Line it has beautiful sage green interiors. HTX+ misses out on a lot of features and it is not a VFM product. If Diesel isn't your requirement then, Harrier isn't for you. Hector and XUV700 have fuel guzzler petrol engines, but if you have the budget you can go for the XUV700 AX7, AX5 is woefully under-equipped. I, personally don't like the Grand Vitara interiors since they don't even feel like they belong to a 20L car. So either go for the Seltos Facelift, or if you want you can even go with the Creta SX(O), agreed a facelift is around the corner but the car is still selling strong. An out of box choice could be the Alcazar. You will get all the features of the Seltos(360 cam, sunroof, etc.), plus an extra row at a similar price and it is not too big to maneuver as well and has a nice Turbo Petrol and Diesel engine.", 4th September 2023,kia-seltos,Mumbai,153,198,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Positive
513, jazzy , 08:53 ,BHPian,"My experiences have been similar: 1) Booked XUV 700 on the launch date and waited for months. - Great machine overall - Too big to maneuver in the city traffic, but not totally unmanageable - Too many initial niggles. I for one, believe that when a manufacturer sells something like a car, it's the manufacturer's reponsibility to test properly. ""Initial batch may have lots of minor issues"" is a very lame excuse. So I decided to wait for a couple of years before all ""niggles"" are sorted but by then, the goalpost had been moved. I cancelled my booking. 2) Checked out MG Astor, wife commented ""it doesn't feel like a big upgrade from i10, in terms of space"" and had to back out. 3) Test drove Hyryder. I really liked the looks of it and everything was great on paper. But: - very flimsy sunroof cover (I can live with it) - high noise level when it switches from EV mode to ICE mode (tough to ignore) - less-than-ideal headspace in the front row, even lower in the back row. Wife pointed out her 6 footer relatives will have their heads touching the roof and that would be super embarassing. Rejected. 4) I liked Kushaq too, with powerful engine, 5 star safety rating and nice ride quality. But feels like a hatchback, one of which I had been driving for over 10 years. Now that I bought GTX+ Turbo petrol, very satisfied with it, the only concern being safety rating. I'll wait for it to be crash tested, till then, will assume the rating to be somewhere between 3 and 4. The amusing thing is whenever I disclose to any of my friends or family that I bought this Kia, they remark we are thinking of buying X because of better safety rating. So I ask - does your kid wear seat belt when seated? and the answer is - no they like to roam around in the car OR they like to stand and poke their head out of the sunroof. And I ask - what car seat did you get for your infant? and the answer is - we thought the infant would be more comfortable in the mother's lap.

524, jazzy , 09:15 ,BHPian,"Experienced emergency braking for the first time yesterday. Despite some of my friends telling me to disable the feature when driving in the city as it can lead to someone rear-ending my vehicle, I have kept all ADAS features on, intentionally but also as I am still trying to understand all the features and possible scenarios when and how to use those. So, I had parked briefly on the side of a road, I started the car and tried to come out on the driving lane and in a flash, the car stopped and an alarm went off. It happened so fast that it took me a couple of seconds to realise what had happened. Just then a biker zoomed past me, on the driver side and I got the perspective. As is the general driving style in country, I was trying to take my car out ""slowly"", I had checked in my right side rear-view mirror and I thought the biker was too far behind and would have enough time to slow down. However, the ADAS system thought otherwise. If I remember correctly, I might have forgotten to put on my right indicator, a practice I, regrettably, sometimes forget since it's been years now driving in India. It was kind-of a force of habit when I had started driving here. In the end, I feel it's good to have this feature even within city limits.

What I read (and saw in youtube videos) is that, it used to be like that long time back. I used to drive that way about 15 years back, shifting to N always at traffic signal. Nowadays, it's no advantage in changing gear to N mode. Also, there is no practical use of changing to N, its only purpose is when your car is getting towed as the car won't budge if it's in any other gear. Similarly, P is only for parking, nothing else. The DCT is disengaged when auto-hold is on AFAIK but if you are pressing brakes and the car is still moving, the clutch may be strained (same as with manual). I am no expert either. In addition to this, if you put your car in N anytime, you must also use EPB or your brakes, to keep it from sliding.", 5th September 2023,kia-seltos,Bengaluru,68,143,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

Vehicle creeping using half-pressed brake without lifting your feet fully will create wear and tear to DCT. In the case of Idle-Start-Stop, as the engine comes to a complete halt, DCT is not under pressure of heating and hence, it will improve marginally on wear-tear of DCT in overall.

545, Chugh_H , 20:40 ,BHPian,"Since there are not too many delivery updates on the thread, let me share a pic of my GTX+ that I received on 1st of this month. I haven't driven much yet as I had an outstation trip planned but early impressions echo the views and sentiments that most people have talked about on the forum. In my view, the car looks great from the outside. I wish Kia would not have added the excessive chrome though, espc on the door handles and the window line. Once inside, it is true that the all black interiors might make a few folks feel claustrophobic but things do lighten up a little once you open the roof liner. Most of my first 100kms went in understanding all the warnings and chimes the car threw at me. By default, all the ADAS features were switched on, plus an audio warning to notify driver of children crossing on the road (switched it off via Navigation). I switched off all ADAS / assist features except auto parking sensor switch on, blind spot warning, and rear cross traffic emergency braking. I'll switch off the emergency braking too tomorrow as the braking action is too sudden. The other car in my garage is a 2018 Ecosport with 17"" wheels so I am not the best person to comment on ride quality, nothing can disappoint me in this regard. In comparison to Ecosport, the handling dynamics aren't bad, neither is the steering. That said, the ford is still more engaging to drive, more so because it's a manual. There is definitely a DCT lag at low speeds. Also, this isn't a smooth gearbox < 20kmph. Since I am moving from a manual, it's pronounced for me. But if you are in the mood to pick up some speed, it's effortless in this car. Things change significantly when you move the gearbox to S mode. With the whole dials changing color drama when you do so, and the gearbox keeping engine above 2k rpm, you ought to get a smile on your face if you are coming from a smaller car. The car is feature loaded to the T, but they somehow managed to skip a request sensor on the passenger side door. Also, the sensor is a button type rather than a capacitive one you get with Ford (or even Hondas). Makes me appreciate my Ford even more. If you are really lazy, the stop-and-go cruise control actually is useable on 2+ lane roads. There are options to dial how quickly and smooth the system will react. Also, at an instance it failed to recognise a bike which dived in between me and the leading car. The lane keep assist also worked fine when I tried, I don't trust the system yet so didn't try for a long time. I think I'd never get a chance to use it anyway. The blind spot warning is, well, a warning in your ORVM, until you actually turn on either indicator and then it beeps thrice or so if it senses an object, this is Ford / VW level smartness that I wasn't expecting in a KIA . I am not sure if this is how it is with all blind spot warning systems. The autohold is a godsend feature. If you tap the brake lightly and come to a stop, it wouldn't engage. Press the brake hard once and it will hold the car. Let me know if there are specific questions that I can help answer for those who are waiting for their deliveries / unsure of something.

I opted for bare minimum necessary accessories (no chrome obviously). Then I went to the Ceramic Pro studio just few metres from the showroom to meet and discuss my plan. They were very welcoming and are well prepared. I've been quoted 1.2 lacs for full Kavaca matte PPF with ceramic coating alloys, front grill etc. One more change I am gonna do is to replace the tyres with Conti UC6.

I'll start using the car 4 days a week for office starting this Monday so will understand the engine + gearbox behaviour better and share my thoughts. I had a short sprint today and would like to reiterate my earlier comment that picking up speed on this car is effortless. Right now, I am trying to understand the gearbox tuning plus how it behaves between D, manual and when I start flipping paddles. A quick comment to share is that although TBhp review mentions there is no ""S"" mode for the gearbox, my car does switch to Sx from Dx when I move the gearbox to manual (pull lever towards the right). This, plus the instrumentation changes to sport view (as it does when we change modes via drive / traction rotary dial). Post switching to manual, if I use paddle shifters or the lever to manually up / down a gear, instrumentation switches back to normal view but the gearbox stays in manual.

I have absolutely no problem in terms of performance and milage. It gives around 13 kmpl in city and the above trip returned a milage of 17.5 considering half of it was on unmetalled road and the car hasn't even gone through its first servicing I was fairly happy with it, although my father still compares it to the the 26 kmpl my cousin got in his strong hybrid grand vitara and still tells me we should have gotten that instead. There is no lack of power either. Press the pedal and it downshifts smoothly, if required, for overtakes. Also the cabin noise after driving a Honda city diesel for 7 years feels like I am driving an EV now It was breeze to drive on the highway. On un metalled road I was extra careful to slow the vehicle down even for the smallest of pot holes may be because it's a new car only 10 days old and I was trying to treat it with utmost care. But yeah didn't feel tiring at all and it's overall a comfortable car with very good seats and under-thigh support and legroom considering none of us in our family is over 5ft8"" tall. It could be different for people who are over 6ft tall. The dual zone ac is a blessing since I can't remember how many times I've had to argue with my wife over the temperature we want. I usually start to feel cold a lot sooner than her. We both were very happy with this feature. Only gripe is they should have given fan speed also to be controlled separately for the two zones, but it's ok since the air blowing on my face isn't from Antarctica anymore Ventilated seats work like a charm you start to feel the cold in your back within seconds. They interior quality is top notch for X-line variant. Very premium, it feels like your sitting in a car way over it's price point. The colour combination of black and sage green/grey along with the red stitching looks stunning. All the features of ADAS work flawlessly but can sometimes be very aggressive when it comes to breaking especially if there is a car in front of you that you might believe is still a fair distance away, the adas system feels otherwise. It's highly advisable to switch ADAS off when driving in the city traffic. Also the in-built map/navigation is decent enough. It covers most of the places and the best thing is that the HUD shows you directions during navigation and you don't need to take your eyes off the road when looking at direction. Overall I have no complaints and I'd put his car under the highly recommended category.", 9th September 2023,kia-seltos,Raipur,104,249,Drivetrain,Very Positive

You would just need to deal with wire that will be plugged into the USB port, with Wireless it's just little less cluttered (one less wire).

To use voice commands, you don't need AA/Apple carplay. I used voice commands yesterday without using Apple carplay. Connect via bluetooth and press the voice button once to start issuing commands. There is a list of sample commands mentioned in the manual. Apple carplay gives 3 functions, as I could understand. This is the first time I have used, so I am not certain about this but these 3 icons appeared on the screen once I connected: 1) Maps icon: Using google maps from phone, with bluetooth connectivity, I could get voice outputs to guide me to destination but google map couldn't be displayed on the instrument cluster. 2) Music icon: See your playlist on the phone and navigate (you can listen to songs from playlist using bluetooth too) 3) Phone icon: not sure of this function but using bluetooth too, I was able to make and receive calls, didn't try reading or writing messages or whatsapp or any other app as I would never do these things while driving.

It's a standard cruise control if there is no car in front of ours; if you set it at 80 kmph for example, it would be at 80 until it senses a vehicle in the front, it will auto-cancel if you press bake and it will also allow temporary acceleration like a normal cruise control. Bonus is that you can enable this from <30 kmph, unlike most other cars with standard cruise control. 2) Cluster will show directions, but not a map view. Attached a couple of pics for reference.

If there is, can you please try this, and then in one of your trips attempt to use the normal cruise control? Is it just the directions or a section of map that is visible? It's actually when I drive alone only then am I allowed to play the music of my choice. When I am with my wife, she gets to connect her phone. And when my daughter joins, she is the boss. So no use case for me here. And sadly no, you cannot switch adas off and cruise control on at the same time. The moment you do that adas will get switched on automatically and your cruise control will always be an adaptive one.

Also have fiddled through entire list of functions, settings, menu and found that i) Cruise control can't be set to normal cruise control, only Adaptive Cruise is all you get with choices to adjust the distances between the vehicle ahead. ii) No provision for maps display in cluster as nexon, only turns & indication if using inbuilt maps in cluster and HUD but no full maps. iii) There is a physical service manual and few other quick start guides provided by KIA, but the complete owners manual is not provided and also it could not be downloaded as pdf from KIA website. Only web manual for complete owners manual is present in KIA website which i recommend to read as explanation for all features related to cluster and features are explained there. The service manual provided with car has detailed ADAS information and other safety information but not detailed description of features provided in the Car. Also i found something interesting that our seltos has manual speed limiter function which might come in handy for some use cases. In this you can set any speed limit you want and the car will not go beyond that speed but if you want you can hard accelerate(pedaltometal) anytime to cancel this limiter. I find it very useful and avoid speeding tickets in the city for roads with speed limits of 50 or 60 kmph etc as my Xline 7DCT really zooms to high speeds in no time and you don't even realise the speeds until to see the speedo. https://www.carlinkit.com/2air Disclaimer: I'm just a satisfied customer & no way associated with Carlinkit or its subsidiaries and kindly carry out due diligence before any transaction.", 10th September 2023,kia-seltos,Kolkata,33,68,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

Once you set this Auto-Hold, it remains on till you set-it to off, even if you switch of the car and start, it will remember if you had pressed Auto-hold and persist. Auto-hold shows up on screen in Grey till its engaged near side of speedometer. Its a great help in traffic signal, after the car stops, Press the break for 1-2 seconds and it engages the Auto-Hold and it shows up in Green light. And when you need to move press the accelerator slightly and the car moves ahead, just note it required little bit more accelerator than you would normally would to disengage Auto-hold. One thing to be careful is, if you are in bumper to bumper traffic like in typical Bangalore traffic, if a vehicle is couple of inches away in front of side, you need to be careful applying the accelerator it can jump ahead a little while disengaging Auto-hold, in that case better to switch off auto-hold and move accelerator or wait till front vehicle moves ahead a little and then press the accelerator.

Do not race the engine. Whilst driving, keep your engine speed (rpm, or revolutions per minute) between 2,000 rpm and 4,000 rpm. Do not maintain a single speed for long periods of time, either fast or slow. Varying engine speed is needed to properly break-in the engine. Avoid hard stops, except in emergencies, to allow the brakes to seat properly. Don't tow a trailer during the first 2,000 km (1,200 miles) of operation. Fuel economy and engine performance may vary depending on vehicle break-in process and stabilize after 6,000 km (4,000 miles). New engines may consume more oil during the vehicle break-in period.

Yoko's are far better than the stock JK'S, i'm keeping around 33 psi which i found after various combinations and it's best for ride comfort as stock suspension is bit stiff. Regarding warranty have no idea because in abroad markets KIA are themselves providing bigger tyres in Seltos 235/50/18. So i believe this minor upsizing won't make that difference while claiming warranty though i believe i will lose on tyre protection cover which is included in Kia insurance as they cover stock tyres. Also since i own an X-line & somebody queried regarding maintenance for the color, i would like to state that initially i was apprehensive about matt black color and went for X-line only because of HUD & fast availability but now slowly the color is growing on me and i keep on feeling happier whenever i see the car everytime. Initially i was not ready for ppf & thought it's waste of money but after much discussion for protection i have got a matt ppf done from local detailer and it costed me around 1 lac with 7 years warranty.

I'm keeping the stock tyres for at least 20K kms since I don't really have any problems with the tyres so far. This is my first SUV, so I am already seeing a world of difference in the ride, handling and overall comfort, so not complaining about the tyres or ride quality. I've done ~300Kms so far and the engine and transmission have been *cheff-kiss* amazing. Haven't hit silly speeds yet (and probably won't) but the car just hits 80 in no time in sport mode. It's revv happy and aggressive and so good to drive. Eco is super conservative and hard to push and I seldom use Normal mode. I've so far gotten a city average of 8-9KMPL and highway average of 12KMPL. I tried lane assist on an open road and realized that it's dangerous to keep that ON in crowded regular commute/highway runs since it overrides driver inputs and aggressively maintains lanes. I've also switched off Forward collision avoidance system (not sure what it's called) since I found that also to be a bit to aggressive and not suited for Indian roads. I've kept all the other features ON and I'm trying them out regularly. The beeping sounds will eventually get annoying but I'm not complaining yet since I'm getting used to the size of the car and can use all the assist I can get. What I love so far: - The Turbo petrol engine and the DCT! - The absolutely gorgeous instrument cluster and entertainment system and how it's weaved into the dash - Auto Hold. Such a revelation. It works great for stop-go traffic and I don't have to worry about keeping my foot on the brakes - ventilated seats - Bose speakers - The all black interiors (YES, that). I was actually complaining about it on this forum before I got the car but it's grown on me and I really like it now. - All the driver assist tech. I find them super useful - Sunroof. Yes, I said that. I don't keep it open and I hate people putting their head out or standing while the vehicle is moving. But the sense of space in the car when you pull back the upholstery is such a new feeling for me. - Physical buttons for pretty much everything I need when I'm driving! (I'm not a big fan of the touch controls, especially for AC/entertainment systems) What I don't like so much: I'm nitpicking now, but here goes... - Wired carplay (I really wish I could use the wireless charging AND carplay at the same time) - The piano black around the cup holder/gear levers (i already see scratches and it's going to be hard to maintain them long term) - A slightly smallish dead pedal - Not so great fuel economy (but this is just me really looking for things to complain) Overall, loving the car and really looking forward to hitting the road every day.", 20th September 2023,kia-seltos,Chennai,41,234,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive
662, SPB_drives , 03:52 ,BHPian,"Panther Arrives: Kia Seltos 2023 Facelift 1.5 Turbo (Petrol) DCT If you appreciate quality and frugality with good looks, there is clearly only one car which offers it below the INR 50 Lakhs budget. To my mind this car is the Kia Seltos 2023 facelift. With my current daily drive being a Jeep Compass (manual, diesel, BS IV), christened Cheetah, I wanted to also have a fun turbo petrol in the garage before we strongly transition towards EVs. After experiencing literally all the notable cars within the INR 60 Lakhs budget, I have found solace in Panther, read on to find out why. Why Seltos? Maruti Grand Vitara / Toyota Hyryder Maruti’s Grand Vitara / Toyota Hyryder, come with a nice hybrid tech, and instantly likable when I drove them in the city, but their overall lack of quality really shocked me. The automatic gear lever doesn’t move with sophistication, the plastics remind me of my first gen year 2005 Swift (the power window switches are the same!!!) and the boot space is just impractical. Also, the noise from the Atkinson cycle petrol engine was crass and was very much audible in the cabin. This car made perfect sense as a city car, but we like our cars to be multi-purpose, so this one was overruled. Skoda Kushaq / VW Taigun These both look gorgeous, especially the Taigun in red. Come with potent engines. But inferior air-conditioning and glaring steps taken towards cost-cutting make their presence felt quite alarmingly. From the noisy seat ventilation motor to the poor plastics, small boot and doubtful after-sales stories, I decided to not say hi to the German engineering which has been diluted for Indian (Bhartiya, being politically correct?!) audiences. MG Astor Except for the beautifully red stitched dashboard, I found the car to be overall a “jack of all trades, master of none”. While I do know that the complete adage is “…but still better than master of one”, but I found the small boot, unimpressive 1.3 litre turbo mill with TC gear box, plus the useless (and might I add, distracting) robotic eyes on the dashboard to not appeal to my senses. Hyundai Creta I don’t like the design language Hyundai has adopted. I liked the new boxy design language Hyundai premiered on the Santa Fe and I hope they adopt it for the incoming new vehicles. But with a facelift around the corner, and with the same platform and engines as that of Seltos, ignoring the segment leader was an easy choice. MG Hector I already have a black Hector at my disposal, christened Kaala Haathi. It is a fabulous vehicle to be driven around in, and for the highways, but it is clearly not a city car as it is too big. With the budget being flexible and aspirations running high, I did check out the BMW X1 (2023 facelift), Mercedes GLA and the Audi Q3. You can read my thoughts on these here. To sum it up, I found myself paying exorbitant money for the badge with very little change in the driving characteristics or dynamics. The big-league car brands need to level up their game to provide an experience and technology to its prospective customers which helps them justify the price they pay for their cars and not just on the basis of the brand name. Honda Elevate I did check out the Elevate in a showroom, did not get a chance to test drive it. To me it looked like a fat Maruti Ignis from some angles. Honda has not put any one stand-out feature/characteristic in this car; I was honestly waiting for the strong hybrid Elevate but that is not happening as Honda has decided to jump onto the EV bandwagon. Also, the Honda showroom people looked quite overwhelmed with the attention they were getting. I feel Honda is playing a catch-up and still did not bring in it’s a game to the fight. Seltos Materialises With the facelift being launched, I knew in my head that I was sold on this. I had already driven the previous 1.4 turbo DCT transmission and was mighty impressed. With the new raving reviews of the 1.5 turbo DCT, I knew I would like it in a heart-beat. The DCT failure tales did strike me and to be honest, this was the only chink in this otherwise gorgeous package apart from safety; I noticed that Hyundai/Kia group with time have implemented their learnings, and among other things have dulled the initial pickup of the car in order to protect the DCT unit. Also, have taken the extended warranty for the peace of mind, so que sera sera on this much debated topic. The good bits: - Suspension feels mature and minor road undulations are ironed out quite well. This experience is probably due to the new tyres, but I must mention again that the JK tyres for someone who will be confined to the city is not bad. - Road noise is well contained and this car is silent till 100 km/hr, it gradually starts creeping in from then on. This is unlike Compass where you literally feel cocooned and oblivious of the speeds you are doing. - The dual screen set-up is very well executed. The driver’s screen has got trippy backgrounds which add zing and intuitiveness. - The buttons and switches have a very nice tactile feel and feedback and operate well. - When driven in the Eco mode, the car more often stays in the 7th gear while cruising and this aids mileage a bit. That said, the normal driving mode is very acceptable for city as well as the highway. The bad: - The car wants me to take a coffee break ever so often. I think this is a software issue which should get ironed out soon. The media drive cars had this feature, but this is missing from my car, I’m sure this is an inadvertent miss. - The boot door takes a good push to shut properly. - The roof headlining is not a well woven cloth, it is some other material found in cheaper cars. - The in-car-entertainment unit notifies that there is a software update required, but it throws up an error of “insufficient space”. I wonder how much space is required when the used-up space is literally zero MBs as this is a new car. The service personnel informed me that they will install this software update during the first service (what happened to OTA updates?) - While the ADAS features stay switched off once they are switched off, the rear cross traffic alert warning and braking switches on every time the car is switched on. I don’t think this is too problematic as the speed while reversing is anyway too slow. - Safety is a big question mark and I honestly don’t see it taking any major leaps in this facelift update. This is a feature rich car meant to pander to the gizmo loving audience. - The automatic headlamp full beam and dipper function is very sensitive and keeps the headlamps in dipper mode more often than required. Had to switch it off. Driving the Panther The car handles well and the steering has considerable weight making you feel confident when you take that quick corner. I feel the body roll is very well contained, the car does not feel all over the place. This car is quick to drive and over-taking either in the city or on the highway is a breeze – this is very important as the highways are increasingly getting more crowded. Did I try the ADAS you ask – no, not at all. I think except for the very new expressways such as the Samruddhi Mahamarg (between Mumbai and Nagpur) which are straight as an arrow and are sparse, using ADAS on any Indian highway/expressway is still a pipe dream for using these technologies which can control the vehicle. Our highways are full with cars overtaking from the wrong side, stray dogs and cattles, people jumping in from nowhere and speed breakers/pot holes. Then why did I buy the GTX+ variant, well, it was only for the electronic parking brake. Should you change the tyres? Just post the delivery I swapped the JK Royale UX with the Continental UC6 in the same size. Now to be honest, my vehicle was having a psi of 46 in all the four tyres, and I drove in them for some 30 kms before getting them swapped. I actually found the suspension to be softer than the 2019 model which I had driven, very much Creta like. And mind you, this is with 46 psi, the recommended tyre pressure is 35psi. With the UC6 tyres, the car did get a bit more stable and no more did it feel jittery like it did with the JK tyre – but this is not an apple to apple comparison as the tyre pressure on the JK tyre was too high during the delivery. So you might ask why did I still change the tyres, well simple, I wanted to leave no stone unturned for having a superlative experience with my new machine. I can tell you that the car performs well with the UC6, no tyre noise, no squealing, no traction loss, no skidding on the corners. I drove it extensively in the rains while going to Amritsar from Gurgaon and found them lending a positive impact on the car. Frontier Kia (Gurgaon) experience - Overall a nice experience. My request for PDI was well received. Insurance and accessories were not forced on me. I eventually took the insurance from outside as it was much cheaper. - The salesperson refused to take cheque for the full payment of the car price and I was compelled to do multiple RTGS transfers to make the full payment. Infact, while asking for taking the payment by cheque, I was asked to deposit the cheque myself in the bank! What happened to the customer experience? - The car delivery experience could have been better, they have a very small delivery area and allow only their personnel to drive the car out. Unlike your expectation to drive your own car on your own from the showroom. - No discounts were offered, and I was prepared for this as this is a new hot car in the market. Please do let me know what all of you think on my thoughts above, Cheers!

The suspension performed really well on the slightly winding Kerala state highway, the engine was also very tractable and refined, not able to comment much on the performance as I was keeping the engine speed below 2k for most of the time. Came back home extremely happy with how the car performed. And to add to that happiness, on searching online about the sunroof problem, I saw many posts about the same and how to solve this by recalibrating the sunroof mechanism.

744, red.devil_19 , 10:12 ,BHPian,"Hi all, a friend of mine has booked a Seltos in Bangalore. The car was already available in stock & the dealer says it has been allocated to him, but they are refusing to share the VIN with him unless he pays the entire down payment amount. They're ok to do registration after PDI but I find it absurd that they are refusing to share the VIN with him. In between he also received a random SMS stating ""car has been de-allocated & he has been put back into waiting list"". When he called the sales guy, he said the SMS is a mistake. My friend then checked with another dealer & they said there is just one piece of the particular variant/colour in question available in stock. To me it looks like these 2 dealers are trying to sell the same car to different customers. My understanding is that a customer pays the booking amount, a car is allotted to the customer, which means there should be a VIN officially assigned to the corresponding booking which is supposed to be shared to customer. Then customer can make payment, perform PDI & register the vehicle if it passes PDI. This is the process I have come across buying all our cars in the past. My friend also called up Kia Customer Care who initially said its upto the dealer when to share VIN but after some pressing they reluctantly agreed to escalate the matter.", 26th September 2023,kia-seltos,Bangalore,129,181,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

760, nkvyas , 00:28 ,Newbie,Finally the day has arrived. Took the delivery of my Xline Petrol today from SNR Kia Bhopal. Here are my initial impressions: It took around month and a half of waiting for the car to be allotted which is impressive given the official waiting told to me was 14-15 weeks. PDI on last Monday was smooth no niggles and SA was kind enough to move the car around for me to get a better light and view. The final on road price came out to be 21.7L with BH series registration. The insurance was initially quoted as 76k but they were kind enough to match with what I was getting online via Acko. Finally it was 52k. Was given a gift hamper which had chocolate box and two coffee mugs. Odo reading was just 3km on delivery and they gave 5 litres of fuel. Switched off some of the ADAS features like emergency braking etc for now as I am still getting used to them. TPMS read around 50 psi which I have adjusted to 35 once I exchanged the stock JK tyres with Continental UC6. Got em @ 8500 per tyre after exchange of 4500 for JK. Max mileage for initial 90km drive turned out to be 16 with mix of eco and sport modes. It's too early to judge this I believe. PPF is due in few days with Ceramic Pro @ 1.3L The car is just too good in all aspects so far and didn't disappoint me anywhere. The ride became much smoother and silent with new tyres. Too many beeps and warning sounds which will take it's own sweet time to get used to and enable/disable as per the necessity. The only thing I hate about Kia & Hyundai are their trumpet horns. It's way too irritating and can easily become the reason for road rage. It's a personal opinion though and I try to not use the horns unless absolutely necessary but I have to be careful with this. Long drive is upcoming post diwali when I take it to Hyd. Will post an update later for that.

768, wadewilson , 16:27 ,BHPian,"Dear BHPians, wanted some advice regarding delivery of the car. We had booked the GTX+ in August. The car is in transit and is currently in Bihar - as per SA, the car might reach on 1st October. However, with the price rise set to come into effect from 1st October, I was wondering whether it would be advisable to pay the full amount now and have them bill us for the old ex-showroom price? I understand that once we pay the full amount, the dealership would have the upper hand and if anything goes awry, we'd have to face some issues. However, I wanted to ask, whether it is worth it?

My dealer had done the same thing, in fact, he called on the 30th of the month and tried to convince me to get the loan disbursed immediately. I was also told that road taxes are going to increase very soon and they have this inside info from state govt. and also Kia will soon increase prices etc. none of which really happened till now. I figured this was just a ploy to get their monthly targets met. Are you sure about the source of the price rise information? I was in the same dilemma, should I pay upfront and risk being at dealer's mercy thereafter or should I (possibly) damage my relationship with the dealer and be ready for any possible side affects. I would suggest, politely turn down dealer's request or put your own conditions like you would like to see the car first or you are not able to do it right away for some reason.

In one of the vehicle they found the battery/some electrical component was replaced. Hence advised us not to take that car. 2. They found one of the tyre manufacturing date was little older compared to other tyres 3. Regarding the Paint, they used a device to check the paint density of each and every panel to figure out the uniformity and also to make sure no panel is repainted. If a person has the device then he/she can do it by yourself. 4. At the side corner of the bonnet (bonnet edge facing downside) they noticed and reported a small chip off (size will be equal to the size of sugar particle). Which I could have missed.

The good part was that they never forced me to buy any insurance, extended warranty or accessories. I willingly bought extended warranty and some accessories (floor/boot mat, door visors, screen protector etc). Looking forward to taking delivery next week due to some pending formalities. So finally got my HTX+ Turbo DCT delivered last week which I have driven ~350 Kms. While I agree with the popular opinion that it is not as VFM as GTX+, but it meets most of my requirements (except for 360° camera) and those plush brown interiors (for which I consider having paid a premium by not opting for more VFM higher variants) bring smile everytime I drive the car. Having driven ADAS enabled car for more than a year, I find it to be less suited for Indian driving conditions and quite intrusive for a person like me who loves driving. Here are some of the initial observations: Likes: 1) Refinement: Having driven Diesel for ~last 7 years, shift to Petrol is indeed a welcome change. Engine is supremely refined and NVH levels are well contained. 2) Gearbox: Shifts are appropriate and most upshifts are between 1500-1800 RPMs (unlike my previous XUV 700 where you want the gearbox to upshift but it holds onto a gear till RPM> 2000 RPM). I have been driving light footed till Vehicle break-in period but tried paddle shifters and they can spice up your driving experience considerably. 3) Interiors: are undoubtedly best in the segment in terms of fit and finish and quality of materials used. IMHO, it feels better than XUV700 also which is a segment above. The LCD instrument cluster especially dynamic theme looks quite awesome. 4) Kia Service: The delivery experience was seamless despite me buying insurance from outside (for which the dealership never forced). They were prompt in connecting with service team who are also very forthcoming. Dislikes: 1) Headliner: In contrast to a rich looking cabin, headliner seems to be of average build quality. 2) Acceleration: While I have been driving light footed, initial acceleration doesn't make you feel that you are driving most powerful car in the segment (on papers). Overtaking on open roads is a breeze though I am yet to test on sudden acceleration requirements in City and will update on this later. Jerkiness of gearbox at lower speeds (as reported by some users) may settle down post 1500 Kms on ODO (as per manual). 3) Safety: a lot has already been discussed on this. But with it's distant cousin i.e. facelift Verna receiving coveted GNCAP 5 stars, expecting some improvement in this area. 4) Fuel Economy: I have driving in normal mode and the average is ~10-11/KMPL (MID) in city driving (although with lighter traffic). I will be ok if the long term fuel economy settles at ~12-13 in city and 15-16 on highways.

Braking distance i had kept it as 2 cars as i was driving below 100 kmph, 2 cars is comfortable braking distance for India i guess, if you keep 4 cars, it brakes too early and possibility of someone rear-ending can happen. Have disabled forward collusion and side take-off feature of ADAS, as we in India drive so closely it will press emergency brake and could result in undesired consequences. Reverse collusion assist i have enabled, which is very useful, especially which taking reverse in blind spots. Have helped me once when a silent fast moving EV scooter passed and emergency braking kicked in, though was not visible in 360 deg camera, i guess radar picked it up. Overall very satisfied with the ADAS in Seltos, i can confidently start using in highways and expressways.

The SA assured me that it was linked to the blower speed and turned it up to the maximum, but even then, I couldn't feel any difference. Interestingly, a few days ago, I had seen the same test drive car at the dealership and experienced the same issue. My friend, who was with me during that visit, didn't even realize that the seat ventilation was running, despite it being set to its highest level. At that time, I had assumed that was due to the car being in idle mode. In contrast, my parents own a 2019 edition Seltos, and having driven it a few times in the Goa summer heat, I can attest to how effective the seat ventilation is in the Seltos. I want to believe that this issue is specific to the heavily used and possibly abused test drive car.

For me, not at all. I personally never liked the looks of Harrier/Safari, they look like a cross between Land Rover and XUV 500. There are some butch-looking muscular projections all around but unlike XUV 500, they look dispropotionate. Keeping looks aside, I believe Harrier/Safari is for a different set of customers. Seltos is the ultimate car in terms of refinement at this price point, unless you are willing to spend at least 12-15 big ones more and move to 1-2 segments above, you won't get the same in any other car. I am going to write a much longer post on the overall ease of driving a seltos, with it's auto-headlamps, auto-hold, smooth DSG, auto-dimming IRVM and much more. All I have to do it hop on to my car, click the push button and drive. I find it wierd that some proponents of Elevate are complaining about too many ""confusing"" features in Seltos. On the contrary, I just have to set those features to my liking and never bother about those. Another important reason for not leaning towards Harrier/Safari is all the reports of niggles/issues by early customers and of course, the notorious service centers of Tata. I simply hate running around people to get things done for something that I have already paid over 20 lakhs. And of course, there is issue of petrol vs diesel. Yes diesel-powered vehicles are more torquey, especially at lower speeds but the world is moving towards petrol (and electric/hybrid) faster than many of us realise. Chinese customers have been leapfrogging to EVs directly. In a few years, with a diesel car, you may be left holding a tin can. In the strange times that we live in, even EV technology is changing so fast that current tech could be obsolete very quickly and some new EV tech could take over. May be we need to keep changing cars every 3-5 years but that's another discussion.", 7th October 2023,kia-seltos,Bengaluru,68,143,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

They didn't insist on anything more. Bought zero dep insurance from them at 35K. The initial ODO was 33km (Gurgaon stockyard to Delhi showroom). 2. Reduced tyre pressure at delivery from 42 to 35 psi and thereafter the drive is smooth. My 95% drive will be in Delhi and NCR or expressways, so I will continue with JK stock tyres. 3. At city speeds the car is really quiet, other than little tyre noise. 4. Drive in Eco mode is absolutely dull, the engine strains to pick up speed from standstill. Drive in Normal mode is what I would be driving all through now. Will test Eco mode again in some other situations, possibly in stop and go traffic, to see if it is suitable there. 5. Autohold is a boon. Reduces the driving strain of an automatic in stop and go traffic to minimum. It is a real pleasure. 6. The inbuilt map is a disaster. It doesn't recognise even well known places in Delhi. Kia India, if you are reading this, please ask the service provider to massively update this feature. Used Google maps through Android Auto and it worked as it should. 7. The Bose music system is excellent for me as I never expect to listen to theatre like sound in any car. And I am no audiophile either. 8. Headlights are great for city drives. Nothing to complain. Have to figure out auto headlight feature as it turns on the lights even in daytime shadows of a flyover or a tree. 9. Already getting an overall fuel efficiency of about 10kmpl. I anyway drive with lightfoot and within city speed limits. 10. The dark interiors are a non issue now, although I used to dread them prior to the purchase.

849, Chugh_H , 17:58 ,BHPian," Quote: Originally Posted by Flasshhhh Congratulations! I am also looking to final Kia Seltos in near future. But, confused between HTX Plus and GT edition. I totally loved the interiors of HTX Plus and equally disliked the same in GTX. GT Edition has ADAS, Auto Hold, Electronic Parking Brake, 360 degree camera. Will I miss them, if I opt for HTX Plus? I had initially booked the HTX+, but then moved my booking to GTX+ after price announcement. Our case could not be any different; I love the black interiors of the GTX+ and my wife too appreciates the color scheme, although she never had a chance to experience other variants. Note that we were using a 2018 Ecosport until a few months ago and had absolutely no issues with it's black interiors too which many people do not like. I'll share my views about ADAS below but I believe that it would suit to only three kinds; 1. Drivers who are the top 5% disciplined ones in India; who maintain ~7-10 second distance at all times. Or use their car primarily for calm expressway drives. 2. People who are early tech adopters; those who are keen to experience it and don't mind paying extra. 3. People who are likely to assume that they could've used ADAS in a situation; I am sure this thought would flip once they actually have access to ADAS in India (at least in the format KIA / Hyundai is offering it). If you think you'd always be regretting a car without ADAS because 'today was the right time', spend the extra bucks. On auto-hold and EPB, I'd say that I never had an issue holding brakes or pulling the handbrake lever until now. But I'd like to not go back. 360 camera is a genuinely good feature in my books, and I really appreciate how you get the camera feed on cluster when you switch on either indicator. The cameras have a larger coverage area than ORVMs. I have now completed close to 1K kms on my car and have been wanting to share my experience so far. I'll draw comparisons to Ecosport. Exteriors;Subjective topic, but I think most of the people will not dislike the way this car looks. To me, especially in black, it is one of the best styled cars in this price range. A close second to me would be a lowered & blacked-out Virtus. I always appreciate the way Kia has designed the headlights. They look absolutely crazy to me, in all states - be it DRL on or headlights on. The indicators are sweeping types, the sweep is clean and not like how you'd see in some aftermarket blinkers. While the headlights look great, they are average at best. When it rains, some may take a moment to realise if they are switched on or not (more so when fogs are off). Even the GT line gets chrome grill. I do not like it at all. When I consulted Anish from 5c car care in Gurgaon (also a team-bhpian), he suggested I'd rather get a new part which comes in black from factory than getting this wrapped if I do not want any maintenance trips. I do not want maintenance trips, so I checked the prices to consider if I'd like to get the grill replaced from an X-line. While the grill part is easy, the parts store at Allied Kia could not figure out if the chrome above headlight is a child part or not. If it's not a child part, it's too expensive to get this done for me. So I left it at that. I'll followup on this again when time permits. The front also houses the camera and the radar. The differently styled bumpers are not loud in black color. In lighter colors, the painted bumper inserts stand out. Inner rim of every wheel is also painted black as far as you can see. And then maybe even more. There's twin exhaust on the 1.5T GTX+. I don't know if they sound different from HTX+, but any music they probably make is overshadowed by the engine noise at higher RPMs. Connected tail lights look classy IMO. I had a chance to follow my own car for a few KMs and liked how the car looks overall. With help from Anish from 5C car care, the car is ceramic coated almost everywhere that's painted. All windows, front and rear windshields, sunroof and even ORVMs are also coated. Good luck disturbing my mental balance now, you pigeons! Front view. The painted inserts on the bumper do not stand out in this color as much as they do in White or Silver. Sweet headlights. Kia did pay attention to styling. While they look great, they aren't great on performance. A good part of my experience with the car has been in rainy season, so this could very well be an impression you'd not agree with when you use them. Sweet alloys too, but unlikely to be recalled by anyone when discussing their favorite ones. Twin exhaust pipes, real ones. Tail-lights looks good to me, espc when it's dark. A picture post SystemX Ceramic coating. Credit goes to Anish from 5C car care. It took me 30 mins to realise how devoted he is to his work. I initially thought the reviews were all paid when he was talking to me face to face and then suddenly noticed a paint defect on my dirty car. 'Fraud', I said. But then I spent the next 9 mins looking at the spot from 9 different angles and finally could figure out a small shift in paint quality. It's on both rear doors, at the same spot so must be a thing from the factory. I'd appreciate if nobody asks me where is this until I go back to him for my first car wash post ceramic. Anish's work is 5/5 - it's one of those places where I'd go anytime without asking prices. Another picture from Anish's workshop. Interiors;Let me start with the obvious first; Yes, I do like the black interior theme. I've never had a problem with my Ecosport (also black interiors except the roofliner). I've always desired black interior dashboard since I first had an opportunity to experience the facelift Compass. The roofliner is also black. I, again, like it. That said, can completely understand that it could make some people feel claustrophobic. The headroom is limited. My height is average at best and even I can sense it. Anyone who wears a turban and / or is 5.9+, please do take a test drive before you book one. Easy to find a comfortable driving position. If there are people on this forum who appreciate electric seats without a memory function, please share your views and explain why. I cannot find a reason. Skoda is following this trend too, so there must be something coming up in the research reports. Screens are sharp, and the brightness auto-adjustment works as good as it does on any flagship smartphone! Most of the interaction points are backlit. Except the ORVM adjustment buttons, and the sunroof controls. If Seltos has auto-dimming IRVM with buttons that are backlit, Seltos also deserves backlit roof control buttons. There is no way to adjust the backlight for the buttons separately though. If you are like me and like to keep the buttons backlit to the max, you'd not be able to do it without the screens blinding you. I wish Kia had this adjustment separated. On the steering controls, move knob up for volume up, and move it down for volume down. I'd expect the track change knob also to follow same direction but for some weird reason it doesn't. Direction up = volume up = previous track. Direction down = Volume down = Next track. I like ventilated seats. If you stay in a hot / humid location, you may like them too. Driver's view. I increased screen brightness for this shot from my phone. When you adjust screen brightness is only when you can adjust backlight for all the buttons. No separate dimmer adjustment. Front cam shows my Ather in this view. Quality is good, and parking sensors are calibrated well too. Sunroof controls are not backlit. Or so dim, I cannot notice it. Sharp instrumentation! Initially I was overwhelmed with so much info, but now used to it. No way to turn off idle engine stop permanently. Notice I've switched off front collision system, and lane keep assist. Yes, you can notice the mileage too, I never drive to chase this number. Auto-headlights are on in this shot. So is auto-hold, which can not be engaged in R (rightly so) and is not required in P. The screen is brighter and sharper than one would expect. But the frame rate / animation could be more fluid when you switch between driving modes. Engine & Gearbox;Short version is that the engine + gearbox combination is quick! It's easily one of the fastest cars on the road. I have mentioned in one of my earlier posts that the gearbox is jerky at low speeds. Allow me to take this back. As I now step into the 1K+ kms mark, I do not notice shifts 90% of the time (when accelerating linearly). You'd sometimes notice a shift from 2nd to 3rd gear, and expectedly when you kick down the pedal for overtakes. That said, the gearbox has no telepathy powers in any mode. I find the Eco mode useless for me, I first need to adjust to a turbo lag before I can afford to shift early to save fuel. This is easily one of the fastest cars on the road. The car crawls at ~6 kmph as you slot into D. People like me who are new to EPB and autohold may jerk the passengers a few times initially. Note I say initially. Once you get the hang of it, it's as smooth as if you are controlling a clutch yourself. Initial acceleration is okayish, not slow. Once you move into 3rd, the car responds fairly quickly to your acceleration input. Engine is as silent as my Ecosport's Dragon at lower RPMs, and beats it on all aspects of NVH at idle and at higher engine speeds. On open roads, I find it best to move the gearbox to S. There is no lack of power in D, I do this only because I like to keep the engine above 1800 RPM. Once in S, you'd be smiling. In fact, coming from an NA engine the power / torque curve kind of overwhelmed me when I first experienced the acceleration. Compared to Ecosport, the torque is sudden and there's a decent acceleration even post 110 km/h. Again, the Ecosport is no slouch but the experience is day and night for me. From slotting my Ford into 3rd at 30 and then taking it to 130 in the same gear, to now a turbo engine that has a step change in acceleration post ~1600 rpm, I love them both. Paddle shifters are quick. Use it in D mode and the gearbox would revert back to auto if it senses linear acceleration for ~6 seconds. If you use paddles in S, you'd be in manual mode until RPM drops too low. At any point, long hold the right paddle to move back to auto mode. Paddles are immensely helpful for overtakes. NVH levels are great. Tyre noise is higher than you'd expect in a car of this price. I felt even the Ecopias on my Ford are slighly better in this regard (and only in this regard I hope). Suspension and Brakes; Suspension is overall better than my Ecosport. No surprises here. But I'd like to mention that the ride quality on the Ford gets exponentially better when you pick up speed. The difference between 15 and 70 km/h on the Ford is huge. But on the Kia, not so much. If I'm driving at 70 km/h on a road that has rumble strips every now and then, I'd actually prefer my Ecosport. I understand the car has disc brakes on all four wheels, but I still find the braking feel, feedback and performance to be as good or as bad as a car with only two at the front. More on this as I continue to drive. ADAS;A good 80% of people may not use 80% of ADAS features in 80% of their time driving. IMO, the front and rear collision avoidance systems are better turned off unless you are in the top 5% of the most disciplined drivers in India. If you come too close to another vehicle thinking you'd be able to squeeze in, the ADAS may surprise you. For the latter, you'd find it too sensitive for Indian conditions. The only real use of ADAS for me is blind spot warning system, works flawlessly and will not intervene with braking unless you are taking your car out from a parking lane (and then it will, which I didn't know). The rear cross traffic warning and auto-braking would get auto enabled when I restart my car. Can someone confirm if it's specific to my car? Car likes a break more than my colleagues on notice period. I have this warning popped up everyday without fail, sometimes 2-3 times in a 14 kms drive. And no, there is no way to turn it off, at least in my car. The only option under DAW is to turn on / off an alert when lead car departures. As part of ADAS features, you also get High beam assist, which is sensitive to street lights too. So in city conditions or well-lit highways, it wouldn't engage high beams. Camera feed on instrument cluster is a good feature. I like it. All of us should be aware that a fully attentive driver is required at all times even when using ADAS. In this car, I have experienced the system could at anytime fail to read the lane lines even when they are clearly marked. If I can see them without my glasses, the camera should too. So if you intend to use lane follow, do take note. I have only used these features to test them, very cautiously. Now that I've seen how they can work and how they fail, I suspect the use case for me might reduce. Summary of what I like;Looks good. Inside out. Good quality interiors. Loaded with features. Good engine + gearbox combination. Summary of what I do not like;Light build quality feel when opening / closing doors, espc with outer door handles. Safety aspect. Small things Kia could have done better like adding backlights for ORVM adjustment buttons, ORVMs could have been extra convex at the outer end, backlit sunroof controls, request sensor at both front doors, memory seat profiles (if not buttons) that could have synced with infotainment profile. I also believe this car has all the hardware that would be required to add auto-parking features too, Kia must be saving it for their ADAS 3.0. I'll try and update this thread again with more observations. Meanwhile, happy to answer specific questions.", 7th October 2023,kia-seltos,Delhi,41,222,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

In my test drive I really liked how whenever I stopped at a traffic light the front camera activates automatically and I get full view of surroundings. I would have been more than happy paying a premium of Rs.60K for both 360 and Bose speakers together. Bose speakers, btw, are just okay. If you are an audiophile you'd not be able to appreciate them. On my Ecosport, I have a very modest setup with Infinity components at the front, a subwoofer in the boot, a 4 ch amplifier and a DSP; coming from that setup to the Seltos was a letdown. The sound is balanced in the Seltos, okayish, but the real problem is the soundstage experience. Ecosport's soundstage is excellent, you feel like the music is around you. With an additional speaker up front, Kia still isn't able to match it. Overall, good when you tune it, but not good enough if you have an ear for quality. Also, I prefer not to use bluetooth music only because it makes the already average speakers sound bad. I prefer to plugin my phone and then use Spotify at highest music quality. What I have understood from this purchase is the underlying difference in principles at Ford vs Kia. Ford does everything as if they really want it to work. Kia mostly does things so they can sell more. I'm saying this because IIRC the stock speakers from Ford were equivalent to the speakers in this car. Headlights, Bose speakers, ADAS, e-seats in the KIA are all testament to this theory of mine that KIA's following 'Jo-dikhta-hai-wo-bikta-hai'. Why I'd still pay a premium for the speakers is because I'm afraid to think how the unbranded speakers would sound. I should also mention to you that I too appreciated this auto turn-on of parking sensors with camera view at low speeds at first. After a couple of 100 KMs, I turned off camera view. After another couple of 100 KMs, I turned off auto-activation of parking sensors as well. Almost 50% of my daily 30km drive is in either bumper-to-bumper or slow moving traffic, so this was too much of an annoyance as I got used to the dimensions of the car. Please do consider in what conditions you drive and how much you'd be able to use this feature.

I'd definitely pay the premium for 360 camera. This is the first time I've ever driven a car with a 360 camera, and within a month I have become so used to it that I might not be able to drive a car that doesn't have it now. My house is in a very narrow lane with houses on each side and a lot of cars parked on the road outside their respective houses, (including my Honda city parked outside my house), and when I take the car out from my main gate or put it in, 360 camera combined with the rear view camera helps me a lot every time when there is someone else's car parked outside near the entrance of my house. I'd definitely say pay the premium and get the 360 camera, the speakers not so much.

854, jazzy , 04:07 ,BHPian,"Petrolheads, what is the optimum fuel to be used with the our turbocharged engines? I normally use regular Shell unleaded petrol. Last week I got filled up with V-power unleaded petrol, on a relative's suggestion that it would help keep the engine cleaner in the long run.

I know if you look at something day-in & day-out you kinda get used to it. But is it really a dealer breaker? Does it make the cabin look smaller than it actually is. The Seltos cabin (headroom especially) is already lesser than that of the Creta; and this all-black interiors makes it even worse. So I would like to understand from the existing owners, how has it been actually? P.S.: Please share your thoughts of the sunroof & it's cover closed. Opening the huge sunroof surely makes the cabin a lot airy. I also had the same fear as people were saying it's too claustrophobic and too dark. I loved the tan interior of HTX+ and I love all GT line features. I booked GT line because of the features. After seeing all the comments I was worried but I decided to go with features. I took delivery of my car last Wednesday and to be honest I was pleasantly surprised by the all black interiors. It looked really nice to me. I removed all the plastics the day I received it, and I like it. None of my fears turned true. It's premium and I didn't find it claustrophobic at all even with the sunroof closed. Now I like it more that it won't get dirty easily like other colours. Opening sunroof will make it even better(though front row passengesr won't feel much when the sunroof is open).

875, wadewilson , 14:06 ,BHPian,"Took delivery of our Kia Seltos (GTX+ Diesel in White) on Friday, 6th October 2023. Have driven it for close to 350kms now and thought of penning my observations of the same in a brief format. Do note that I would be comparing it against my current ride, the XUV700 (AX7L AWD) which cost 1.5L more (introductory prices) than the current Seltos (Introductory Price) in my home state - I understand that they are from different segments but this is the car I have in my garage and so I will inevitably be comparing the two. Also, please note that these are my opinions and observations, your experience and opinion of the car might be different: LikesNo sound from front suspension unlike XUV700 - the suspension on the Seltos is a bit firm compared to the XUV700 but in my opinion, it handles potholes with aplomb and also feels more planted than my Creta. No issue with either of the two displays - No lag, no blank displays, no issues whatsoever. Really appreciate the fact that things work the way they're supposed to whereas in my XUV700, there are some times when I've had to navigate in reverse with no camera feed due to blank display issue which affects us to this day (have already mentioned the same in XUV700 thread). Excellent NVH levels - better than my 2018 Creta but I feel that it's on par with the XUV700 if not just slightly better. Smooth 360 degree camera feed and also front parking sensors (which were given a miss on the XUV700 by Mahindra). Ventilated Seats inbuilt from factory unlike in XUV700 where I've had to add it as an accessory. Auto-dimming IRVM - Missed this feature after upgrading from Creta since XUV700 despite its price has only manual IRVM. However, glad to have it back on the Seltos. No need to flip the IRVM up and down during nighttime Illuminated power window switches for front and back - was missing on my Creta 2018. Also, on the topic of power windows - all four doors get auto up-down feature which is a nice feature to have. Three point seatbelt for middle row passenger, as well as an adjustable headrest - something that is missing in XUV700. Paddle Shifters - Used it extensively on the 250km highway drive from the city to hometown and it was responsive and a joy to use. Auto-Headlamps and Wipers add to the convenience ADAS is a boon to use and has helped me a lot in the XUV700 and I'm sure it'll do the same on the Seltos. Kia Connect is much faster and easier to use compared to Adrenox. Also, the app doesn't endlessly keep on connecting to a server when sending a command. It works instantly. The Voice Assistant is so much better on the Seltos than Alexa on XUV700. Quick to execute commands and haven't had any command fail as of yet. DislikesCar's acceleration is on the slower side and it picks up speed linearly unlike the Creta (2018, 1.6L Diesel). Nothing wrong with the car but the car takes quite a long time to pick up speed. On a related note, 100kmph is reached at 2000rpm on 6th gear. I wish the car had a longer 6th gear. No light for the passenger side vanity mirror or the glovebox unlike in XUV700. Indicator stalks and wiper stalks do not get illumination which was problematic as I was driving a new car in the night time and had no idea where the Headlight ""ON"" position was and kept turning on the parking lamp instead. Headlights on the facelifted Seltos are average at best and I started to miss the excellent lights of the XUV700. 360 camera stitching especially on the left and right is not good unlike in XUV700. Also, no guidelines for the front camera and only guideline for top down view is possible. ADAS is intrusive at times and gets annoying unlike in XUV700. E.g. While trying to change lanes on the highway to avoid potholes, the steering brought me back to the previous lane and I had to go through several potholes. I turned off the Lane Keep Assist after that. Being used to ADAS on my XUV700, I thought the steering would vibrate and then let me turn since there were no cars behind me. So, I lightly turned the steering wheel (being used to the light steering of the XUV) but the car just brought me back to the previous lane. Also, the warnings that it keeps giving are ridiculous at times. When I headed out from the city, I had just exited the society's gate when the car gave me a warning to ""take a break"" - why would I want to take a break when I just started the car in the morning. Also, driving above 80, say around 85kmph or 90kmph, the car keeps giving me a warning to ""reduce speed"". Does anyone know any way to disable these warnings? Furthermore, multitude of options to control the ADAS suite make it confusing unlike XUV700 where everything is simple and well laid out. No Wireless AA/AC for top model while its available for lower trims. XUV700 has patchy AA/AC but atleast its there All Black Interiors are a letdown compared to the more beautiful interior on the HTX trim. While black would be easier to maintain, the all black interiors give the car a claustrophobic feeling (in my humble opinion - your opinion might vary) Sunglass Holder makes a rattling sound when driving over roads (both good and bad) - No such issue in my XUV700 or Creta. Sound system is average and sounds similar to my 2018 Creta minus the subwoofer. The front of the car has a USB Type-C as well as a USB Type-A port. However, AA and AC only works through the USB-A port; the type C port is for charging only. I have an iPhone 14 Pro Max and a Galaxy Z Fold 3 - one of them came with a Type-C to lightning connector and the other a Type-C to C connector. So, I was forced to search a computer store for Type-A to Type-C connector just so I could use Android Auto. I wish Kia had made the Type-C connector be the port for AA/AC instead of the Type-A port.

Good acceleration and engine response time. 2. Brakes are a bit too sharp, will take you by suprise the first few times. 3. Good fit and finish. 4. Suspension, though firm, I feel that it is a bit more comfier than Safari while going through expansion joints. I think the dampers are softer. 5. Steering is a breeze. Weighs up as it picks up speed. 6. Bose speakers are nowhere near JBLs in Safari. I can't pin point the reason, but I feel that some frequencies are compressed. Soundstage is an issue. 7. Headlights are ok and comparable to Safari. I did not drive in the rain where I felt Safari was bad and changed the fog lamps to a more powerful neutral colored LED. That option is not there here.

892, true_sedan , 17:00 ,BHPian,"I had a very unpleasant experience at Pressana Kia in Coimbatore. I had booked the GTX+ Diesel AT with Kcode on July 14 and was allotted one on September third week. I refused the first allotment in August as I was out of the station for two weeks and was not ready to buy a car without PDI or a test drive. After weeks of waiting, my dealership executive called me one fine day and asked me to come visit the showroom for a test drive. It was the first day of the new Seltos test drive and I wanted to try out the brand new car before it was abused. I went to the showroom at 3:30 PM with my wife, excited about trying out the car. But the brand new test drive car was not available or anywhere to be seen. It was taken to a temple for the traditional new car puja. The worst part was that the dealership executive gave a wrong commitment and fled the showroom when I arrived. I called him up and gave him an earful. I told him to bring the car to my home location for a test drive as I wouldn’t be coming back to the showroom. And the next day voila he brought the Petrol DCT instead of Diesel AT. He even tried to convince me that the performance of both cars are same. The sheer incompetence of the dealership executive was amazing and comical. He promised to get the diesel as soon as it was available but I never got that test drive. After this tryst with fate, I had forgotten about the Seltos booking as the XUV700 knocked the socks out of my feet with its performance. By then I had decided to cancel the Seltos not only because of the sedate nature of the diesel as reported by many in the forum but also because of the poor dealership experience. I called the showroom just to enquire about the status of the car to satisfy my curiosity. Another shocker. Apparently, my dealership executive had “resigned” from the job earlier that month. Another executive was assigned to my booking and he sounded polite at first. But as soon as I asked him to cancel my booking he turned cold. He stopped responding to my enquiry on how to proceed with the cancellation. He finally sent me one text - an email ID without explaining anything. How irrational dealership executives turn as soon as a customer cancels a booking. After three weeks of no communication from the dealership on my cancellation request, I finally complained to Kia customer care and all of a sudden things started to move at a frantic pace. The Customer Relationship Manager(CRM) reached out to me and apologised for the bad experience. My booking was cancelled on the same day and a cheque was given for the entire booking amount without deductions the next day. I had to go through Kia India customer care to move the dealership to cancel my booking. The overall experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I will certainly think twice before recommending Pressana Kia. PS: I received the refund in the form of a cheque and it demands a visit to the bank to get it encashed even for a booking done online with a debit card. This is supposedly the showroom policy.

I disagree with the mileage reported above. GTX+ DCT 1.5 Turbo is an absolute pleasure to drive. I drive in a bumper-to-bumper traffic with most of my driving in the famed Outer Ring Road, where we crawl at roughly 5km speed. I use ECO mode in city drive. You will be inclined to drive Sport mode to see the gush. But in a city like Bangalore, it is just a dream and will remain to be. So trying to keep it simple, it is just ECO mode in city. I get a mileage of 11-12kmpl. I did a highway trip of about 500kms as well. As the vehicle was still in engine break-in period, there was no spirited drive. I just kept changing speeds between 60-90 and refrained from doing a cruise control and not push RPM beyond 3000RPM. Completed my first service with a forced oil-change from my side on 1000kms (first free service), it was a strong insist from me to the SA and he agreed. The vehicle is an absolute delight to drive. DCT with paddle shifters option gives you the ""missed manual drive - driving pleasure"" feeling. My suggestion is just go for the turbo and you will not make any mistake. High spirited driving using Sport can be done after 2K kms and am sure you will see a smile in your face. I am just waiting for the 2K to finish in my ODO.

Having the AdBlue / DEF doesn't negate the DPF or it's clogging issue. For example, the bigger Diesel engines like the ones in XUV700, Compass, etc. came with DEF right from the start of BS-6; yet, we have seen numerous DPF clogging issues being reported here. The DEF / AdBlue doesn't prevent the soot accumulation in the DPF system, rather only aids in further reducing the 'harmful' emissions. Bottom rule is, if you have BS-6 Diesel it warrants a decent highway / higher rpm run to minimise the clogging issues. More importantly if the car sees city traffic quite often I see that you yourself have a Seltos D AT facelift & yet you don't know that it has a DEF tank that you mentioned in your earlier posts.

No doubt, diesel would be better if mileage is very important to anyone but diesel prices are not what they used to be and they come with their own issues - DPF filter clogging, possible govt restrictions later and higher engine noise etc. I would have rather bought an EV for city use and rented something like an innova, with or without driver, for inter-city travels, if I required driving 10+ KMs a day but that's just me.

916, VigneshMC , 20:25 ,BHPian,"I recently purchased a Kia Seltos HTK 2023 and have been driving it for about a month, covering approximately 1000 kilometers. To provide some context, we also own a 2017 Baleno, which I will use as a point of comparison in this review. The delivery experience at Capital Kia Chennai on September 21st left something to be desired. Despite my request for an early handover around 10:30 AM, I arrived slightly late at 10:35 AM due to morning rains. However, there were significant delays in their process, and I didn't leave the dealership until 12:45 PM. Furthermore, the vehicle wasn't adequately cleaned, both inside and out, despite the extended wait. Although I noticed this before departing, I chose not to raise the issue due to my time constraints. I later addressed this issue in their feedback call, and they offered to rectify it with a cleaning session. I declined and suggested that they pay attention to this during the first service. In the meantime, I embarked on a 1000-kilometer round trip, and here are my observations: Build: The build quality of the Seltos is noticeably superior to the Baleno, with well-weighted doors. Handling and Drivability: Despite its larger size compared to the Baleno and other hatchbacks I'm accustomed to, the Seltos offers ease of maneuverability. It also impresses with high-speed stability. The steering and clutch are notably better than the Baleno. Suspension: The suspension system is very effective, absorbing bumps with ease. Infotainment System: While the Seltos's infotainment system is competent, I found the Baleno's to be more user-friendly and refined. Nevertheless, I have no major complaints, and the wireless Android Auto works well. Audio output is acceptable. The Baleno's reverse camera outperforms the Seltos, particularly in low-light conditions. Performance: The Baleno's 1.2 engine feels a bit peppier than the Seltos's 1.5 NA petrol engine. However, this doesn't pose a significant issue. Lights: Though I haven't had extensive night driving experience, the Seltos's headlights felt somewhat inadequate. Baleno's projectors offer better illumination. Service Experience: I booked my first service for October 14th with Capital Kia through the KIA app on October 11th, and the process went smoothly, including a confirmation call the next day. However, I received a message on the 13th stating I needed to reschedule due to an unexpected maintenance activity. This was frustrating, given the prior confirmation. I eventually rescheduled for October 15th. Utilizing the pickup and drop service, I received the driver's details on the 14th and confirmed the pickup location. The car was picked up and delivered for service on time, complete with photos during pickup and delivery to the service center. Despite my specific request for interior cleaning, it was not properly addressed, and I found some areas were overlooked. Additionally, I inquired about upgrading my steel tires to alloys before my first service. I contacted a service advisor who requested my car number but did not respond, even after two weeks and multiple follow-up messages. During my first service, I was told that the accessories team was unavailable on Sundays. Compared to my consistent 10/10 service experiences with Maruti over the last six years, Kia charges for pickup and drop services, which Maruti does not. In conclusion, I'm satisfied with my decision to choose the Seltos. Although the delivery and service experiences with Kia have room for improvement, I've only had one service so far. I'll wait for additional experiences before forming a more concrete opinion.", 15th October 2023,kia-seltos,CHN/CBE,62,130,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative
917, shibujp , 22:32 ,Senior - BHPian,"Checked out the Seltos at Epitome KIA at Bangalore. While they did not have a TD the same day they were kind enough to provide me at a later date. I had been interested in the Seltos turbo petrol to replace the RS. I was expecially interested in a manual variant. The ommision of a manual variant is quite a miss I feel. Hope Hyundai bring out a manual in the Creta. Design, Looks and Interiors It's a mixed bag for me. I like the way the front has been cleaned up a bit. To me the old face was a little too busy and the new one has a cleaner look. I especially like the face of the GTX variant. The rear though I feel has too much of a Karens look to it and a bit tame. Overall the car looks a bit bulkier now and not in a good way. Interiors are very nice, good quality and quite similar to the old Seltos. A great change in that made to the instrument cluster which in now level with the top of the dash. The old one was a personal sore point for me. Some may not like the black interiors but it's fine with me. Powertrain Now to the meat of the matter. The change of heart to the 1.6 turbo petrol. The engine had good responsiveness in Sport mode. Felt it's a bit dull in Normal. The main gripe for me was the DCT. Try as I could I was not able to get into a rhythm with it. The engine holds too high revs in sport when downshifting while you brake. Also the revs take time to die down after you take your foot off the accelerator. One thing that helped was using the paddleshifts helped to smoothen out the power delivery in sport a lot. To high revs - shift up a gear. Too low - shift down. Contrast this with the AT in the 2017 Verna 1.6. I felt instantly at home and it felt so intuitive to me. Over the ruts and bumps of Banglore's road the suspension felt pliant and comfortable. Just a few rut and bumps filtered through. ADAS did not feel obstrusive and I liked the fact that it warned when someone was too close the front bumper. I think ADAS was off as I was able to follow cars quite close and overtake leaving relatively small gaps. I really loved the blind stop view when switching on the indicators. All in all a good change but not mind blowing for me by any stretch. A manual would have been a good feature. Would like to see what the Creta comes up with. A Creta N line would be my wish. Though I was really interested in the Seltos two very interesting cars landed up in my garage that replaced my RS. A used X1 20d and a Jimny. So a change would have to wait.

Most of the manufacturers do not provide any floor/boot mat by default with the car. Few dealers provide it as a complementary gift to promote sales. I have seen Hyundai dealers provide this with i10 Nios (not with every model). But in case of cars like Creta or Seltos, dealers are not bothered about customers as these cars are selling in good numbers every month.

Mileage on highway normal mode 16.1-18.5 and in Hills 8.8-10.3 Kml. I did an 850 km drive yesterday from Blr-Palakkad and back. I was very skeptical initially because a lot of people told me to wait for the first service before taking it on a long drive. However, the SA and service team at PPS Kia, Bangalore told me that these modern BS-6 vehicles don't have a limitation as such. Decided to go for it, and got my first service done in Palakkad itself in the middle of my trip so that I could test the sports mode properly on my way back. The Owner's manual only talks about keeping the RPM in the range of 2000-4000 for the first 1000 km - which the DCT gearbox makes sure of. I don't think going beyond 3500 is possible unless you are using paddle shifters. Any opinion on this? On the drive, no backaches/discomfort at all - it was a breeze. The take-a-break warning is annoying and random. I am trying to figure out what the logic could be so that I can work around it. ADAS is helpful and not-so-helpful at the same time. There are so many unmarked sections on the Blr-Salem-Coimbatore highway that you have to keep switching on and switching off all the time. I did put the brakes to test as well once because of a Kia Sonet driving in front of me almost ramming into the diversion board in front of it.

Useful when there are multiple drivers at home. Other missing features in IVT are ADAS, Ventilated seats, EPB, Hill Hold, Wireless charging, Bose speakers - Of course all these are good, but I don't think will miss much on these. Too much complicated electronics, additional maintenance. 5) NVH levels are very good compared to Creta IVT. 6) Creta IVT has all the above features, with dated looks though (personal opinion) 7) Just wish Seltos IVT had one more higher variant with at least some of the missing features in GTX+.", 27th October 2023,kia-seltos,Bangalore,134,33,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

The entire process took 1.5 hours (1 hr PDI, 30 mins of discussing documents, insurance, accessories) PDI - It was smooth from both zekardo and kia's end. The engineer checked everything when i was busy fiddling with the sound system, sunroof, seats, etc which were checked by him too. I kept asking every 10 mins if there's anything wrong to which he assured that all looks good and i should be content! I did find one issue that's with the sunroof opening and closing - I believe someone else had the same issue and they were able to reset it. Can someone confirm how to go about it? Booked the PDI via Zekardo (quick note for whoever considering it, they have 3 slots 930am, 130pm, 430pm). Sometimes there can be a delay at the engineer's previous PDI, so best to connect with the engineer to see if everything is on track for yours. Accessories - My SA was bit pushy on the accessories but i straight up said no to whatever i didn't want. Ended up taking the 3D boot mat, 3D foot mat, coaster, Tissue box. Insurance - was quoted 72k, he agreed on 45k. I came home and asked which company he mentioned Zuno or something which i rejected and asked from Tata AIG. I sent my quote and they matched it exactly with a difference of couple 100 rs so i went ahead with them. BH registration process has been initiated.

While I'm OK with the stiff ride 18 inchers seem to have, the only worry is the 'side-wall' ratio. 215/55 means a lower side wall which is susceptible to ruptures or side wall cracks. Case in point: A similar issue came up with Ford Ecosport when they introduced the Titanium+ with 205/50/R17, there were hundreds of report of side-wall bulging and tyre bursts as they could not handle the bad roads, pot holes.

Like connecting to Android Auto or Apple CarPlay wireless on my XUV700, we just need to connect to the Carlinkit dongle which acts as an interface between the car and our phones and that's it. The next time you start your car, the phone will automatically connect to Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. Due to force of habit of using Android Auto in XUV700 (thanks to the unreliable nature of Apple Carplay over there), I tried out Android Auto wireless through the Carlinkit Dongle only. In terms of lag, there is little to none. On my XUV700, the wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay is somewhat laggy, which I assumed was due to the wireless connection but wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay works without any issues through Carlinkit on the Seltos. Perhaps, the Carlinkit dongle has a better processor than the XUV700 which enables it to stream content without any issues. My phone remained at normal temp throughout the entire drive - with GPS on. No difference using Carlinkit or the inbuilt Android Auto / Apple CarPlay wireless function on my XUV700. Battery life will definitely take a hit but that's the same whether you use Carlinkit or inbuilt wireless Android Auto / Apple CarPlay. The dongle doesn't take up much space and I have uploaded a picture of the same. For reference, it's about the size of my Airpods Pro. On the Kia Seltos, whether it's wired or wireless Android Auto / Apple CarPlay, the phone dialer doesn't come up when we press the dial button (call receive) on the steering. This is in contrast to my XUV700 and Creta which bring up the dialer when I press the dial button on my steering wheel.

Being an Audiophile, the Bose Speakers sounded very ordinary to me. It sounded muddy and missing the deep bass. According to me, it was not even close to Infinity/JBL speaker system of Hector, Harrier. In fact, I felt the speakers of Honda City is even better. So thought of checking the actual drivers/speakers inside the doorpad. To my surprise, I noticed front Speakers are 6.5"" whereas the rear speakers are 5.25"" (for cost-cutting) with Bose logo under Kia/Hyundai branding. And I don't think the actual price of these speakers would be not more than 3-4k as they are very ordinary speakers. I did not change these Speakers because of the fear of losing the warranty (even though I wanted to and ideally it should not void warranty). Instead, I installed damping pads on all 4 doors, after which the sound improved a lot. Upon checking in team-bhp I found many users have already reported the same.

I have not checked the amplifier of Bose models and non-Bose models. Hence can not comment. But I believe there is no sub in the None-Bose model. Hence I assume there is no additional amp in none-Bose mode. I will suggest installing good 6.5"" co-axial speakers (Infinity, DLS or Polk speakers) in front as well as in rear doors. This will give you very good sound stage without a sub (Better than Bose).

Quote: Originally Posted by SeniorC The Australian version had ADAS as standard in base variant too. Additionally, the build quality might have been different of vehicles sold there. It is not really about production differences, because the Australian/North American Seltos that comes from Korea is a completely different car altogether, I believe on the Soul's platform. It is larger, has different powertrains and interiors, and different structural parts entirely (even in shape and location). It is simply not the same car with some structural differences (eg. Swift) but rather a different car with the same name and looks. Using the ANCAP rating for India would be like using the Renault Captur's Euro NCAP rating for the Indian one: they are completely different cars that just look the same, so it doesn't make sense.

Hey, even I had a very unpleasant experience in KUN Kia, Chennai. I was evaluating cars around 1.5 years ago, and had shortlisted the Kia Seltos, Volkswagen Taigun, MG Astor and the Hyundai Creta. I went there to check out the Seltos for the first time. I was assigned an executive only after 15-10 mins of waiting, even though there were barely 4-5 people in the showroom. The executive seemed very friendly and helpful at the first, offered us tea, water and coffee, etc... Later, when we told him that we were just looking at the car for the first time and not planning to buy for sure, his body language completely changed. He started to be irresponsive, checked out his Instagram (I'm not hyping, he actually did that!) and give short and unhelpful answers. I was with my family (wife and 2 kids) when all this happened and we were utterly disrespected. When we were about to walk out of the showroom, the senior executive came to us, apologizing for their staff's behavior. I gave them a second chance and decided to take a take drive of the 1.5L DCT, only on them insisting. But, unfortunately, I was assigned the same executive who had disrespected me all along, as the senior executive's reply was that they were 'short-staffed', though I noticed 3-4 executives sitting freely in the lounge, all of them buried in their phones. I half-heartedly went for the test drive. Even in the test drive, the executive was not at all interested in answering my queries. Our conversation was something like this: Me: What is the difference between the AT and the DCT gearbox? Him: AT is slow, DCT is fast. Me: What is the price of the GTX+ variant? Him: Am I looking at it every second? How am I supposed to know it by-heart? Me: What is the function of this button in the steering wheel? (Pointing to the I-call button) Him: Go and read the manual of the car. At this point, I was completely pissed off. I parked the car in the road (about 2-3 km from the showroom), got off with my family, took an auto to our house (which is 12 km away) and posted an utterly bad review about the showroom in google maps. 3 days later, their back-end team had seen the review and wanted to apologize. I gave them an earful and cut the call. I can't imagine how car companies would treat us for the sake of selling a car. If we aren't interested in a car doesn't mean we can't see it right?

1026, ginxtonic , 01:14 ,Newbie,"End-to-end experience of our Seltos Facelift (GTX+ DCT) -------------------- Got the car delivered to me and my family on Nov 1st!! Within 5 weeks of the booking date to the committed 15-16 weeks - which is honestly remarkable IMO. Listing down my entire booking and pre-delivery, delivery and experience till date with our Pewter Olive GTX+ DCT. A. Booking and pre-delivery Reached out to Frontier Kia first, we weren't impressed by their handling and proactiveness - so contacted Jayanti KIA and it was probably a great decision keeping in mind that we had absolutely 0 issues or niggles with the entire experience. Booked in the last week of September, the SA came to our house to take the booking. We paid 25k amount and then waited till we were messaged around oct 3rd week to get the CSD procedure initiated as the car is available to be allotted within a week. TBH i thought there's something fishy as its been less than 1 month since the booking (p.s. there was nothing as such). The SA was throughout communicative and responsive to all our questions. PDI was scheduled, via Zekardo (in detail in post #975). All smoothly done, delivery was scheduled for 4 days later as BH registration from RTO office took a while due to public holidays -------------------- B. Delivery Car was ready for us. Looked gorgeous. Paid for the accessories, logged into MyKia and Kia Connect. Kia Connect didn't work for first 1 week, they fixed something on the back end - however it still wasn't fixed at my end. I called the customer care through the website number and they helped me figure it out and its now connected end-to-end. Took delivery of the car, turned off forward collision warning, had barely any petrol so got that filled too. -------------------- C. Experience till now Drive - Driven around 350kms only. For city (delhi) errands i can't seem to get my head around not taking out my i10 for many a reasons so our Seltos hasn't been getting much runtime. What a beast of a machine, idk if i'm biased or the delta from my 10 yr old i10 is that great but driving the turbo petrol dct is just so fun and easy. Pick up is great, power delivery is great - bare minimum lag is there but just about to the limit to not hamper those split-second decisions. Can reach 80kmph is absolutely no time without the slightest of discomfort or hesitance. Overall mileage to date has been 9.9/10 KMPL. Driving was completely in the city with probably a stretch of 2-3km once or twice in the past 2 weeks without any traffic or stoppages. Space - Front seats are extremely comfortable, viewing angle height everything works for me / my family. Back seats are decent at best, leg room is more than adequate, however centre seat is stiff. The least recline angle is a bit too much as it eats up into the boot space. Boot space could've been a bit more i feel the 433L tag isn't justified due to the dimensions. Features / Functionalities 360 deg cam: I can't drive any decently sized car without a 360 camera due to its sheer convenience. I use it in case im in a tight spot just to be sure that as i've turned off most DAW features. I take longer in my i10 to reverse out of my parking spot than the seltos due to the ease it provides (I'm not a relatively new driver, have been driving for over 9-10 years). Auto hold: makes you feel like we're karting - that system is best made for Indian roads and traffic. Maps / Navigation: POOR. Quite unintuitive, lacks many basic locations, gives out multiple results with bare minimum tagging to be able to select the right destination. The route choices are questionable too. As someone who has more screentime of google maps than say instagram - this is something that really put me off. Having to use my phone to navigate isn't ideal or safe. Kia Connect app: can start, stop the engine, AC, honk all remotely. More than that we can pre-send our location to the car and upon entry just gotta select the location on the popup for direction. Also gives the absolute peace of mind in case of key being left inside we can remotely unlock it. Dual zone AC: was under the impression that it might be a gimmick but came in handy on the 2nd day on the drive itself when my co-passenger was feeling cold whereas i was driving with 19C and ventilated seats. Wireless charging: Great utility, and speed of charging is impressive. Keyless entry: Auto unfolding of SVM and unlocking of door is great and honestly gives me the kicks. Lacks memory seat option which would have been great but not complaining. Sunroof: Shade (only, not the glass) is open 24/7, gives an airy feel to the cabin. However one-touch functionality isn't working but i can't be bothered to get it fixed as it's not adding any discomfort. -------------------- D. Summary - Can't be happier with the choice we've made vis-a-vis the other cars (creta, kushaq, slavia, xuv700, harrier) that were in our consideration bucket. Ticks all the boxes, gives you joy upon driving and any thing that feels could have been there is completely overshadowed by the abundance of the host of must-have features that this car provides.

I had test-driven them upon the initial launch of the Seltos back to back, I had driven the Verna first and it was surely the more sportier of the two, and the Seltos later, which had the usual issues associated with the SUV body style like body roll and the stiff suspension against the more compliant one in the Verna. In my opinion, if you are after a fast and fun sedan, the Verna is the way to go, else if the SUV body style is more important, then go for the Seltos. Our family members were not in favor of the sedan and favored the Seltos due to ease of ingress and egress, better ground clearance, and looks.", 13th November 2023,kia-seltos,Muscat,712,"2,212","Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

Hi, I have done the PPF installation on my Seltos from Fortify Car Care, Banaswadi, Bangalore. They recommended me MAXDECAL brand PPF because of the brand warranty claim policy in replacing the panel film across India. Hence, I have installed MAXDECAL PPF film for my car, which comes with a 5-year warranty. They quoted me 95K for full car and 80K without the roof(i.e. PPF on the body and Ceramic coating on the roof). Since 80% of the roof is occupied by Sunroof, they recommended having Ceramic coating done which has reduced cost by 15k.

1041, bizi05 , 12:43 ,BHPian,"Hi Folks, last weekend I went on a trip, i.e. from Bangalore to Mysore then to Wayanad clocking 730 Kilometers. Thought of sharing my drive experience of my Seltos 1.5T Petrol GTX+. So far I have driven 1200 km and the first service is scheduled on 18th Nov. Drive Experience 1. Suspension - Still it is on the stiffer side if I compare it with Creta. This helps in highway stability, body roll is well-controlled but at the same time, pothole jerks are felt inside the cabin. 2. Steering - It is very good in city driving conditions and accurate on highways. I did not find any issues with Steering feedback. Comparing the Steering feedback of Seltos with Kushaq 1.5T petrol, I would say, the difference is minimal (not like day and night) 3. Braking - The brake is really good and it will never make you feel nervous 4. Seating Comfort - According to me, the Seating comfort is OK. My height is 6ft and it lacks under-thigh support for tall passengers. Also, lumbar support could have been better. 5. Engine/Transmission Performance - Here I am not really impressed by the 1.5 Turbo Petrol Engine and transmission duo. In Stop and go traffic, it lags a lot in quick acceleration in initial gears. Once it reaches to 3rd gear, it pulls well. But during initial gears (1 & 2) I have to press hard on the accelerator (have to literally stand on the accelerator, i,e. when the accelerator is pressed more than 60-70%) to get the initial pull. Not sure whether it is an issue only with my car. Please let me know if others noticed this as well. Normal Mode - I have mostly driven in Normal and Sports mode. In Normal mode I observed the gear shift is very quick, it upshifts as soon as the RPM is about to reach 2000. Result in linear acceleration. Sports Mode - It holds the gear for some more time till the RPM reaches 2500 and then it upshifts. But lags during initial Gears, i,e. in stop-and-go traffic scenarios. Adaptive Cruise control - Liked this feature and it is useful on highways. Observed one thing, if the Speed limit is Set through Cruise Control and the car has reduced the speed because of a slow-moving vehicle in front of Seltos in the same lane, then changing the lane, the car pulls aggressively. 6. Alert Warning - The vehicle keeps displaying ""Consider taking a break"" warning message every 15-20 mins interval. There is no setting to disable this warning message. I called Kia customer care. But they could not help, instead, they redirected me to the Service Manager of Epitome Kia. The Service manager is clueless about this Warning message and the Service Manager asked me to take the car to the Service center for an inspection. They wanted to see the warning message. Seltos model sold outside India has a setting to reduce the Alert level and even completely turn it off. Hope they fix this in future software upgrades. 7. Visibility - Overall visibility is good but the Speaker Grill on the Dashboard reflects a lot during the daytime. 8. AC - AC is very good. But there is no way to control/reduce the Rear AC or close the Rear AC Vents. 9) Music System - As mentioned in my earlier post, the rear speaker misses the punch as the volume is 60% less compared to the front speakers. This is because the rear Bose speaker is a 5.25"" driver vs 6.5"" front driver. 10) Mileage - On the Bangalore-Mysore highway the MID showed fuel economy of 19.7 kmpl and inside city, the MID showed fuel economy between 7-13 kmpl. On tank to tank method, I got an average of 17.5 kmpl (80% Highway and 20 % City.

The reason given by the SA makes absolutely no sense, as you booked your car in September. If you had booked in October end or this month, what the SA said would have held true, as OEMs reduce production capacities towards December end. The MT variants of the Seltos, are also not in high demand, so that could also be a factor, anyways since you booked in September and assuming the car you booked was not already allocated to someone else, you should get your car allotted to you this year itself, so you can either choose to accept it or wait till next year, but it will entail a price hike for sure, but you get one made in 2024, which helps with better resale value.

While the shop was right in pushing you to get the amplifier, im afraid they might not have explained why you needed one so badly. The alpine speakers, based on a quick google search, need 100 watts of rms power, putting it at the higher end of the entry level speaker spectrum. Combine this with the factory amp putting out 10-20 watts per channel (probably), you can see why you have to turn the volume all the way up. When you told the shop that you weren’t getting an amp, what they should have done is recommend a different set of speakers that can play beautifully at 50-60W RMS which the factory amp can sort of drive. You would still need an amp but things wouldn't be so bad. Pioneer makes an amp for about 17-18k that can deliver over a 100W per channel.

1070, tauk2mi , 13:31 ,Newbie,"I wanted to share my experience of purchasing the Kia Seltos facelift GTX+ after having owned the same variant for the past four years. I was an early buyer of the Kia Seltos GTX+ DCT in sparkling silver when it launched back in 2019. The car was acquired through my company's car lease program, but due to the pandemic, I didn't get to drive it much. Over four years, I managed just 40,000 kilometers. As the car lease program concluded, I deliberated and eventually sold it for a great price. I used the proceeds to repay a housing loan, slashing the interest outflow by nearly 70 lakhs and reducing the tenure by 7 years! The monthly EMI I was used to didn't dictate my next financial move, so I opted for the new facelift version of the Seltos GTX+, unable to find a comparable alternative within my budget. I made a personal booking in early September to avoid a long wait. The process, however, took longer than expected due to the asset retirement and ownership transfer, taking almost a month. Eventually, I submitted the purchase application at the office, which took an additional 2-3 weeks due to various stakeholders. Finally, the payment was made to the dealer, and the car was ready for pickup. I changed the color choice thrice during the waiting periodfrom pewter olive to steel silver and finally to imperial blue. Red wasn't an option, as our apartment already boasts three vehicles in that color. The day of collection arrived after completing registrations and formalities. I preferred a simple and neat ceremony, instructing no garlands, poojas, or ribbons, and requested the removal of plastics. I added a 7D mat and a 3D boot mat as accessories but steered clear of additional chrome since, in my opinion, it detracts from the car's appearance. Surprisingly, this is the first time in 20 years of driving that I didn't take a test drive or see the vehicle in person beforehand. Here's a summary of my car history over the past four years: Maruti 1000 (used), silver Esteem, beige Honda City, automatic Honda City, Seltos 2019 (sparkling silver), and now Seltos 2023 (imperial blue) - all top end variants! The only disappointment I encountered with this car was the pre-installed Apollo tires; everything else, from the overall booking to the delivery experience, was flawless. Having driven both variants, here's my breakdown of what I find different and better. The engine operates incredibly smoothly, delivering power precisely when needed. Noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) levels are exceptionally well-managed. Kia's insulation against outside noise is impressiveI could hardly tell the engine was running even at higher RPMs. The Bose speaker system outshines the previous version by far. Even my daughter, who's the primary DJ in the car, agrees. I'm confident it'll suffice, especially if I follow the advice of some fellow car enthusiasts to dampen the doors. Activating Kia Connect was effortless; it began working from day one. I only had to contact Kia Care to remove the previous vehicle, which they did proactively before the new car arrived. I noticed that the lumbar support in the previous model was slightly better, but I don't experience any discomfort with the new seats. The interior feels incredibly spacious despite the black color scheme, which doesn't detract from its appearance or make it seem smaller. The panoramic sunroof adds to the roomy, airy feel inside. Rear passengers now get to enjoy the weather outside, particularly during rainy days. The car utilizes space efficiently, with covered cupholders and various slots for storing a mobile phone or wallet. The dashboard resembles a cockpit with all essential controls, beautifully designed. The themed approach for different driving modesnormal, sport, eco, or dynamicis neat. The Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) are a boon; adaptive cruise control and lane assist are both cool and very helpful. These features aren't for aggressive drivers, as the systems encourage disciplined driving. Of course, you can always disable them if they're not your preference. If you're not accustomed to indicating before changing lanes, you might find it irritating as the car attempts to guide you back into the lane when this setting is enabled. The 360-degree camera and sensors activate automatically in city traffic. It's a fantastic feature that helps avoid scratches and maintain a safe distance. I used to activate this manually in the previous car, but now it's automatic. The air conditioning is adequate and comfortable. Dual-zone settings cater to both driver and passenger preferences for different climate settings. The car's height can pose challenges for the car cleaning personnel; it's tall, limiting their reach to certain spots. On the very first day, I switched out the Apollo tires for Yokohama 225/55 R18. I managed to get 28k for the Apollo tires. Despite options like Continental and Bridgestone, I opted for Yokohama. Depending on the lighting and surroundings, the car in imperial blue displays various huesshifting between black, dark blue, and occasionally even hints of purple!

1077, bizi05 , 23:54 ,BHPian,"With my limited knowledge, I can say that it is very unlikely that using thicker or heavier metal sheets in the bonnet or doors will significantly improve the car body shell's strength or structure, which would result in a better safety rating. While it will undoubtedly add some additional strength to the car, it is not a significant factor in crash test performance. Based on this logic, one might assume that the Honda Elevate would score only 2-3 stars. This is because when I tried lifting the bonnet of the Honda Elevate, I realized that its weight is more or less similar to that of the Maruti Swift (and significantly lighter than the Kia Seltos). However, many auto experts believe that the Elevate will still garner a 5-star rating, as it is built on the same Honda City platform, which has already received a 5-star rating. However, I did compare the bonnet weight of the pre-facelift Seltos (2023 manufactured) and the facelift Seltos during my first visit to a Kia showroom. Upon lifting the bonnet of both models, I found that the weight is more or less the same. The difference in door weight was also miniscule, with the facelift version feeling slightly heavier, but this could be due to other factors.", 21st November 2023,kia-seltos,Bangalore,43,109,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Positive

Quote: Originally Posted by NFS2024 That's a great update you have provided. One key question remains. Having driven both the models, how has your ride quality experience been? Is it better by a mile from the previous model? or has the tire change resulted in a cushy ride? The earlier Seltos model was equipped with Goodyear 215/60 R17 tires from the start. I hadn't initially opted to upgrade them, so I had to stick with them for 30k kilometers. After switching to Michelin Primacy 215/60 R17, based on advice from fellow BHPians, I was pleasantly surprised by the enhanced ride quality, improved braking in both wet and dry conditions, reduced noise levels, and overall performance. I regretted not making this change when I first purchased the car. To avoid repeating the same oversight, I shifted to Yokohama on day 1 since Michelin wasn't available in this size. The transition from Apollo to Yokohama occurred within just 5 kilometers, so I can't definitively attribute the improved ride quality solely to the change in tires. Nonetheless, after driving the car for an additional 200 kilometers post the tire replacement (including 30 minutes on a 4-lane highway and the rest on the city roads), I have to admit the ride quality is significantly better than before. With the tire pressure set at 33, the car doesn't feel bumpy on potholes, the thud sounds are minimal, it glides smoothly through city roads akin to a boat, and the engine feels more refined with almost negligible noise levels.", 22nd November 2023,kia-seltos,Chennai,19,58,Body Exterior and Paint,Very Positive

1082, thesilentone , 15:54 ,BHPian,"Just an update after 2000 kms and getting to know the car a little better. I was abroad for about 6 weeks and tried out remote start just to prevent the car from being idle for a long period of time. I was positively surprised when I could start the car remotely even from a faraway country through Kia Connect app. I had set the running period for 3 minutes and the engine shut off at the exact time. I thought I neednt depend on somebody to keep starting the car at periodical intervals when I am not available, but there is catch. The car should be started within a time period of 168 hours (1 week) and also the car should have been started manually previously, so we cannot do away completely with somebody to start the car in our absence but at least we can reduce the physical presence to alternate starts. The car is behaving predictably and I do not find much to complain. The petrol mileage averages between 8 and 11 kmpl (as per the instrument panel) which is what one can reasonably expect in Chennai city so I am fine with that. The lowest I have seen was 3.5 kmpl when I was in a huge traffic pileup for about an hour and was constantly keeping my eye on the temperature gauge. However, there was no problem whatsoever probably due to the auto hold function which was a real boon. There are a few negatives which I would like to point out just so that people can be aware. After driving the Seltos extensively and then going back to drive my Creta was when I could perceive the big difference in ride quality. The more than one lakh kilometers run Creta suddenly felt so comforting. Well, one cant have everything. Looks like I might have to look at a change in footwear earlier than anticipated. Another negative for me is the lack of a mute button. When someone in the car gets a call or when I need to pause the radio, I have to scroll down the volume button to minimize the radio sound. A simple mute button would have been so much more practical. Even in the option to assign functions to the star button, surprisingly there is no mute option. I would be thankful if anyone could point out if I am missing anything in this regard. For me, the biggest pain is the rear cross traffic alert. If I forget to turn it off while starting, it just refuses to let me reverse into the road, constantly beeping traffic alerts from either side and brakes by itself if I dont heed the alerts. It beeps even when vehicles are crossing in the opposite lane. It seems to have been calibrated very aggressively. The worst part is it cannot be turned off permanently and will be active every time the car is started. Overall, I am happy with the car and should serve me well for a few years.", 22nd November 2023,kia-seltos,Chennai,266,326,Interior/Instrument Panel/Material Quality (broken or difficult to use),Negative

Things to keep in mind while taking Delivery? 5. Any other suggestions are welcome Thank you !! Congratulations on your new purchase and welcome to the Seltos family I bought mine from ASB Sahibabad and the entire experience was butter smooth. Not once did the dealer insist me on purchasing anything from them, although I could see a little bit of disappointment on the SA's face during delivery when I told him that I am not buying anything from them To answer your question: 1. Insurance - I bought directly from Acko @34K with 3-4 add-ons. The whole experience was super cool and the sales guys were extremely helpful and professional. Happy to share details if you choose to go ahead with Acko and have questions. I have used Acko two years in a row on my old car, once making an accident claim. That experience was extremely smooth as well. 2. The quality of accessories, at the price charged by dealer, is nothing to write about. You will get better quality accessories from outside, at lesser cost (of course if you go for premium stuff, cost will be appreciably in higher range) I bought GTX+, so there are some additional company fitted accessories like Mud-guards, which I think HTX does not have. So you will have to make a list of must haves and good to haves. I guess, foot/boot mats & screen guard are a must. I bought all three aftermarket. Quite satisfied with the quality. If you are going for black colour, PPF is must. 3. I didn't buy extended warranty or my convenience. Didn't find value as my average running per month/year is less than average. 4. Get independent PDI done, preferably a day before delivery. If you are taking the delivery late afternoon/evening, I would suggest you check-out the car in the morning once at the dealer. (During one of my visits few days before delivery, I noticed a ready to deliver car stationed outside the showroom and visitors checking it inside out at will). All the best with your delivery.

1102, arcanec , 19:20 ,BHPian,"Purchase experience of a new petrol Seltos GTX+ The backstory I've been a fan of the Seltos ever since its release in 2019. Back then, I'd bought the GTX+ MT as a retirement present for my dad and two of the things that sealed the deal in favor of the Seltos were: 1. The sheer amount of tech in the car and Kia's attention to detail in the car interiors 2. The showroom experience at Automotives De Cristal in Goa Creature comforts like ventilated seats and useful driving aids like the 360° camera really imprinted on me back at a time when no other car in the segment came anywhere close to this offering. What I didn't like much about the car were the blocky binnacle and the rather stiff suspension. When I saw the facelift with the refreshed binnacle and retuned suspension, not to mention even more tech thrown in with ADAS, I knew it was time to take the plunge and say a fond farewell to Kelly the Kwid, my trusty sidekick of almost 7 years. Early promising signs While I had my heart set on the Seltos, I thought it'd be remiss of me to not at least give the other cars in the segment a fair fighting chance. Among these, the Taigun's driving dynamics strongly tempted me, but the interiors felt a couple of steps down from the Seltos. JSP Kia at Marathahalli ORR was just a couple km down the road from my residence so I went there with stars in my eyes and a ready checkbook. Initial impression of the showroom was...underwhelming but, in my mind, irrelevant. What I wanted was a hassle-free purchase experience and a good solid car to enjoy for the next half decade or so. Oh boy. As this section header indicates, early signs were promising. The SA agreed to my terms of: 1. No payment beyond the booking amount before getting a PDI 2. Matching the insurance quote I received from outside or accepting that I'd buy the insurance myself 3. Installing a dual channel dashcam (which he said they'd do free of charge) While sorely tempted by the matte finish X-Line with its blacked out elements, research on teamBHP made me decide against it. After agonizing over the decision between a pewter olive, imperial blue, and the good ole black, I decided to go with the Pewter Olive GTX+ Turbo Petrol DCT. Is it just me or is there a sudden upsurge in the number of olive/khaki/bottle green cars of late? The amount of chrome on the exterior is still a bit much for my liking and I'd look at ways to dechrome the car maybe a year or so down the line. Even with all the chrome bits, the Seltos in this color is definitely a stunner in my utterly non-biased opinion. On October 17th, I put down the booking token and that's when things started to go a bit pear shaped. A rude awakening and bit of a rant N.B. For those of you who know how to deal with dealerships, you may want to skip this section or take the opportunity to laugh at a naive buyer. For those who are considering buying the car, especially from the dealership mentioned, you may want to read on. JSP Kia's booking confirmation email had the following disclaimer in bold: Quote: Any verbal commitments given at the time of booking will be invalid and only written commitment according to the booking will be considered. Kinda sus, but let's trust the SA. Mistake! More on this soon. I sat back expecting to get the car somewhere towards the end of November as communicated by the SA. Instead on October 27th, I got a call from him saying the car has been allocated and that I should make the payment. Eh? Payment? Recall point 1 above? Anyway, as the showroom was close by, I popped in for a visit. The SA tells me they need to lock in the price before the month-end, and that the car has been allocated to me. On my insistence, he even shared a VIN number with me and said it's a Kia policy that I've to pay the ex-showroom amount at least. I spoke to Kia's customer care on the call, and they said that as the car has been allocated, I could choose to pay. I...did, and the SA promised delivery of the car by Nov 8th. Here's where the real fun begins. The following Monday I got 3 calls from the JSP Kia sales team in the span of half an hour. First the SA tells me they'll issue the invoice later that day due to issues with their backend system. A few minutes later, his manager calls me saying that the car delivery will be delayed as the car hasn't been dispatched yet by Kia. On my insistence, he agreed to refund the amount paid, for which he'd need a cancelled check from me. While I was drafting the reply to this, I get a call from his manager saying the car will be delivered latest by the 10th and that I could do a PDI on the coming weekend (Nov 4th). Talk about manic Mondays, eh? Lesson learnt, folks. Don't ever EVER pay a paisa above the booking token before you see the car in person. The PD""I"": On the scheduled PDI day, I arrive at the stockyard to see a filthy car. Honestly, I wouldn't have known if the vehicle was olive, blue, or pink under the layer of dust. Saw Naara Kia dealer stickers on the read windshield and a PETROL sticker on the fuel cover. Looked at the VIN number and sure enough, it was different from the VIN of the vehicle supposedly allocated to me. To add to the fun, the Bangalore turned from sunny skies to a thunderstorm in the span of 5 minutes (mirroring my inner mental state) making further examination impossible. Headed back to the showroom to give the team a piece of my mind. Surprise surprise, the Sales Manager put the blame squarely on the shoulders of the SA and put on a bit of performance art scolding him for the VIN number being miscommunicated to me and not having the car cleaned before I visited. Owing to my limited Kannada comprehension, I only caught snippets of ""first impression, best impression"", ""again same story"", in that 5 minute performance. He then got the car to the showroom so I could do a proper PDI. Of a car still streaked with mud spots in the evening shade and drizzle. Inspection indeed. The delivery experience At this point, I started putting everything on mail and I'm glad I did. The SA committed to deliver the car on Nov 11th with the whole delivery period taking 45-60 minutes. I arrived on schedule to see a green color car dusty both inside and out. Who's surprised? At this point, I wasn't. Took them a couple of hours to get the car cleaned and ready, with the dashcam installed. The PETROL sticker on the fuel cover was still there, which I raised with the SA who then proceed to remove it, scratching the metal cover in the process. Of course, they didn't have the mats I'd ordered available either. The SA told me they'd arrange for the mats the next week and that he'd replace the fuel lid free of charge as well as a ""goodwill gesture"". Uhuh. Remembering JSP Kia's disclaimer, I demanded this in writing, and all in all, after spending about 2.5hrs there, left the showroom in a pretty foul mood after the mandatory delivery pictures. Can't hide the excitement on my face after this experience This has turned into an insanely long post, so I appreciate it if you've stuck on so far. A couple of fun post sales nuggets to keep it concise: 1. I get a call from the SA (not his official number) a couple days later saying I need to pay for the dashcam installation. Told him I have it on mail that the installation would be free of charge. He immediately disconnected. 2. The scratched fuel cover was to be replaced on Nov 13th. Anticipating their delays I decided to call the SA on the 16th to check on that and the mats, only for him to tell me that the cover was arranged but since I didn't come in, they used it for another customer. How many fuel covers are you damaging, Kia? Ownership experience so far In the ~300km I've driven I've had little to complain about apart from the experience with the dealership. As I'm regularly forced to reverse out of my parking on to a road, I find the reverse parking assist really handy after getting over the initial shock of the auto-applied brake. Likewise with the blind spot assist. The 360 camera is a boon and I find it easier to park/maneuver this 4.3m car than my old trusty compact hatchback. Coming from a manual, the DCT feels butter smooth apart from a bit of hesitancy at ~20-30kmph more so when coupled with an evident turbo lag. This is less so when using the paddle shifters. Considering my frame of reference is a 7-yr old entry-level hatchback, everything about this car feels incredible. More discerning drivers may find the tyres subpar or the suspension not as pliant as some others in the category, but I can't say I've found either to be problematic. The seat does lack a bit in underthigh support, but I don't find it concerning for my daily drives. Here's hoping for many happier miles with this beast.", 24th November 2023,kia-seltos,Bengaluru,31,46,All-Wheel/4-Wheel Drive,Very Positive

Yes, you can upgrade but you need to procure Bose Speakers from outside (offline stores) or from online genuine accessories shop like boodmo as Service center guys will not provide you Bose Speakers if your car variant is not GTX/XLINE variant. But is it worth upgrading to Bose Speakers? My answer is ""No"". You will get better speakers such as Infinity or DLS at the same price. Anyway changing speaker from Arkamys to Bose will void warranty. So my suggestion will be either don't change the speaker or go for a better speaker rather than bose.

1173, rajat_dehli , 22:19 ,Newbie,"Prologue I was driving a Vitara Brezza ZDI+ (2016) for the past 6.5 years. Absolute gem on a vehicle. Ban of BS4 diesel private cars in Delhi has been a bummer for past 2 years. NGT rule of 10 years of fitness made me think to switch to EV or petrol. Stumbled upon the Seltos facelift and fell in love with it. Extensive test drives and this forum sealed the deal for me. Old car selling experience: I was not ready to sell the car to any local vendor. Got the evaluation done by Maruti True Value, Cars24, Spinny. Maruti True value: Person seemed to make his own money. Offered 5L but said will transfer money via cheque after 15 days. Denied straight away. Cars24: offered 4.68. But they were going to deduct 8.5k (service charges). I asked for a higher price and they max offered 4.91L. Spinny: offered 4.68L but without any charges. 5k would be OTP hold which will be transferred once the car is re-registered. Unsatisfied, I called Mahindra first choice. Evaluation was done within 2 hours. Later, was offered 5.10L. Straight away agreed. 5K was transferred and the next day the same evaluation guy came for pickup. Did all the formalities and before key handover, 5L was transferred. 5K is on OTP hold. Overall the best selling experience. Book / Wait / Delivery: I went to ASB Kia, Merrut Road and family loved the black GTX+. I wanted Matte for it’s sage green interiors and HUD. The black interiors of GTX+ were not very appealing but gave in to family’s choice. The sales executive said that black will be available in December. I was fine with it and chose 12th December for delivery (my birthday). I asked for X Line and was told that it will take time. I also clearly said that I won’t take any accessories and would do my own insurance. The sales executive was fine with it. On 26th November, I went to the showroom for booking. As soon as I paid the booking amount, the executive asked “Sir, please arrange the payment and also tell me the delivery date”. I was like, how can I tell the delivery date? Here comes the shocker: Sir, car is in yard. Please arrange payment as we need to close the billing by 30th November. I was shocked and irritated. Why I wasn’t told that the car is already with them. Why the fuss of waiting? I went home anguished. I was ok since the car was available. The older car was sold so I needed one. Final nail in the coffin: While going through this forum, I learned that Kia has removed the All Door Power Window Auto Up/Down with Safety feature from GTX+ and is now exclusive to X Line. I called up the SA and asked the same to confirm. To my surprise: Sir, don’t worry, your car will have this feature. We don’t have this update yet. I gave him an earful and asked to immediately cancel the delivery. I updated the same on the whatsapp group that was created after the booking. I immediately got a call from his TL and manger. I simply said, I cannot continue the deal as it was built upon lies and false information. On 27th, I went to another showroom in East Delhi, I was told that I could get an X Line in 5 days but I will have to opt for Insurance and accessories from them. I was not ready and so was told: sir, kisi ki gadi kaat ke denge. Aap itna to kar sakte ho. I went out of showroom, without saying a word. I was on this forum and learned about Jayanti Kia. I called them up and was soon connected to Akash from sales team. I was told that he is getting 2 X Line today evening (27th November). I petrol and 1 diesel. He said that he can hold 1 for me but I need to pay the booking amount by evening. I made certain things clear: I will opt for my own insurance. I will choose accessories which I want. He was fine but the condition was that the billing has to happen on 30th November. I was fine with it since I was willing to take the delivery on 1st December. On the same day, I was asked to provide the documents for loan. On the same day, verification was done at home and office. Kudos to SBI 😊. Same evening, I got a call from the bank to come next day to sign the loan papers. I went to the bank and completed the formalities. I asked them to hold the release until I give them the go ahead. I went to the showroom and met Akash. One of the best sales person I met. I was given complete overview of the car so as to minimize the time spent on the delivery day. I booked Zekardo for PDI on 30th. I completed my payment part on 30th and authorized the bank to release the payment post PDI. Got a 10 from Zekardo. I wasn’t available during the PDI so the tech was continuously sending updates, videos and photos. Later in the evening, I sent the list of the accessories that I wanted. Sharing the list of the same. Accessory Cost Side Step 23,759 Premium Dual Layer Mat 7599 Body Cover 2625 Side Garnish 1073 bumper corner protector 789 Door Edge guard 377 Total 36,222 I asked him to fit the accessories ONLY if I could get them for 30k. He discussed and agreed 😊. I opted for My Convenience package as it looked good. During the delivery on 1st December, I paid the MCP and accessories cost and took the delivery. Overall, a very good experience with Jayanti Kia. Will not recommend ASB (Merrut Road / Sahibabad). I opted for Acko Insurance. I paid 32K for the insurance with 19.29L IDV.

1181, Kxar07 , 16:33 ,Newbie,"Happy to be part of the Automotive family! My first post. I am buying my first car and after considering Elevate, Grand Vitara, and VW twins, I finally booked Kia Seltos GTX+ in the end of September. Family was happy with it because of refinements and comfort it provided. After being driven most of my work-life, I wanted to take the wheel. So. Booked GTX+ at Jayanti Kia, Delhi. Had a couple of drives. Short ones, but sufficient to differentiate between the contending cars. The booking and follow-through were very encouraging and meanwhile I cleared all the paperwork. The delivery was finalized in the last week of November. It was through this forum that I learned about Zecardo, and I thank all my stars that I did. Two days before the delivery, PDI was scheduled and I went to the dealership. The car was stunning, being washed and readied. The PDI, however, was less so. It was found that the dashboard had been tempered with in a way so that the Odometer reading was 20 KM, while the OBD reading was 285 KM. Zecardo money, well spent! Ups and downs and a lot of heartache later, I let go off that particular car. Came back to the forum and read a thread that advised not to let go of the selected car because of dealership experience.

1182, smoes , 07:49 ,BHPian,"Hey folks, I have a GTX+ Turbo Petrol. When I move the gear lever to the right from D , S mode gets activated. If I understand correctly, this mode is a quick way to switch to sport mode instead of moving the dial to go between Eco/Normal/Sport. Now, when I'm in this mode and I manually switch gears (either using the gear lever Up/Down or by using the paddle shifters) the mode immediately switches to Normal and the regular manual gear indicators (1/2/3...) is shown instead of (S1/S2...). I remember this was not the case earlier (a week or so back) and moving the gear lever to the right and shifting gears manually and the car remained in sport mode. This used to be a lot of fun to drive and suddenly this is no longer working. I remember seeing an error/message (something about D mode...) when I was on the highway and had moved the gear lever to the right, but I was focused on the road and didn't notice what the error was. So a couple of questions: 1. Can you folks confirm that switching to S mode by moving the gear lever to the right and then manually switching gears retains the car in the S mode? 2. If #1 is true then I'm facing an issue; has anyone faced a similar issue in the past and know how to fix this? Btw, When I'm on S mode, the automatic gear switches don't change the drive mode.

I have used this manual gear feature couple of times and I have never seen S1, S2 etc. being displayed over the MID. It always showed 1, 2 for the gear. I was told that while the car behaves similar to what it would in the S mode, technically it is not the S mode because you have to manually upshift the gears (unlike in S mode where it automatically up shifts), while on braking the downshift happens automatically. But as I said, I have used this feature only couple of times, so my experience is limited.

I am torn between Carens Luxury + DCT, Seltos HTX+ DCT and GT Line variant, and had been little sceptical as to how ADAS will perform in our conditions. My queries- 1) How good is the adaptive cruise control. With ADAS I heard, it's either Adaptive cruise control or no cruise control. How well is it calibrated to our highway conditions? If it isn't well calibrated am I good using the normal cruise control with HTX+ DCT? 2) Your review of other ADAS functions? If they are merely gimmicks, can we individually turn off each of them? Also once turned off, do they stay OFF or we need to turn OFF each time we start the car? 3) I am considering the GT Line only for following add ons- EPB, Auto Hold, 360 degree camera, blind view monitor and rain sensing wipers. If the ADAS isn't worth it, I am even thinking of going for a Carens Luxury + (captain seat version, we are family of 4).

I would save a cool 1.5L over the Seltos. Over a month and 1000+ KMs of driving GTX+, here is my take. 1. ACC is very useful while driving on highways or even within a city if you have wide roads (e.g. Noida/Delhi). While on highways, you may want to keep it on for longer stretches, on city roads, it helps to give rest to your legs in short intervals. ACC has an option of choosing the distance of 3, 4 or 5 car lengths and depending on the chosen option it slows down the car if it spots a vehicle ahead. Now while on one hand we can be happy for the safety aspect, but some times it is irritating (given that we are accustomed to slightly lesser distances) that if the vehicle ahead moves even slightly in your lane, the ACC will apply breaks. 2. Some ADAS features are impractical, some are extremely useful and some are like 50-50, depends on user. My thoughts based on experience. A) FCW & FCAA: If it was just a warning, it was fine, but since it applies emergency brake, it is highly impractical in our road conditions. It may in fact lead to a rear collision. I switched it off after a near miss on Day 1 itself. B) LDW, LKA, LFA: Useful on highway and wide city roads (during less traffic). Not so much on city roads with moderate to high traffic. But it really depends on the user. C) LVDA & HBA, RSW: Gimmick D) DAW, SEW, BSCW, BSCAA, RCTW, RCTCAA, 360 Camera: Extremely useful in daily drives. 3) Auto-Hold, Electronic Start-Stop: Absolutely godsend. FCW: Front Collision Avoidance FCAA: Front Collision Avoidance Assist LDW: Lane Departure Warning LKA: Lane Keep Assist LFA: Lane Following Assist LVDA: Leading Vehicle Departure Alert HBA: High Beam Assist RSW: Rain Sensing Wipers DAW: Driver Attention Warning SEW: Safe Exit Warning BSCW: Blind Spot Collision Warning BSCAA: Blind Spot Collision Avoidance Assist RCTW: Rear Cross Traffic Warning RCTCAA: Rear Cross Traffic Collision Avoidance Assist", 5th December 2023,kia-seltos,Ghaziabad,83,325,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

Tell him, you will release payment immediately after PDI and PDI is a must, these are tactics used by the SAs to ensure they receive the full amount at the earliest, s they can be assured of the sale even if during PDI, you find something faulty. I insisted on PDI before full payment, but there was nothing wrong during PDI, so I paid the full amount within a couple of hours of PDI and got the car the next day. However, my cousin wasn't so lucky as he paid the full amount before PDI on the insistence of the SA, and on PDI, the car had some issues including scratches and the like, the manufacturing date was also more than a couple of months old, so he was sure there was something wrong, it had been rejected by a couple of other customers as well, He asked for another car and didn't go ahead with it and had to wait another month for the next set of cars to arrive, before he could get his. So, be careful and don't pay the complete amount before PDI, but give your word that you will transfer the amount immediately after the PDI, if they have nothing to hide, they will accept your proposal and allow you PDI before payment.", 10th December 2023,kia-seltos,Muscat,712,"2,212",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

But, should I go for R17 for better ride quality as suggested by many users, as you went for R18. And about Headlights. Will upgrading them void my warranty? If you go for R17 you will have to downsize your rims too. Other option is that you could ask the showroom to ask any other customer who is buying a lower variant HTX and exchange the tyres and rims with them. Many people would be happy to have bigger rims on their cars due to the fad value. In my case I just went with better tyres in the same stock size and comfort has improved a lot. Also when you get the delivery the tyres are really pumped up overpressure (mine were at 44 psi). When you drop the pressure to 32-33 the ride quality is decent. The JK tyres are just noisy and have a lot of rolling noise. So I went with Continentals. However please note that Conti UC6 have a UTQG rating of 340 A A while the JKs have a UTQG of 400 A A (this basically means the Contis should last 35-40k kms while the JKs would last around 50k kms as Contis are softer while JKs are harder. But Contis give better grip and better ride and less noise. On the headlight upgrade it is a difficult and expensive option (though I had it done on my Hector) so far only Fe retrofit has a solution called octo q which costs 65k. It would also void the warranty though. What I am more interested in is replacing the Ice Cube Foglights with a 2 inch or 3 inch projector fog light as a plug and play solution, but for that to be possible, a plastic fog lamp bezel is required, which is currently not available for the GTX and Xline versions.

1249, Mr Anderson , 07:51 ,BHPian," ADAS experience after 3 months I have been driving my Seltos X-line diesel 6AT for 3 months now and one thing I've realized that is truly a boon is the ADAS feature, especially the Front Collision Avoidence Assist system (FCAA). Seeing videos of ADAS level 2 on youtube got me really excited and it was one of the main features that made me buy the Kia seltos face-lift version. But the excitement didn't last long after driving as I was not getting the hang of it initially. The warning beeps and the car applying breaks automatically even though the vehicle ahead of me seemed a fair distance away made me turn off the ADAS features, which I later realized wasn't the fault of ADAS but bad driving practice on my part. After keeping ADAS turned off for 15-20 days, I gave it a go once again and I turned it on again and tried to drive carefully so as to not trigger any warning beeps or automatic brakes. This practice made me start to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead and avoid cutting them for overtakes which I had normally done for years. I realised FCAA didn't kick in when your car is just crawling in heavy traffic which is when you are moving too slowly, only the parking sensors beeped in that case. It automaticlly defines a safe distance to apply automatic brakes based on the speed of the car which is amazing. If the car is too fast as in when you drive on highways, FCAA will kick in pretty soon, but if you're stuck in traffic FCAA won't kick in unless you're almost about to bump the vehicle infront of you. So, once you get the hang of it, driving with ADAS on, in city traffic is not as troublesome as some might think. The final realization about it's benefits came when once I had a pretty rough day work. I was driving back home still thinking about all that went wrong that day and not paying much attention to what was on road and suddenly breaks were applied automatically after the vehicle infront for me had stopped abruptly. No damage was done. If not for ADAS that would have 100% been my first road accident in my new car. All in all, my driving practices have been altered so much (for the better)in these 3 months that I now no longer get any beeps and warnings from the cars ADAS system without any conscious effort on my part. It's become a habbit now. PS: I do keep the Lane Keep Assist and Lane Following Assist off in city traffic and turn them on alongwith dynamic cruise control only on highways.", 15th December 2023,kia-seltos,Raipur,104,249,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

Is that not the case? You can, but it makes no sense to be honest. You need an initial speed of atleast 40kmph to activate it in the first place which is not possible every time within in city traffic. You are also bound to press breaks more often in city traffic out of instinct even if you know adaptive cruise control could do that for you. And once you press the breaks, cruise control gets switched off. Also unlike FCAA which, in city traffic, allows you to get much closer to the vehicle ahead of you before kicking in, adaptive cruise control will kick in from a fair distance away and reduce your speed even if set at the lowest possible value. It makes no sense to maintain that much distance in sluggish city traffic.

I believed it gets this, which effectively should work in even stop and go traffic. Yes it does, but again you need an initial speed of 40kmph to activate it after which the stop and go feature will work flawlessly and your adaptive cruise control can make your car go all the way down to zero speed without you needing to press breaks. But you have to reach 40kmph atleast once to engage it. If you are in a sluggish traffic, how are you going to satisfy the initial condition to even activate it in the first place? And if you press the breaks even once(out of instinct)the cruise control will get disengaged. So, now you will again have to reach a speed of 40 kmph in traffic and activate it again. Also, even though it will work perfectly in stop go traffic(assuming you never press the break instinctively), dynamic cruise control will make your car slow down and stop if needed, when their is still a fairly large distance between your car and the vehicle ahead of you, even when you set it to the lowest possible distance between vehicles, which is not feasible in sluggish traffic. Some two wheeler or even a four wheeler can cut you off and get in the middle of your way. There will be more than enough space for them to come in between your car and the vehicle infront of you and most of them will do it which is annoying to be honest.

Hope everything goes well during delivery. Do share some pics when you can. Definitely not a noob question for first time users of automatic cars. Even I was in the same space so I can relate. You may or may not engage EPB as the car will not inch forward even if EPB is not engaged.

1287, jazzy , 12:16 ,BHPian," Quote: When on Auto Hold, it won't turn off the engine. In fact, the usual Auto stop/start gets disabled when you activate Auto Hold. I don't think that's true either. Auto stop/start works along with Auto Hold. There is an icon for Auto stop/start on the MID, it gets turned to green and gray when it is engaged/disengaged. I have seen it turn on and off when on Auto Hold. Also engine starts and stops and the noise can be heard. Basically, Auto stop gets engaged when you are in Auto hold for a few seconds, that's my understanding. I need to check whether EPB gets auto-engaged when car is in P mode and engine turned off. Good thing if it works, as it's possible we forget to do it sometime. Also, on the ongoing discussion, there is absolutely no advantage of putting the car in P when you are not parking. Modern DSGs are made to automatically manage the clutch engagement/disengagement without getting heated when car is not in motion (case in point, waiting at traffic signal for a few minutes). And there is no use of putting it in N, unless you need to get your car towed. Another problem with putting it in N is that you need to remember to manually apply brakes too otherwise the car will move if on a slope.", 21st December 2023,kia-seltos,Bengaluru,68,143,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

Is it safe to engage driving in other modes (eco, sports, manual) or should I stick to normal mode for now ? I think it's okay, but the sports mode may take the RPM above 4000 at times.

Quote: 4) Is it recommended to not cross 2K rpm, or should I cross it sometimes? Which is better for breaking in a brand new engine ? Variable speed is what you need to properly break-in. Here's the complete break-in instructions from the owner's manual: Quote: Vehicle break-in process By following a few simple precautions for the first 1,000 km (600 miles) you may add to the performance, economy and life of your vehicle. Do not race the engine. Whilst driving, keep your engine speed (rpm, or revolutions per minute) between 2,000 rpm and 4,000 rpm. Do not maintain a single speed for long periods of time, either fast or slow. Varying engine speed is needed to properly break-in the engine. Avoid hard stops, except in emergencies, to allow the brakes to seat properly. Don't tow a trailer during the first 2,000 km (1,200 miles) of operation. Fuel economy and engine performance may vary depending on vehicle break-in process and stabilize after 6,000 km (4,000 miles). New engines may consume more oil during the vehicle break-in period. Additionally, the tyres are also new and need a break-in. It's recommended to go light for the first 500 kms. A detailed article here. Wishing you many safe miles ahead. Have a wonderful trip!

ADAS features once turned off remain turned off for ever. Although I would still suggest to switch on rear cross traffic alerts and blind spot traffic alerts in ADAS. Trust me these are really useful. The Idle Stop and Go switches off the engine at stops which are for more than few seconds. Once the engine is powered off there is no load on the DCT gearbox. Secondly, if you switch on autohold, you don't have to put the car in N or P. It can remain in D till you press the accelerator pedal again. This itself dis-engages the clutch. Rest assured DCTs are good in this Seltos with these two upgrades. Barring couple of days of un-learning of driving gear shift cars, the automatics are much easier and enjoyable to drive. In fact, in city driving conditions, just using the accelerator pedal, one can modulate the speed without using the break pedal too often.", 22nd December 2023,kia-seltos,New,126,163,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

The part where Kia has messed up is by trying to show the view of the cameras on the instrument cluster instead of the infotainment system. I admit it looks eye catchy that the left side of the instrument cluster shows the view from the left camera and the right side shows the view from the right camera, but there is a downside. When you turn the steering left or right to take the turn, the spokes of the steering block the view of the instrument cluster so much so that you have to move your head over or under the spokes to have a clear view of the instrument cluster where the view from the camera is displayed.

But honestly, this is one of those features which is useless most of the times, but sometimes appears to be god sent. I hardly look at the camera view but rely on the rear view mirrors.

1307, 07CR , 11:40 ,Senior - BHPian,"I bought the GT Line DCT Seltos on 20-12-2023. Seltos has replaced my Ecosport S TDCI. I also have a Sonet HTX iMT Turbo P. Would be comparing Seltos with these as well. I recently completed a 600~ KM trip and here are initial impressions- The bad-Headlights are average. With foglamps ON, it is above average, and on highways without the dividers, the oncoming traffic's high beams will blind you. Spread is good, intensity could have been better. Mood lights could also have been linked to drive modes (Like the Carens), currently only the cluster is linked. Front sunshades could have been longer/adjustable, as they leave out some space. Instrument cluster shows navigation directions spectacularly with multiple views for onboard maps. Unfortunately Android Auto's google maps can't be shown here. For a car that is this well loaded, it could have had a cooled glovebox or atleast an illuminated one. Also miss my Ecosport's puddle lamps. Kia could have provided memory seat for driver and electric seat for passenger seat as well ( I know I am asking too much!) The great-The engine has some serious punch. While neither my Ecosport or Sonet are any slouches, Seltos even in Eco mode would easily smoke both. DCT response times are satisfactory for me. I am not generally a pedal to the throttle guy, but won't count myself as an extremely sedate driver as well. Coming from a 17 inch Ecosport, I found the ride quality to be extremely absorbent. My family hates extremely soft suspensions, so this felt extremely mature suspension setup to me(be it city or highway). There is also a markedly improvement compared to the 2019 Seltos I had driven. That said, I would say the Carens still has about 20% better ride quality (City) than the Seltos. Wife liked the recline function of the rear seats. She was happy with the amount of bottles the door bottle holders could gobble up (6-8)! Chiller of an AC. Rear sunblinds and dark sunshade cover of sunroof help even more. Space inside is more than adequate for me. Be it shoulder room, or the legroom. Rear underthigh support could have been bit better for taller (6 ft plus) occupants, but rear occupants in my family are 4'11 and 5'1, so its been great for them. NVH is just spectacular. Start Stop system works seemlessly and the passengers rarely understand when the car switched OFF and turn ON again. Coming to the features, the car is loaded and how! I found the blind spot monitor (instrument cluster display) and adaptive cruise control along with Lane follow assist the best features from ADAS. I have also tried adaptive cruise in city conditions and it works brilliantly. Ventilated seats work silently and the dual zone AC also works as intended. EPB with Auto Hold is another gem of a feature many manufacturers ignore. Few people might think that the car has just gimmicky features, but I beg to differ. There are a few gimmicky one's like the traction modes, sequential indicators, auto high beam assist etc. But the useful features list is just too long. For the power available on tap, the efficiency is spectacular. Mind you the odometer stands at just 675 KMS. My 584 kms Pune-Solapur-Akkalkot-Pune trip yielded me a 14.7 KMPL on the MID. This includes drives through Pune city, highway with lot of slow moving traffic, a 45 min traffic jam (extended weekend and construction work) and what not! On the return stretch which has a slight incline (climbing from plains of Akkalkot to the plateau of Pune), it yielded an even better 15.0 KMPL. I had set the cruise to 89 KMPH (90 is the speed limit), and the car was driven in ECO and normal modes for 95% of the time. Sports was used rest of the time, but considering the extended weekend traffic I found this mode to be an overkill. Time for some pics- Gleaming on the delivery day! Somewhere on the Pune-Solapur highway Blindspot warning is very useful. This warning is available on mirror as well as instrument cluster in the ADAS view. Lane follow assist works extremely accurately even on half marked roads. Relieves a lot of stress on long journeys as the car keeps in centre of the lanes and steers itself. Blindspot view is very useful while changing lanes. Pano sunroof can even be used during daytime. The tinting is very good. However, this was tested in winter season, same needs to be tested in summer. Mileage on the Akkalkot-Pune stretch. Mileage on the complete 584 km trip.

Select Settings>General>Update settings and click update. Update starts in few seconds. It displays you can switch off the car while updates continue. I switched off the car. In the morning I switched on the car again while USB was still plugged in. It said restoring data and rebooted. The installation of updates was complete. It mentioned that the update installed new music files and the maps. Checked the new music files, they worked. Will check the updated maps later.

I drive an X-Line and what i understand is that generally in other cars there are 2 trip meters namely Trip A & Trip B which we can reset accordingly as per our needs. What KIA has done is instead of simply naming A & B, they have named one as 'accumulated trip info' and it can be resetted too from MID buttons on steering wheel. And they have named second trip meter as 'since refuelling' and added functionality of auto reset after refuelling(min 6 ltrs of fuel for auto reset), this can be also be made to manually reset as per your needs instead of auto reset after every fuel stop and for that configuration can be done from settings in the main touchscreen unit. Additionally they have given a third trip meter named 'drive info' which gets reset every time we restart the car manually. All the three trips show 1) the distance covered 2) the time taken and 3) the fuel efficiency. Hope i'm able to explain my understanding of the system correctly.

Your understanding matches the infotainment system manual (and mine too), so I have a GTX+, and the behaviour I'm seeing is that despite configuring the 'Since Refueling' option to manual reset via the infotainment cluster settings, it still 'automatically resets' after refueling (or in my case rather randomly, since I have to park on slight incline and the system sometimes gets confused with the changes in fuel level due to fuel sloshing).

This link shows the tyre type: https://tyresnmore.com/all-continent...BoCBpAQAvD_BwE I would 100% recommend the change from day 1 as the noise level of the JK tyres is high and Contis are at least 30% less noisy. The ride comfort is also better with the Contis. Also be sure to change the tyres within the first 100kms , then only you will get the best exchange value for the current tyres.

How is the service in Chennai. Do they delay deliveries despite taking them early? 2. Now that the facelift has the DEF + SCR combo. Has anyone faced any DPF issues. If yes does the cluster based regen work ? How long does the DEF last ? 3. The brochure from the dealership states that wireless Android Auto and Apple Carplay is available on the GTX+ trim. Some reviews here state they are only on the lower ends. Are they available on the GTX+? 4. Being a techie and leading teams developing cockpit & aras (advanced rider assits systems) in motorcycles.

For lower versions it is available though. The headlights are very average and there are way less reports of this than I expected. My old car also had a full-LED headlamp but the throw and intensity were exceptionally good.

Was quoted ₹58000 for the upgrade. Since they will have to open up the headlights to do the upgrade, it will definitely void the warranty.

I enquired locally and was able to find the outgoing models LED headlights for around ₹9500 for a used pair and planned to get the Octo Q setup on these.

1433, 07CR , 12:26 ,Senior - BHPian,"2000 km update on my GT Line DCT So I have completed 2000 km in my GT Line DCT which includes a mix of driving in dense city traffic to cruising at 120 Kph on Samruddhi Mahamarg. Few observations- 1) If possible do stretch for the ADAS equipped variants of Seltos. They have got it brilliantly calibrated for Indian conditions. I have rarely used Emergency braking feature, but other than this Adaptive cruise control, Lane keep assist, Lane follow assist work excellently at highway speeds. Infact you can even use adaptive cruise control in even city conditions. All these make long journeys extremely tireless. 2) Auto hold is a godsend. Mental note to myself- All my future cars MUST HAVE this feature! 3) Headlights are average at best. Can't believe my Sonet's headlight setup is better than my Seltos (a car that costs nearly twice it!) 4) DCTs shifts are extremely seamless. I was in a dilemma whether to go for a iMT or a DCT (after a brilliant experience in my Sonet iMT), but glad we went for the DCT. I hope with Auto hold, ISG and relatively good traffic conditions, my DCT won't give any issues. 5) DCT upshifts at around 1.7-1.8 K RPM in eco mode. In normal mode it stretches till 2.1-2.2 RPM. 6) Power is more than adequate even in Eco mode. If you press the pedal to the metal, the gearbox isn't lethargic and responds quickly even in Eco mode. 7) Engine spins at an extremely relaxed 1.3-1.4K RPM in 7th gear at around 77 KPH. This just right at the beginning of turbo zone, extremely relaxed and refined. At 120 it is at 2.1 K RPM while 100 KPH comes up at 1.8 K RPM. Extremely good rpms for cruising yet maintaining good fuel economy. 8) Extremely good fuel economy considering the power available on tap. I have not driven with a goal of achieving in great numbers, and these are under normal driving conditions including city runs, wifey's learning to drive Seltos phase, cruising at a 95 kph crowded and traffic jammed pune solapur drive, cruising at 120 on Samruddhi etc. See attached fuel logs for numbers. 9) There is serious power available. On Samruddhi while cruising at 120, I wanted to see the engine's power on a open yet safe patch. I tried it and it reached some unmentionable speeds in a giffy. PS- Please try these only in places by taking extreme precaution. Somewhere on the way to Shegaon. At Shegaon, Anand Vihar, chilling with it's competitor! 120 KPH in 7th gear will result in a very relaxed 2.1 K RPM. 77 Kph at 1.3 K RPM in 7th gear is VERY VERY relaxed and refined.

1442, krishnan76 , 21:42 ,Newbie,"Hello Folks, Generally, I am an avid reader of TBHP threads but rarely post. But to deviate, I thought it is time to post as we got home the GTX+ 1.5 Turbo Petrol a couple of weeks back after extensive test drives of all competitors in the segment. Here's why we fixed Seltos (Pewter Olive) as our second car to complement the existing BMW X3. Need: A second car for more common city/highway use as wifey wanted a more daily-use kind four-wheeler. The go-to car kind, you know. Test drives: Grand Vitara/Hyryder: Nice Hybrid cars. Good for city drives but we felt they were a bit underpowered for highway use. The interiors too were not really up to our expectations. Omitted. Hyundai Creta: Never considered as a facelift was around the corner. Honda Elevate: Asked for a Test drive from Dakshin Honda, Mysore Road, for top-end CVT but they never offered a test drive even. So, omitted. Kushaq/Taigun: The 1.5 ltr engine offers brilliant acceleration and driveability. But we felt the AC was a bit underwhelming and as a previous owner of Vento (TDI), we really have not forgotten our troubles. Omitted. Kia Seltos: The PPS Kia in Mysore Road was very welcoming and gave us extensive test drives on a couple of occasions. The SE was very informative and offered some yearend deals to sweeten the whole experience. The features (ADAS and other regular ones) were quite useful and the engine too was very lively. Fixed this as our second car minutes after the first test drive as Home Minister and kids were super happy. DRIVING -- 450 kms so far 1. It is a breeze to drive in the city as the car is quite responsive to all the demands and the 360 camera and blind spot monitoring offer such a blessing. 2. We went out for drive to Mysore last weekend and got a chance to flex its muscles. This is a fast and fun car to drive on open roads, hitting silly speeds even before you know. The DCT/engine combo works well and offer a butter-smooth experience. 3. The SUV is loaded to the teeth with features. Nothing feel like missing. 4. Fuel efficiency: We got around 9-10 kmpl in city and around 13-14 in the Expressway. Quite decent. Using normal petrol, except on one occasion we filled the E20 version from an HP outlet. We did not feel any great difference. 5. Outstanding interior quality, and contrary to many others felt, we are fine with the dark interior theme. 6. The only sore point we felt that is the need to wire for Android Auto.

And he is offering 40k against insurance. But if you are looking for 2023 model only, then you should bargain more as 40k for 2023 is too less. A small story behind my bargaining- I went to Jodhpur Kia in December and was getting 50k discount at that time, then went to Nagaur Kia(a small town near Jodhpur) in January 1st week, told them about Kia Jodhpur quotation, for which, they agreed to give up to 1L discount, then again, visited Kia Jodhpur last week, did the same, for which, finally they agreed to give 1.25L discount. So, I would suggest you to visit 1 or 2 other Kia showrooms near you and do the same. If they have the model and color of your choice, they will surely make you take car from them by luring you with discounts. But don't settle for 40k.

KIA uses Dry-Clutch DCT which, although rare, is prone to overheating in heavy traffic. It all depends on your commute. If you have to travel in heavy traffic regularly, its better to consider other transmissions. IF your travel is during non-peak hours or mostly highway, go ahead with the DCT.

This is persistent in both Normal & Sport modes. Seems like the gearbox takes sometime to downshift , maybe? But than it's defeats the whole purpose of this fast-shifting gearbox.

And he is offering 40k against insurance. But if you are looking for 2023 model only, then you should bargain more as 40k for 2023 is too less. A small story behind my bargaining- I went to Jodhpur Kia in December and was getting 50k discount at that time, then went to Nagaur Kia(a small town near Jodhpur) in January 1st week, told them about Kia Jodhpur quotation, for which, they agreed to give up to 1L discount, then again, visited Kia Jodhpur last week, did the same, for which, finally they agreed to give 1.25L discount. So, I would suggest you to visit 1 or 2 other Kia showrooms near you and do the same. If they have the model and color of your choice, they will surely make you take car from them by luring you with discounts. But don't settle for 40k. Hope this helps!

I had detailed out all a steps a few pages back. Please note that you should NOT di it while driving. You need to start the car and plug in the USB and click update. After this you will need to keep the car started for 10-12 min after which it will give you the message ""the update will continue when the car is switched off"".

Reading through this and other reviews, related to DCT transmission, I am definitely going to opt for an extended warranty.

1519, rayjaycleoful , 00:39 ,BHPian,"After a very long & slow search for a car to replace my 2011 Honda City due to the 15 year rule (I would have kept it forever otherwise) I am looking forward to get a Seltos IVT this week. The car would not be driven more than ~5K a year. (WFH largely and other cars at home) Cars test driven (all AT) over the ~ past two years were 1. Slavia 1.0 (Twice) Lovely car but I suppose 1.5 is the one to get (I realised 3 cylinder vibrations after we got the i20 N line). Unfortunately my usage is so low (4k a year) and planned time horizon is so long that I was unsure about the ease and longevity of a Skoda/ VW Very good dealership experience, both times. The first time I went was when the car had just launched and even though I mentioned I was ""just looking"" they insisted I take a test drive 2. Taigun 1.0 Again 1.0 was not preferred because of refinement and 1.5 is too closely priced to base Hycross, Scorpio-N Z8, etc. 3. Urban Cruiser 4AT (Old Brezza) Not a bad car and extremely VFM but they were out of the top models when I test drove them; this was just before Hyryder introduction 4. Honda City CVT Great car and feels like home but ground clearance is still very low and insulation is very bad. I am also tired of going diagonally on speedbrakers 5. i20 N Line (Bought this to replace a 2014 Gi10) Lovely car which we liked so much we bought it to replace another; this slowed down the search but was worth it because it introduced me to turbo petrols and DCTs. It is IMO the most fun you can have in any car within 18-20L followed by the 1.5 TSI/ 1.5 Turbo Verna 6. Thar Nothing beats feeling you get in this. I will buy one when I have 20L to spare 7. Jimny Had booked one before launch and cancelled when the prices were announced. Test drove for the first time last month when Thunder Edition was announced; somehow didn't connect with it because of the lack of power on road and low space. As much as a capable off-roader it is, my primary usage will always be on the road. The manual one would be really engaging to drive IMO and would love to have one as an extra car for off-roading only someday Cars considered but not driven 1. Scorpio N (really wanted Z4/ Z8 but being asked to wait for 2 years is a little too much) 2. XUV700 (AX7 to expensive and AX5 has a some essential features missing) 3. Honda Elevate (was ready to buy it in a day as a Honda fan boy but was in for a rude shock, explained in an recent post of mine) 4. Grand Vitara Sigma (Extremely VFM for low usage; get stereo from outside and sell whenever because of the insane resale on these cars) 5. Hyundai Verna (too low and quirky) 6. Hyundai Creta (already have 2016 AT) 7. VW Virtus (would have got a GT 1.5 if I had the usage to justify the purchase) 8. Skoda Kushaq 9. Used cars (Not considered because of inflated market, scummy dealers, insurance/ name transfer hassles, etc.) Kia Seltos Was never considered to be honest because of the 3 star safety thing. But after looking at a lot of cars I just wanted to complete the process and this seemed like the most complete package for the intended usage. Funnily, at least 5 of my friends/acquaintances have one at home too. What could have come closest in this choice is the Grand Vitara/ Hyryder Neo drive 6AT but I got to drive the combination in a borrowed car and it felt lethargic - gearbox also jerked a lot and saw the same feedback in some YouTube vids Had even considered it in mid 2023 (it was available with great discounts; pre facelift) but somehow didn't work out then.

Here's what I learnt: You're under NO obligation to pay a penny over the booking amount till the time you see the car in person. Once you pay them the money, they can lead you a merry dance even if they promise a full refund, they'll take their own sweet time to process it. The month-end is coming up so it's highly likely the SA is pushing to close a sale ASAP. The dealership will claim you don't need a PDI, but you do. If nothing else, to ensure the make promised to you is the one that's delivered, and of course to ensure there's nothing off with the vehicle. It's your money and you have a right to inspect the vehicle before paying for it. Add their NEFT details and show it to them, telling them you're willing to transfer the amount on the spot as soon as you're satisfied with the PDI. The part about it being a loss if you refuse the vehicle is utter nonsense. The Seltos is a big seller and if you don't pick it up, chances are someone else will gladly take a vehicle that's available on the spot vs having to wait for 6-7 weeks (their claimed waiting period).

1540, Flasshhhh , 19:01 ,BHPian,"Hello Everyone! I recently got my Kia Seltos GTX Plus DCT in Gravity Grey. I did my booking on 15th January for December 2023 model and hence got a nice discount.(the details of which has been conveyed in previous posts). But overall, it was really a good booking and delivery experience from Kia Jodhpur. Accessories I opted are- Interior and boot mats, Body cover, Tissue box, Window sunshade boot, Screen protector, Lumbar support, Key cover. I don't like chrome much, hence, nothing there. Also opted for Extended warranty. After delivery, took car at Continentals, and got my stock tyres replaced with UC6 ones. Each UC6 tyre costs 11k, but got 16k discount on my stock ones. Overall, paid 28k. Previously, I was thinking whether to have PPF or not. But now, I will have it covered with PPF soon form 3M. One reason being the recent incident which happened just a day after bringing the car home. We covered the car properly with body cover at night. But, the next morning, the front of car cover was torn with bite marks and half of the cover being pulled off by our area's stray dogs. Lucky me, that I had buttoned my cover, or else, we would have found our cover running on streets in morning. I have also ordered a dog repellent spray. Lets see, if it works. Now, about driving- I have done only ~100kms so far and the engine and transmission has been amazing. I have been driving manual all my life, and shifting to DCT has completely changed and brought a lot of comfort to my driving experience. I have so far gotten a city average of 8-9KMPL in Normal mode. The Sports mode is aggressive, but I will stick to Normal mode as it is a nice balance of both, power and economy. As for ADAS features, I have turned most of them off. The Rear Collision system has to be switched off every time the car restarts. I will test them on highways. Till now, I loved- 1. Auto-hold and ISG. The best technology in recent times. Its definitely worth having in a car. 2. DCT and turbo petrol engine. Its refined as hell. Previously, I used to drive a Tata car, hence, the difference felt was 3. The way instrument cluster and entertainment system has been united and fitted gives a premium feel to it. There is no lag in display and camera quality is very good. Bose speakers personally for me are good enough. 4. ADAS features, although will be used rarely by me, are accurate and brilliantly calibrated. Apart from these, the panoramic sunroof, Black interiors, physical button controls, ventilated seats gives nice feeling. Overall, the love for the car has only increased after buying. Will share the experiences and journeys with you all in coming time.

Before you get the PPF done, suggest you go through this thread- the real world experiences are too varied Thank you! And yup, real world experience do varies, mostly due to 2 reasons. One most important being the type of PPF. Older PPFs like PVC ones had major drawbacks, like cracking and paint peeling. But the latest TPU one is much advanced, although not perfect. Second point is detailers using PVC/TPH PPF(older ones) at price of the advanced TPU-PPF, as it is hard to differentiate between them. So, its recommended to have PPF from branded, known ones. Also, not parking in sun or using body cover helps against these long term issues. One thing which will not happen everywhere, but sometimes do happen in 2-tier cities/towns. Some not so good people deliberately scratch the newly seen cars which are parked at not so secured places. One of my friends bought latest Verna last year in black. It instantly becomes highlight wherever parked. He used to park in front of a trust run hospital where he works. Within a week, there were scratches. Same scene happened with my cousin. Overall, we have to see the risk-reward ratio, which varies individual to individual. Also, my cousin kind of knows Jodhpur 3M store owner. So, I would discuss everything with him transparently. That being said, there are drawbacks which I will keep in mind and if I opt against PPF, will surely convey here with reason.", 25th January 2024,kia-seltos,Jodhpur,63,74,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

It is advisable to skip the dashcam as a part of the dealer accessory since majority of them are of average quality and command a steep premium. Best is to pick the ones recommended / best sellers from Amazon for ex. 70mai , DDPAI. The installation too is pretty easy and doesnt take more than 20-25 mins for the job. Even routing the rear camera isnt that tough. I too was apprehensive of this before , but after installating 2 dashcams (70mai A500 & M300) I can affirm that its a simple DIY job. P. S.: In todays day and age , given how unsafe our roads have become a good dashcam has become a must-have accessory. Its an investment I would say.

Next the ISG kicks in and shuts the engine off. For resuming, we just tap the accelerator so that engine starts and then the auto hold is released. But in practicality - while driving, assume both the functions are engaged - when you stop at a signal and press the brake pedal just enough to engage both, will we get enough time to take the foot off the brake pedal without starting the engine? Or is it that both the ISG and Auto Hold functions contradict each other and we end up with our foot on the pedal so as to not start the engine inadvertently, All I want to know is if the tuning is done in such a way that there will be reasonable reaction time given to the driver so as to take advantage of both the functions.

Stable drive at high speed and responsive all around. The turbo kicks in when overtaking and it is a blast. I faced some rough patches on state highways and the car just pulled through perfectly. Didn't feel the need for an AWD even on a few sketchy roads. No fatigue at all due to excellent suspension and very low NVH. I feel it was a good judgment to go for Continental UC6. Thanks Team BHP for the inputs. Road experience: The NE4 is amazing. We did have fog on the road going to Jaipur but the drive was made comfortable due to road quality. Smoot tarmac and good options all through for a short break or a longer one. Toll pass-through experience was smooth throughout as well. The returning side of NE4 from Jaipur to Delhi has more undulations than the other side. More options for taking breaks and fuel pumps. Trip and stay were marvelous, by the way! But half of Delhi was out driving on roads it seemed. Note to self: Over long weekends, check-out from hotels earlier to avoid mobs at rest points.", 29th January 2024,kia-seltos,Delhi,12,15,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

Tyres have marking indicating ""Outside"" or an arrow pointing to the rotation of the tyre. Tyres are designed to rotate one way- the grooves which are designed for grip, water repulsion and efficiency work only one way, when rotated the other way, they may not perform up to specifications causing low grip and low water dispersion.

1620, neoone042 , 10:43 ,Newbie,"I just did another (my 3rd on this vehicle) Bangalore-Kochi trip in my GTX+ 2023. I went with my wife and returned alone. I have done almost ~4300 km in the last three months of owning this beast. A few observations: 1. Engine and Transmission: The turbo petrol engine is quite refined. My benchmark was Skoda Kushaq before this, but this is as good, if not better, in terms of responsiveness. 2. NVH: The NVH levels are not exceptional. I would rate it a 3.5 out of 5. I've been told that the tyres make a lot of difference and that I can add an additional layer of sound insulation which will make the inside cabin more peaceful. I am currently not feeling the urge to invest here as they are tolerable for me. 3. Driving Modes: Most of my driving has been in normal mode, which I think is the sane thing to do. It gives the right amount of power at your disposal for faster overtakes and can work when you are driving at constant speed, too. Sports mode is just too exciting, and Eco is just too dull for my liking. 4. ADAS: Lane drive assist with adaptive cruise ensures you can relax when the road is empty while the vehicle is munching miles. In the city, I don't think these features are of any use, but on highways, they are a lifesaver. Even after 4-5 hours of continuous driving, you don't feel tired or in need of taking a break. Also, lane keep assist forces me to use turn indicators while changing lanes, without which switching lanes is a task because of how heavy the steering wheel becomes. Another very useful feature is the high beam assist when driving at night - takes the pressure off when driving on those low-lit roads. A lot of people keep saying that ADAS in India is a gimmick right now. Based on my experience, I don't think that is true. While it is not very useful in the city, I think it adds real value when driving on highways. 5. Auto Hold and ISG: Auto hold has been the saving grace in peak Bangalore traffic. It takes the pressure off driving and makes the trudging tolerable. ISG helps keep the engine cool in standstill traffic. 6. Android Auto/Carplay: I don't think I miss the wireless connectivity as much and have become quite used to getting in the car and plugging my phone in. I can imagine wireless AA/Carplay will be quite seamless, but I don't think it would make a big difference in my life. 7. Mileage: I was actually dreading the mileage figures based on my research online, but I'm pleasantly surprised at what the car is delivering right now. I drive with a light foot which gives me about 11-12 kmpl in Bangalore traffic, almost the same as what my humble Tata Zest was giving me before this. On the highways, I get anywhere between 14-17 depending on how I am driving. In one of the situations, when I was maintaining a speed of 80-90 for a long stretch (100-120 kms) the car showed an astounding 18.5kmpl average on the dash. Will have to do a tank-to-tank measurement to see if this is actually accurate. 8. Dashcam: To keep it short, I got one installed (Vantrue S1 Pro). It has given me peace of mind and allowed me to record beautiful stretches without taking my phone out. On another note, I don't understand why, with such a sophisticated camera setup, Kia could not have a built-in dashcam functionality in the car software. 9. Ride comfort: I drove the HTX model too recently, and I have to say that the 17-inch tyres make a difference in terms of comfort. While it is not a lot, the next time when I switch tyres, I will probably go for the 17-inch ones. Apart from that, driving inside the Seltos has been a pleasure. I don't think the dark interiors make it claustrophobic(personal opinion), but that could also be because I and my wife both are relatively small people (5'6"" and 5'1""). 10. Cornering: Considering the SUV stance, at low speeds of 40-50 kmph you don't really feel the body roll at all. However, at 80+ speeds, you can feel it. At 120+ speeds, it is quite evident. The vehicle feels very stable, though, at all times - no complaints there. 11. Headlights: I think the throw and intensity should have been better. They are quite average. Not going to change anything right now, although I may think about upgrading in the future. It has been an absolute pleasure driving around in this. These 3 months have only added to the love I have for this car. ", 1st February 2024,kia-seltos,Bengaluru,9,36,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Also would like to believe in Kia not making such a huge blunder in the factory itself. In other news, I am really enjoying the car after a not-so-great few days right before delivery; similar to others here, for some reason the dealer kept saying ""Your car is coming tomorrow"" for a week, ""Please pay some more token money"", ""Our insurance is best and you must take it"", etc, etc. but in the end I was just happy to have things done my way get the car. I got it within a month and came to realise that this is probably the cost of getting a car which is so popular that people are ready to buy it instantly with accessories and inflated insurance. The car is a HTX IVT in black. I would have loved to get the turbo but the car it replaced did only ~4000km in the past year and thus 3-4 lakhs more did not make sense. The IVT is really smooth and technology aside, very similar to drive as our old 2016 Creta TQ Petrol AT. I have extensively driven a manual Honda City, manual 1.2 Gi10, and 1.0 DCT i20 N line and I used to fly those cars in comparison . IVT while adequate, smooth, and reliable is not an enthusiast's choice - but I knew this and I'm fine with it. And may I say it is still better to drive than the Honda City/ Elevate CVT. First thing I noticed that the headlights are really poor, I wonder if it's just me but going by so many posts, probably not. The car is also to new for me to do anything aftermarket right now.

He is saying that this is the only 2024 model he has with him now, for obvious reasons.

Yes, peace of mind is important when you are paying more than 20L for something. Congratulations for finalizing your Seltos! In India, using galvanised steel(Zinc-Iron alloy) is not mandatory. Zinc is used to protect steel from corrosion. So, there is a chance of under-body corrosion, especially in places of regular rains. Also, with time the coating wears off, so it is said to repeat the coating every year. So, in my opinion, you should have it. Other than that, if he advices a teflon/wax coating, don't have it. And it is a nice decision to go for ceramic. Have it as soon as possible.(Mine is still pending). Apart from that, before delivery, visit Continentals, check UC6 tyres, finalize the price with discount. I got 16k discount in total for my JK tyres. My SA told that I can have My Convenience package within 2 months of my delivery on same price. But, you should confirm it with your dealer once.

From what I found online, Seltos X-Line DCT petrol costs approximately 25.90L On-road including Accessories and Extended warranty in Bangalore.

If you are planning to pay extra for My convenience plus, then they can't reject you. The choice is yours. Regarding PDI, whether in showroom or stockyard, don't pay a rupee until you have your PDI successfully completed. Whatever they say, be firm on your decision. And you can and should also check the month of manufacture, there is a way to decode the Month from the Chassis No. Right below your Driver Seat behind the Floor Mat as conveyed by one of Team BHP member. This chassis number will be of 19 digits, rest everywhere it will be 17 digits. The turbo petrol power is linear till 1.8k-2k RPM, crossing that, you will feel the turbo kick in. And yes, there is some noise in cabin at high RPMs(petrol DCT has dual exhaust). Some tyre noise too, as the stock ones are JK tyres.

Thank you Mr. Anderson (I really wanted to say the iconic line of Smith). 1. Would you or other fellow members can tell me if there is actual (read monetary) benefits of having MCP (My Convenience Plus) program. I tried to search online, but could not determine if it yields to actual benefits apart from protecting from YoY price rise in service centre. 2. During the warranty (including MCP or extended) period - Do I need to service the car only from Dealer's workshop or can I go to any authorized dealer workshop for service/periodic maintenance/repairs? Quote: I would suggest you to get it covered with a Paint Protection Film as soon as possible after you buy it so as to protect the original matte finish of the car from rock chips and minor scratches, as they can be highly visible in the matte finish. It is costly but worth the investment. Wish you happy miles ahead. 3. Could you let me know which PPF did you do and how much it costed you? I am looking into various detailers in Bangalore and they are all going in excess of 1.3L easily (Esperto, Carzspa, DetailingBull) with their inhouse PPF brand with 7Y warranty. I checked for XPEL and it is over 2L with 7 years warranty for the matt/satin PPF. 4. Would members recommend tyre changes to UC6 (215/55 R18) or Yoko blue earth (225/55/R18 - They dont make the 215/55/R18 ones) including spare tyre as well. I think all tyres including spare should be off same size or is it not recommended? If yes, which one? In Bangalore both the tyres are costing almost the same Rs. 12800 vs Rs. 13000 per tyre. Exchange value for JK's are mere Rs. 3000 per tyre.

Hello, 215-section tyres are sufficient enough for daily usage with a mix of both city and highway driving, if comparing both UC6 & Blue Earth I'll recommend you to go with UC6.

Have you guys noticed any improvements post upgrade? Couple of things. The volume settings have improved (not the audio quality). Earlier you had to turn up the volume till about 40-45 to hear the song at normal voice level. Now they have recalibrated it to normal level. So now you get the same output at 10-12 level. Yesterday I used the inbuilt navigation for the first time after the update. Apparent improvement is in the layout. Earlier when the nav was turned on and route set, there was one bottom layer of map full screen, and on top of it another layer (direction arrows, left/right etc.) covering 2/3rd screen. If media was also being played, its display (song info/change track etc.) used to get removed. Basically the whole layout was messy. But now, once you set the route on the nav, it neatly occupies 2/3rd of the screen, while in the remaining 1/3rd portion, you can toggle between media display, temp, time etc. Sorry no pics to explain the above, but I hope you get what am trying to say.", 7th February 2024,kia-seltos,Ghaziabad,83,325,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

Anything below 100kms is fine considering it is not 2 months old. Regarding plastic wrappings, someone from them might have remove them, reason best known to them. You can convey it to them, they will place the plastics before delivery. I took delivery of my Seltos on 19th January. When I did PDI, the car was in stockyard and was very dirty which is normal if stays stationary for a month. Overall, going with discounted cars will have its drawbacks. As when a person buy 2-3 months old car on discount, yes, there are chances that the car would have been on a few test drives, would have taken mud, would not look brand new on some aspects, these things will create doubt, but, if there are no major issues related to engine, transmission, air-conditioner etc. in my opinion, one can go for it.", 8th February 2024,kia-seltos,Jodhpur,63,74,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

This is suitable for 2 inch projectors like Aes and GTR. But the catch is that this fitment is irreversible and will most likely void warranty. I am not taking the jump for now and may decide at a later date of required.

Different Dealers act in different ways. But, ultimately it depends on how quickly you want your Car delivered. In case the Dealer does not budge and you decide to go to another Dealer, it might take more time.

I had been unable to help take the car for repairs as I had my Viva coming up. Anyway, after the Viva was over, my little brother took the car and had it assessed as to what parts needed replacement. They didn't have the parts in stock so we placed the order and had the car brought back. Since I had to go to Guwahati to submit some documents, I took the car with me - called up the parts manager who confirmed that the parts were in stock. In my hurry to reach Guwahati to ensure that my document verification isn't hindered due to car repairs, I forgot to make an appointment for the same. I call up the number of the service centre that I find on Google and a lady picks up. I explain to her my situation and she seems aghast at the fact that I wanted to get my car repaired that same day itself without prior appointment (note - I called early in the morning as soon as service centre opened). Seeing as it was going nowhere, I asked the number of the body shop manager. After giving me the number, she didn't cut the call but seemed to berate me behind my back. I cut the call as she seemed to ""forget"" to close it from her end No hard feelings from my Side towards the individual. Sometimes not everyone might be empathetic or understanding to our situation. Anyway, I call up the Body shop manager, Mr. Pranab, who immediately understood my situation and assured me that he would get my car fixed and have it delivered by evening. He also got me in touch with a Service Advisor, Mr. Gautam who was also quite helpful. Anyway, by 5:30 pm the car was ready, washed and cleaned inside and out, even engine Bay was sparkling. The car looked great and the front parking sensors, radar, etc. worked without any issue.

I would assume this depends on the negotiation power. Everything is negotiable, but dealerships are unlikely to bend on this. I read someone else was charged 2%. I paid a similar amount and was charged 1.5%. There are various factors that come into play that decide the percentage cost to the dealer including the card network, the agreement between the bank and the issuer, between the dealership and the bank, etc. With all this in place, dealerships have a specific percentage cost (MDR) they incur to process CC payments, and they pass that cost on to the customer. It's completely possible that some dealerships try to skim some % off the top, e.g. they incur a 1% MDR but charge you 1.5% for payments through cards, in which case the 0.5 difference in percentage points becomes your negotiation range, but you're unlikely to know what that number is.

Early Service Decision: My odometer read 9614km, but with a planned weekend trip to Tadoba, I opted for the 10,000km service earlier than scheduled. I was still determining the service quality at the first Kia showroom in Nizamabad, but I went ahead. 2. Seamless Check-In: I arrived at 10:30 am, where the service advisor immediately began checking my car. They created a WhatsApp group with the service manager, general manager, service advisor, and technician for transparent communication. When I mentioned that I had the convenience plus package, they said that transferring from another dealership would cost me ₹300 as I bought it at another dealer. The convenience package is at the dealer level. This surprised me, but I told them to go ahead. However, upon transferring, they said surprisedly, ""Sir, no charges."" 3. Unexpected Rodent Issue: The service advisor discovered rat footprints in the engine bay, which was a surprise considering my spacious apartment parking. I requested rodent repellent. 4. Transparent Service Process:The service commenced at 11:00 am, with real-time photos and videos shared in the WhatsApp group. A puncture was identified, and extra charges were communicated. Below is the list of changes in the 10,000km service a)Air Filter b)Engine Oil c)AC Filter d)Top-up of AD Blue, which was at 60%. 5. Service Completion and Additional Offerings: By 1:30 pm, the car was ready, washed, and returned. The dealership attempted to sell underbody and Ceramic coating but was politely rejected. Worthy Points to Share: a) Convenience Plus Package Clarification: AC Filter and Oil Filter are not billable only at 20,000km and 40,000km. b) Let's discuss Elephant in the room: Dashcam Warranty Confirmation! I installed a Viofo A229 Plus (hardwired) dashcam, which I bought from the USA, and it did not void the warranty. c) Scratch Care Program: Contrary to some discussions, the My Convenience package does not include the Scratch Care Program.

Regarding ceramic. I was considering PPF but now will go ahead with ceramic after my 1 month service. PPF although scratch resistant has its disadvantages.

Glad Kia got their service schedule sorted. Earlier it was an utter waste of time and money. The intermittent 5k KMS / 5 Months service was totally irrelevant as it was just a check-up like the 1st / 1 Month service.

However, below factors tilted the favor towards Seltos DCT: - The features Auto Hold, 360 Degree Camera, Ventilated Seats & ADAS [not so much, but good to have]. Creta IVT has a top end with all of these. But, the light and dull interiors did not impress me. Though, some might call it a luxurious roomy interior, but i know managing it will be a pain. - The huge front grill gap in the Creta that got stuck in my head. - Hyundai Dealers quoting waiting periods of 4-6 months for the Creta. - FOMO and YOLO factor for the DCT as recently conducted Polls show DCT Tranny as the most preferred one, followed by D AT and then CVT / IVT. - Dealership experience as well to a small extent, wherein my Kia Dealership experience was a bit better than Hyundai's. Maybe, just maybe, if there was a Seltos top end IVT with all the above features, i might have gone for it. But no point discussing, as that option is not present. I tend to keep my Car for long and it's my sole car. So, am still unsure how the DCT will fare over the longer term. But, fingers crossed. We will see.

Is there any other alternative car offering all the features that a seltos does? 3. Is KIA ASS comparable to hyundai? We have both Creta and Seltos (petrol automatic) in the family so can share some perspective. 1. Rear bench width difference is marginal but we find Creta rear bench more comfortable for 3 passengers. If you already have Creta, not sure if you would get a feel of a bigger car in Seltos. About the suspension, Hyundai keeps it more of softer side which does great job in city and potholes ridden roads. Earlier Seltos used to have quite stiff suspension but now they have made it more compliant so difference may not be significant in terms of ride quality. But do test drive with family so you all can judge the comfort. You are used to Creta and hence the ride quality difference may be more noticeable to you instantly. 2. 20-30 lacs segment is super hot right now but at the lower end, it is very difficult to beat the Korean twins. Not sure if you have considered Alcazar or Carens but they can be other options for you. If you have budget then XUV7OO could be a worthy contender.

Auto hold does not make your car shift to neutral or safeguard your gearbox. Some will tell you it does - please ask them how with supporting facts. I would also be interested to understand it and be happy to be proved wrong. So what all auto hold does is, it holds your car while still in gear and you not having to keep your foot on the brakes. It’s very convenient, but at the same time, it’s not recommended to use auto hold plus D mode for a long duration. It’s like the car is trying to move since it’s in D mode, but the auto hold function keeps applying breaks to make it stop. As a good practice, wait time over 20-30 seconds should make you switch to neutral (with auto hold on/off - doesn’t matter). This has been confirmed by multiple senior technicians at Hyundai. Can’t say about ISG and the DSG gearbox generation though (but do keep in mind that DSG will remain prone to failure regardless of generations).", 14th February 2024,kia-seltos,New,478,"1,587",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

The last know brake pressure is communicated to the ECU and it disengages the clutch so that the gears don't spin along with the engine. Modern transmissions have inputs from ABS Module, Speed Sensors and Brake Switch. So when ABS detects no slip, Speed is zero and Brake Switch is active, the clutch disengages. This is the reason why when ABS sensors fail, EPB and Auto Hold functions are finnicky. Also, when the accelerator is pressed to disengage Auto Hold, a slight jerk is felt.

Introduction: I have been driving for about 15 years now and this is my third car. My first car is a Honda Brio and upgraded to a Polo GT TDI in less than 4 years. Polo had all the points to convince me to upgrade and thoroughly enjoyed the drive for 8 years and had to let go of it during the last year Chennai Floods. [Total loss ] Choice of third car: I was contemplating between Skoda Slavia 1.5 DSG and Seltos DCT GTX+. Had to pick Seltos for all the bells and whistle it brings and ease of maintenance. Run and maintain for a VAG car is generally on the higher side and I wanted to experience how KIA can be and I have mostly heard positive feedback. Also, I thought it will be nice to try a different brand for a change. And hence my decision. So got my self a Black Seltos DCT GTX+ Pros - Looks. It surely does look busy with design, but did impress me. - Engine is butter smooth, especially moving from VAG Diesel. - Love the quality of interiors, definitely looks class above - Sports mode is punchy and is very addictive - Speakers are good, not the best for sure, especially from a brand like Bose, some damping on the doors should help. cons - Paint Quality is OK. VAG cars are just superior in the department from my experience. - Parking Sensors need getting used to, I find them not as accurate. - Ride quality sure was better when i upgraded the JK UX Royale to Continental UC6, but i have been experiencing wheel alignment issue since day1. ""I have had bad experience with UC6 in the past with my Polo GT TDI. since the time i upgraded to UC6 i had wheel alignment issue. How many ever times i fix the wheel alignment, there will still be a left pull on and on replacing the tyres to bridgestone sturdo the issue was instantly fixed."" -Hence, suspecting the same, I decided to replace Continental UC6 on my Seltos to GoodYear efficient grip. BUT, the wheel alignment issue still persisted :( and the ride quality is as bad as JK UX Royale. I am not sure if anyone else experienced similar problem on the 18 Inch wheels. I am yet to get them checked with the service centre. - Last but not least, ADAS. This surely is not for me. I had an incident where the car was approaching a toll plaza stop and just when i was about to stop near a barricade the car engaged ADAS and applied sudden break anticipating obstacle. Well the driver following me did not surely expect the same and rammed my tailgate.

No, what he wants to say is that once you have shifted in ""N"" and engaged EPB. Then further, from ""N"" to ""P"" there is no need to depress the break pedal. You can do it directly.

For Question 1, Yes, The brake should be pressed, at this point since the load is already on the Park Brake, there is no load transfer to the gearbox. For Question 2, This is interesting, My automatics have had a manual hand brake, so this wouldn't happen. May I know when the EPB light is going away? Is it when the break is depressed again in N ? or When the shift to P happens? If the EPB gets automatically disengaged when the brake is pressed in Neutral or while shifting, This method doesn't achieve any gains, it's just better to put it directly into P, I can't imagine why this is implemented this way though considering the drawback,maybe the EPB system has some mechanism to shift the load to first to the EPB, and not onto the gearbox.

I had planned to leave home by 12:30 AM, I wanted to take some rest in the afternoon, however due to some or the other work I could not rest, nor did I get an opportunity later in the evening. I then decided to let go of sleep altogether because if I slept at around 10/11PM, I would not have got up in time (I am a very very sound sleeper). At 12:30 AM, I left my home in GZB and took the DME. As soon as I got on, I don't know what prompted me (surely it was God), and I turned on the ACC and all 3 lane features (LKA, LDW & LFA). I was cruising all along till Akarshardham, when suddenly I felt the strong jerks in the steering and car sway towards left. I was jolted and it didn't take long for me to realise that I had slept off. I think it was only for a very very brief period, less than half a minute I think, because I was still near Akshardham. I turned on the hazard lights and pulled over towards the side. I was in shock and totally numb. I had narrowly missed a disaster. I had fresh water with me, I washed my face thoroughly and decided to go to the breakout point just few meters ahead at the start of Yamuna bridge and have a cup of tea and think over of what just happened. Clearly, lack of sleep had taken its toll. While I was attentive and well prepared mentally that I have to drive and won't get sleep at least for next few hours, my body failed me, even if for few seconds. Those few seconds were enough to cause irreparable damage. The only thing that saved me last night was ADAS!! If I had not turned on the lane assist features, I would have surely crashed into the median and given the speed (exactly 70 KM/Hr) my car was in, it would have been a fatal crash. The other thing I realised is that ACC only works if there is a moving vehicle ahead, it does not work in case the barrier ahead is a stationary object, because my car had not slowed down during the near miss. (more on this in my next post) I thanked my stars, God, and the engineers at KIA for my lucky escape and resumed by journey and drove at speed below 60 throughout. Thankfully the rest of the journey (& the return journey) was uneventful.

You would have gotten 'Check Nearby Traffic' and then AEB would have activated if it thinks there would be a collision. I do not think ACC works as per the lanes marked on the road, if that if what you meant, because it works even on roads where there are no lanes painted. I think the radar fitted in the front ejects rays in a fixed area up ahead. And when a ""moving"" vehicle fouls this area, ACC applies brake and as soon as the area is clear, it accelerates. But the point I am trying to make is that if there is a ""stationary"" object ahead (like a concrete pillar or curving median), ACC does not recognise it as an hazard and does not slow down vehicle. For that one needs to have the FCW & FCA turned on for emergency braking. Disclaimer: What I am claiming above is my observation based on a little test I did last night. By no means I say my observation is 100% correct. Because the ACC setting in my car is to maintain a gap of 3 car lengths and while I took my car pretty close to the concrete median (straight ahead), I am not sure if it was within 3 car lengths or not. But since I was pretty close and car did not slow down, I manually applied brakes.

I think it was only for a very very brief period, less than half a minute I think, because I was still near Akshardham. I turned on the hazard lights and pulled over towards the side. I was in shock and totally numb. I had narrowly missed a disaster. I had fresh water with me, I washed my face thoroughly and decided to go to the breakout point just few meters ahead at the start of Yamuna bridge and have a cup of tea and think over of what just happened. Clearly, lack of sleep had taken its toll. While I was attentive and well prepared mentally that I have to drive and won't get sleep at least for next few hours, my body failed me, even if for few seconds. Those few seconds were enough to cause irreparable damage. The only thing that saved me last night was ADAS!!

In hindsight, these are the things I learnt and without a doubt I will be following them going forward in general and during such situations. - No work is more important that your health and safety. Unless the work itself is related to some medical emergency or health and safety of your folks. It can be easily managed, postponed etc. It is absolutely important that you take adequate rest if you have a late night drive coming up. - DO NOT overestimate your body or underestimate the forces/ways of nature. As someone pointed out, while mentally you may feel agile, active, excited but physically your body may just not cooperate. - Have company. Its always better to have someone with you during late night drives. My wife was willing to come, but I refused thinking it will be unnecessary hassle for her. So if you have an option, use it. - If you have had no opportunity to rest in the day, why drive? It is advisable to hire a driver or use a taxi service. Better to pay nominal amount to dirver/taxi instead of paying huge medical bills/ car repairing / insurance. - Drive in the middle lane. I was in the extreme right lane right next to the median. If lane assist was not activated, I wouldn't even have few seconds to take corrective action (assuming I somehow came back to senses). But if you are in the middle lane, those few extra seconds can be life saving!! - Sing!! even if you are not into music, it may help to put on a good number and sing along. It will keep your senses active and attentive. - If you car has ADAS, use it!!. Why pay for the costly technology and not use it? Yes sometimes it may be PITA, but its better to tolerate the pain sometimes, than be in a position to not feel the pain ever!! -------------------------------- Quote: Originally Posted by Mr Anderson ADAS is totally worth it and a life saver.

I would not completely disagree with you because the fact is that this is my first automatic car and my first with ADAS (including ACC). I have always driven manual cars earlier and have never had such a situation. However, this is not my first late night drive in an ADAS equipped automatic car. The only difference this time was lack of proper sleep/rest.

The car has a pretty long range for detecting other vehicles in the blind spot, especially when merging to a main road. It's not dangerous as you'd think. In fact, pretty useful as I was saved couple of times by it. Please keep it on, always. Quote: 2. Another thing is about ""Forward Collision Warning"". With this feature on, does vehicle only provides visual / audio alerts or applies sudden breaking as well? Both. The sudden braking depends on the speed. Say, you are in slow-moving traffic. Here chances are that car will apply sudden brakes if you get too close or do not slow down enough as per ADAS's expectation. This can come as surprise both for you and other drivers behind you who may end up rear ending you. At high speeds, car will give you audio/visual alerts in advance, giving you enough time to react. Again, if you do not hit brakes or if the deceleration is slower than ADAS's expectation, car will hit brakes. On Saturday night, I was returning home after meeting few friends. It was a dark road with no streetlights. All of sudden, the FCA alerts kicked in and I hit the brakes to reduce the speed, despite not knowing what caused it. As the car moved a little ahead I saw an auto rickshaw that has slowed down for a speed-breaker. That auto was outside the range of my low-beam headlights and had non-functional brake light. Hence, I didn't realise it's presence. I'm not saying that ADAS saved me from an accident, but it surely alerted me well in advance of the unperceived obstacle. Personally, I feel Hyundai/Kia ADAS are very well tuned for Indian conditions.

With this feature on, does vehicle only provides visual / audio alerts or applies sudden breaking as well? I am new to ADAS features having driven this for a month and have concluded that the chances of ADAS features cause harm greatly reduces, although never completely goes away, if the person's driving style is equally calm and sedate. We tend to rush and the me-first attitude makes us do things we could have avoided, it's in this scenario where ADAS can surprise the driver and others behind. The factor here is anticipation and prediction of what the car ahead will be doing by the driver behind you. If the car behind you has seen you make your way through mad traffic quickly and has seen you sucessfully avoid incoming crossing cars etc, it makes for a slightly faster journey and the car behind will tend to do the same thing so that they can pass on faster too. This is a prime scenario for a back collision as the driver behind can never be ready for ADAS reactions as there's no warning, no way for them to see it coming.

1846, ShaanS , 10:23 ,Newbie,"Hello fellow BHPians! It's been around 6 weeks since our purchase of the 2023 Seltos HTX IVT and I've finally been able to find the time to post about the buying experience. My intent is to also pen it down as a review of the HTX IVT variant, as I didn't find too many detailed reviews of the engine / gearbox combo. I also want to keep this active as a long term ownership reviews, but time will tell how successful I am. Before I go in to details, a quick summary of my personal likes, nitpicks and dislikes. I've now covered just over 1000 Kms over ~7 weeks of ownership (~170 Kms Highway (short trip to Mandaragiri off Tumkur Road, via NICE road) and the rest in the city) and have had the 1st service done as well. Sharing my initial impressions of the car. What I liked: The convenience of the automatic especially in Bangalore traffic. The car creeps at a maximum of 7 kmph without any a-pedal input, and only gradually picks up speed till that point. The height adjustable seat and tilt + telescopic adjustable steering combination allowed me to find a good driving position with ease. The steering feels connected to the road, and is quite responsive. It also weighs up nicely at speed. The steering feels nimble in the city, and planted on the highway. I haven't really pushed the car, and driven mostly in eco and normal modes, and will be doing so till the end of the run-in period, but even then I was able to hit triple digit speeds on the highway quite easily. In the normal mode, when revved, the transmission shifts up around 3800 rpm. I get the feeling that while this is mechanically a CVT, there are some pre-defined ratios (especially in eco and sport modes) for specific speeds and revs which kick in, making it behave almost as a TC, in the mid-range. Acceleration on the highway (including kick-down) is a breeze, and overtaking isn't as much of a hassle as one would be led to believe via the reviews (especially when coming from a significantly less powerful car, as in my case.) I actually like that the ride is stiff, as there is lesser body roll as compared to the pre-facelift Creta. It makes navigating potholed roads and bad surfaces a little challenging, but still doesn't make it uncomfortable in the cabin (perhaps because of the 17"" wheels on the HTX) The sun-roof adds another dimension to early morning and late evening drives The stock music system with it's 6 speaker set up packs more than enough of a punch for me, especially after the software update from January. The car is a head turner and I can't help but turn back and admire it once while I exit The creature comforts for passengers (dual zone ac, rear vents, side blinds, rear reclining seats, hand rest, ambient lighting) make the Seltos feel like a significant upgrade from our perspective The front and rear parking sensors and the ability to switch them on in traffic (low speeds) is a godsend! I see more ""premium"" (expensive) cars missing front sensors and with only 3 / 2 sensors on the back, so this is something that sets the Seltos HTX apart The ability to connect one phone via android auto and another via bluetooth is a welcome surprise NVH levels are really good, and barely any engine noise creeps in to the cabin till around 2000 rpm. And even beyond that it's not very loud, or distracting from music, conversation, or traffic sounds. I love the fact that Kia hasn't skimped on insulation under the hood for what is essentially a mid-variant. There is a bit of road noise from the stock Goodyears, but something that I can live with. The AC is quite effective and has easily been able to cool the cabin in the 32 degree bright sunlit days that we've been having in Bangalore recently in a few minutes. Even with the roof blind open (sun-roof closed) and letting in a huge amount of light and heat. The nitpicks: The customizable ambient lighting is a good touch (and makes the car feel a bit more premium), but once you get used to the novelty of it, and discovered your likes, it's not something that you're going to play around with everyday. The printed user manuals, only covered the basics, and you have to use either the web version, or the pdf or the manual app to really go in depth. Even the digital versions are clunky (with the pdf version missing images, having visible borders / guidelines showing that its maybe a pre-final digital copy of the print version). At least for the app or the web versions, they could have made it easier on owners to generate the relevant manuals for people based on variants, and wouldn't be too much of an effort to build so. It's disappointing to go through the manual, and try to find settings on the mid, which don't exist for your variant. Turn by Turn navigation on the mid isn't integrated with android auto, which I think is a software gap, and not limited by the hardware, so would have been a good touch. Auto engine cut off is a little intrusive in traffic, but quite easy to disable. Auto headlamps switch on too early, even with a slight cloud cover, or going below any of the many under construction metro stations in Bangalore. The glovebox is smaller than our Celerio, but space in the cabin is decent, with all 4 doors having good space for water bottles and knick-knacks. The space under the front hand-rest / air purifier is quite usable too. What's strange to me is that the front cup holders are of different sizes. Piano black finishes on the interior surfaces, especially on high touch areas (e.g the phone cubby) will not age well. Wired android auto! There is a bit of the rubber-band effect especially with lower revs, but it's manageable with throttle input, and is turning me in to a more sedate driver. I hate that Kia deleted the one touch window up down function on all windows (for a couple of months) and I only have it for the driver. It's only a nitpick because I was aware of this deletion, when making the purchase decision. The pewter olive shade is a looker, but a dust magnet! The dislikes: It may be my driving position, and I'm yet to experiment, but the windshield is super reflective, during most of the day. The headlamps throw is a little narrow to my liking, and I've remedied this for now by adjusting the beam height a little bit (to the 2 position on the adjuster dial) and switching on the fog lamps once in a while, on especially dark stretches. I'm not in favour of any changes to the stock set up, but if it gets really bad, I will consider getting the headlamps replaced with something that is better. The dead pedal is just carpeted and doesn't have a foot rest, and no official accessories available yet either. I'm looking for aftermarket ones but haven't come across anything yet. With that out of the way, let's first start with the buying journey. As Ive mentioned elsewhere, my previous car was the Celerio which lasted us 8 years, and 53,000 Kms. Ive never had a major issue in the car (touchwood), but Bangalore traffic did give us a fair share of minor scrapes, dents, scratches, which for me are part of ownership. Mind you the first few did hurt, and I rushed to the ASC to get them buffed out, cleaned, repainted etc., but after a point of time, I learnt to let go. For nearly 2 of those years (on and off 6-9 month stretches), it was merely a garage car, waiting for us to come back and drive it again, because of covid. Id kept it maintained, to the best of my knowledge and capabilities, with regular servicing, a clutch replacement (courtesy Bangalore traffic), a battery replacement (5+ year mark, and sitting idle for most of 2020), tyre replacements (42K Kms mark), being the only major changes from how I bought it stock. The high points for me were that it was nimble, extremely rev happy, ate up bad roads with ease (due to it's high (for a hatch) ground clearance), had a responsive and sorted steering, felt planted at highway cruising speeds of 90-100 Kmph, had an airy cabin, excellent (to my years) stock speakers, and was easy on the eyes! I did 53,000 Kms with it over 8 years of ownership, and other than doing duty as our daily driver for anything and everything, we also did several road trips in and around Bangalore, covering Yercaud, Coorg, Vellore, Pondicherry, Hampi, Madurai, Trichy, Thanjavur, Kanyakumari, Rameshwaram (and Dhanushkodi), Udupi and Mahabalipuram, to name the major ones. Sharing a few pics of the Celerio through the years. First long drive from Bangalore to the Lakshmi temple before Vellore. Note the lack of the number plate. This was the weekend after the delivery, and the number plate hadn't arrived yet. Outside a vineyard in Ramnagara around ~2 years in to the car's life. My favourite pic of the car, getting drenched in Coorg. My last picture of the car, somewhere between Vellore and Krishnagiri, from the day before we handed her off, and got the Seltos. But, and there is always a but, the Celerio did start feeling low on power, creature comforts, and space (especially in comparison to 1st the Fabia, and then the 2019 Amaze VX Petrol back home, in which we spent extensive time during covid.) The major reasons we needed a replacement was space (while were a family of 3, we have parents and family visiting us often enough and for family trips, the Celerio started feeling cramped); the deteriorating quality of Bangalore roads, which made daily runs to school, office, etc. start to feel cumbersome; and the knee pain associated with Bangalore traffic in a manual. Plus, with our list of nearby (up to ~400 Kms in one day's of driving) destinations drying up, we started thinking of longer distance trips, but the space and comfort factor reared its head again on a 2nd front, to say that it was time for us to look at something else. That coupled with the availability of the Turbo Petrol + DSG combinations from VW + Skoda, and Hyundai + KIA primarily; plus the imminent (~10 year) demise of ICEs and the coming EV onslaught, made me want to scratch an itch I didnt even know I had. Cue team-BHP to the rescue. I spent a lot of time reading through the various threads, and started creating a shortlist of everything in the ~20L bracket. My first TD was the Kushaq way back in Dec 2022, which my wife and I both had our hearts set on. What came after was the realization that Bangalores road taxes were among the highest in the country, and BH registrations wouldnt materialize anytime soon. With that, I put my plans on hold, since finances needed to be put in order first. In Dec '23, we decided we were finally ready to go ahead with the purchase, and started the hunt. Im putting down our consideration set and what we did with each. Having lived with the pain that comes with driving in Bangalore traffic I didnt want to go with a manual, hence my choices dont include any manuals. Hyryder  Vetoed by the wife in terms of looks and based on her reads of the forums here (she isnt a member, and when it comes to driving, she prefers her Activa 7 days of the week, but shes on here almost as much as I am.) Grand Vitara  I proposed, but the wife said no, so no test drives either XUV 300  My brother-in-law owns one, and its quite capable, ticked all our boxes too (except for the AMT, and having driven a friends Celerio AMT, I wasn't very fond of owning one, but I could still have lived with it, given that it gives so much bang for buck elsewhere.) But it has too little boot space for our use, and that made us scratch it off the list. XUV 700  We considered it briefly but dropped the idea when we realized that the even the AX3 trim with the TC gearbox would end up costing us north of 23 Lakhs on road, and wed get better equipped cars at the same price. Plus, even from the outside the car felt too large for our use. I didnt even get a TD because of both these reasons. Thar  We both loved the looks initially, but had stepped in to the cabin a few months back, at a pop-up stall in our society, and immediately hated it. The rear felt claustrophobic, and strictly for 2, with a laughable boot space. Add to the mix the fact that its a 3 door, hence not really practical for the family (especially ingress/egress for the parents). Plus the loooooong waiting. A friend of mine has been waiting for his 4X2 for over a year now. A 5 door would have been a different story, but looks like M&M is in no hurry to get there. With that, we decided to strike it off our list as well. Jimny  Great on paper, but too small in person, and honestly, it may just have been the car we saw in person, but the fit & finish seemed worse than my Celerio. Elevate  It just didnt feel like the car for us. Even though we spent a lot of time in a Honda over the last couple of years in our home town, the Elevate just didnt feel right for us. Im probably being vain, but the looks were another negative, to my eyes the front of the car doesnt mesh with the rest of it, and that was that. Taigun 1.5 DSG  We loved the drive, with almost zero turbo lag, and butter smooth as well as lightning-fast gear shifts. What didnt work in its favour, was the scoped /bucket style rear seat that didnt seem too accommodating even in comparison with our Celerio. The cabin too felt a little unfinished, with the obvious blanks on the console, and then the cost was also a tad on the higher side, coming to almost 23 Lakhs on-road even with year-end discounts. So even though it was a solid package, it still felt like we would be making a compromise. Taigun 1.0 TC  Felt less refined than the 1.5, and the noise of the 3 pot motor felt very loud in the cabin. Plus had the same issue of the rear seat comfort, and feeling unfinished on the inside. Kushaq 1.5 DSG  While the drive is almost the same as the VW, the ride is a fair bit softer than the Taigun, and the suspension has a lot of play, which I realized when the bottom scraped over a large speed hump (while the Taigun at the same spot, sailed through without any issues.) On paper, and long before we were looking at these cars, wed already made up our mind in favour of the Kushaq. Id read reviews of past Skoda / VW owners and their gripe with the lack of quality / refinement as compared to the past, seemed inconsequential in the real world, but I must say, theyre not wrong. The Kushaq did feel a watered-down product in comparison to our old Fabia, and that eventually led us to place a big question mark around it, plus for 23 big ones, my head didnt feel that it would really be worth it. Kushaq 1.0 TC  Didnt take a TD, but ruled out for the same reasons as the 1.5 / Taigun 1.0 Creta (pre-facelift) SX (O) 1.5 IVT  Cabin felt a little dated, though that may have been our TD car which had ~36K Kms on the Odo, but with all bells and whistles. The driving experience obviously wasnt as grin inducing as the VW/Skoda, but it never felt like there wasnt enough power, for 99% of my driving (highways included.) The rear seat comfort, and space were highlights and we expected ownership to be as hassle free as had been with the Celerio. Plus we had the assurance of having my cousin running a Hyundai ASC back home. He uses a Creta as his daily driver as well, and vouched for it. We had almost finalized it, but again, considering that the facelift was just around the corner, we werent fully sure that we would go for it. But so far, it was looking as our best bet. Venue N-Line N8  While the engine specs are nearly the same as the VW twins, somehow the experience wasnt. The car felt cramped inside, even when compared to my Celerio, the engine felt too loud, and the dark interiors just didnt do it for us. At this point wed almost finalized the Creta, talked exchange value for the Celerio, gotten final quotes, and even gone to the extent of formally blocking a Denim Blue shade that they had in stock. But not for nothing did I say before, that fate had other plans!", 1st March 2024,kia-seltos,Bangalore,14,60,Squeaks/Rattles - Water Leaks - Wind/Road Noise,Very Positive
1847, ShaanS , 10:23 ,Newbie,"Enter Kia in to the mix... I casually mentioned to my wife, after having almost finalized the Creta, that the only brand we havent looked at yet has been Kia, and with it being a sister to Hyundai the mechanicals and electronics should be the same, and we landed up at the nearest Kia showroom, almost at closing time. But to the credit of the sales advisor, he spent time with us, and set up a test drive for the next morning. Seltos Turbo Petrol 1.5 DCT GTX  A little less polished in terms of the engine and transmission response times as compared to the VW / Skoda twins (especially when shifting from D2 to D3), which wasnt as pronounced in the Sport mode. All the ADAS bells and whistles made it so that theres a lot to look at and do while driving. In the ~7 odd Km TD track (a mix of longish flat stretches, inclines, potholed roads, sharp turns etc. that I chalked out with my home as the start and end point,) the 360 camera / blind view monitors made their presence known. Overall, it felt that it was a lot more bang for buck when compared to the VW / Skoda twins, as well as the Creta. But the price was a bit too high for our wallet coming in at 24+ Lakhs on road, and the SA categorically said, no year-end discounts either. Sonet  A close friend has the pre-facelift turbo with IMT, and he vouched for the car being great. We didnt test drive, but since the facelift had already launched, we didnt want to wait for the deliveries to start, especially given that my cars exchange value would depreciate further with the turn of the year. Further, with the Sonet being a cousin to the Venue, and the rear also being more suitable to 4 rather than 5 (based on what we saw in the showroom), it didnt really spark a lot of interest for us. The Seltos GTX did seem a well-rounded package (especially with claims of reinforced chassis points in the facelift), and I kept toggling between the variants page on the Kia website, my bank accounts and my monthly expenses spreadsheet in trying to figure out whats really different, and whether I could afford the additional 4 lakhs, from the initial budget that Id set. I realized that the HTX IVT was essentially the same as the pre-facelift Creta SX (O) minus the Bose speakers, and the e-parking brake. Just for the heck of it, I spoke to another dealer (JSP KIA Hosur Road Bangalore) who said they could arrange for a TD of the facelifted HTX IVT. I test drove the car, and inside, it felt like a more premium package than the Creta. Plus, the lighter interiors as compared to the GTX really opened up the cabin. I didnt feel that the lack of Bose speakers or the e-parking brake were deal breakers. Icing on the cake was that the other dealer had a Pewter Olive (which was the colour that my wife picked) HTX IVT in stock, which had been delivered to them a couple of days back, and were willing to provide ~60K in discounts via a mix of insurance, accessories, corporate, year-end etc. discounts, leading to almost a 1 Lakh difference in what was quoted for the Creta vs the Seltos. With that we paid the booking amount, and scheduled the PDI for the next day itself. Later that night, I spent a lot of time tossing and turning, comparing in my mind the differences between the 2 GTXs (S and +) and the HTX IVT, and it kept boiling down to which variant would we as a family want to live with over a long duration (8 - 10 years horizon, thats the time itll take for EV tech to really mature in my opinion, and for range anxiety to be a thing of the past.) I visited the dealer again in the morning, and had a very long chat with them. What I liked about that experience was that they never tried to push me against (or towards) one variant or another, and happily bounced off ideas, and compared pros and cons of each of the variants with me. This is what finally swayed the decision for me: First, ADAS as a tech is great, and its at a degree of maturity as well, but in my opinion, our driving conditions arent suited for it yet. Second, the Turbo engine is a great performer, but I honestly dont need that much power on tap, especially in the city, and my highway drives are also going to be mostly sedate. The 1.5 NA should serve all my needs. I'm happy to report that this has been true in all of the driving I've done so far. Third, the elephant in the room, the DCT. While Hyundai / KIA DCT failures dont pop as much as VW / Skoda do, the tech is still the same, and the dealer did end up mentioning, that they do deal with issues on DCTs quite often, so its not unheard of. This gets further compounded as the majority of my drive is to be in bumper to bumper slow moving traffic, which is what brings out the worst in DCTs/DSGs. I simply didnt want to live with that anxiety hanging over my head. With that the dust finally settled, the head won over the heart! We got the financials rolling. There was a hiccup in between where the bank official generated a sanction letter with the incorrect type of rate of interest, which I caught before it was too late, so we lost a day in between and then 3 more due to the long Christmas weekend. In between all of this, we were also looking to get in a quick year end trip, and the initial plan was to take delivery on the 26th and proceed with our trip on the 27th, but with the delays, we ended up doing the trip in the Celerio itself. We finally took delivery on the 31st of December, and bid farewell to the Celerio alongside. Attaching some pics of the delivery below. Almost ready for delivery Next to it's X-Line sibling Next to a grey GT-Line The mandatory poses with the car! The car cost me a total 20.72 Lakhs on road (as against 21.30 Lakhs initially quoted). In terms of accessories, I went for the standard accessory package, which included a fair bit of chrome, which I didn't initially like, but after seeing the overall outcome, I don't mind it anymore. I didn't take the my convenience package, but I do have the option of buying it now, but I'm seriously wondering if it's actually worth it. Anyone who's got it, please share your experience, and the value associated with it. I did however, take the Extended Warranty for the 4th and 5th year with a maximum of 120,000 kms covered. Post delivery, I got in touch with Ojas from Esperto Car Care (thanks to reviews elsewhere on the forum), and scheduled a ceramic coating. I went for their 3 year package, and Ojas also added PPF along the ORVMs, door edges, and a few other spots for added protection. He took ~2 days to return the car back to me, and shared regular updates during the process. As mentioned earlier, I've gotten the 1st service done as well, and it was a fairly straightforward experience. JSP Hosur road took ~2 hours to run through their checklist and also do a 3M underbody coat (which was complimentary, as negotiated during the sale.) In terms of accessories, I don't think I need anything major at this point, other than a screen guard for the console & mid, a steering cover, and maybe side steps (after having lived with the car for about a month, I think our parents will need the added convenience, when they visit.)", 1st March 2024,kia-seltos,Bangalore,14,60,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Also if I am not wrong you were earlier considering the Creta over Seltos. Just out of curiosity, what changed? Thank you for your response. We are still evaluating the two. The Creta is definitely favorite in the family for its better looks (subjective), superior seat comfort, ride quality and above all  availability of the NA IVT combo on its top trim. The only downer for us is that sad looking HVAC and inferior plastic quality on an otherwise beautiful looking center console. The all-grey color theme isnt to our taste either. The Seltos, on the other hand, is also a beautiful looking car with more features (particularly headrest for the 5th passenger and backlit windows buttons). What we dont like is all black claustrophobic interior theme in the GT line which makes the cabin look cramped and less premium. We arent a big fan of turbo DCT. Even though it is a technically superior combo, is laggy and jerky in city traffic conditions, but we are ready to consider it if the rest of the things work out. The reason for taking the Xline into consideration is a much premium interior theme, but also understand the maintenance challenges it comes with. And this is where the PPF will be critical to make the final call as it should help protect that matte paint from minor scratches and chips which means lesser instances of repaint. Obviously though, major scratches/dents etc. will need repainting. For now, we are just not entirely convinced with either of the two. The Creta is a better package (for our needs), but the interior is a letdown. The Seltos Xline has a more premium interior theme (not a fan of its center console looks, but its alright I think ), but maintaining the matte color will be a challenge. So, in short, we are yet to finalize, and a great deal of things will look better in favor of the Seltos Xline if the PPF is the solution for matte paint protection and ease of maintenance.", 5th March 2024,kia-seltos,New,478,"1,587",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

I guess there are two hiccups which you are concerned with the Seltos- 1) Dark Interior 2) Jerky gearshifts in turbo dct For (1) you can keep the sunshade of sunroof open and that brings in a lot of light and doesn't feel claustrophobic at all.

DCT is the one that is supposed to be the smoothest in gear shifts out of all the known transmission systems on offer. There is absolutely no ""jerk"", not in traffic, not on slopes, nowhere. On the other hand, ""laggy"" it could be. It depends on your driving style. In 1st and 2nd gear shifts, it is not as fast as a manual transmission usually is. This has changed my driving style to a bit more sedate, at least in lower gears and I find this better, considering the fact that this is a bigger car than my previous i10, which I used to just push through in Bengaluru traffic. It does take some time, getting used to the slower gear shifts at lower speeds but after a while, (just like the black/grey interiors), it's hardly noticeable.

Well, I have been driving TCs and CVTs for a long time now and they are smooth in city traffic conditions, particularly the IVT on our Creta. I have also extensively driven the 1.4 Turbo DCT and always found it to be terrible with initial gear lag and jerkiness if you want to move quick in traffic. But if you drive it sedately, there are no jerks, but then the lag is more apparent in that situation. This is where the IVT shines. No drama, thats how I describe it. Just far superior in such situations where most of our drives take place. The DCT gearbox often gets confused and just doesnt feel seamless. The same response we had during our multiple TDs with different TD cars from different dealers (yes, we wanted to be sure and thus tried multiple samples). So in case we do go with the DCT, will have to calibrate our driving style. For further validation, our own teambhp official review has also called it out as below. However, we did notice that the gearbox got a little confused on a few instances while driving through some traffic. Anyways, I dont want to sway from the initial query on matte PPF.

Would love to hear from the Xline owners as well about their experiences and suggestions on how one should go about maintaining the matte paint . Fellow Seltos X-line owner here. Its almost been 6 months since I purchased the car and 5 months since I applied Avery Dennison matte ppf from a local detailer. The car has been very easy to maintain ever since. The applicator did a pretty good job with fit and finish of the ppf. You need to identify a good applicator. It's as important as the quality of ppf you choose, if not more. So far, luckily I haven't scratched or banged my car in any way thanks to ADAS which saved me once when I almost collided with a vehicle infront. So I have no experience of how ppf will hold up incase such a scenario occured. On the hind side I am free from swirl marks and minor superficial scratches and the car looks as good as new after simply cleaing it with water and a microfibre cloth. I haven't even observed a rock chip even though I take my car out frequently on the highways. The obvious difference between a new and an old car is that the paint of the old car over time gets dull because of direct exposure to atmosphere(dirt, dust, pollution )and UV rays along with several swirl marks which develop while cleaning the car and ppf helps prevents both those things thus maintaing the original shien and finish of the paint. All in all if you want to keep your car looking as good as new, ppf does a fantastic job especially in darker colours like we have in the X-LINE. And since a matte ppf is non reflective it is even better because there is no orange peel effect that we get in glossy ppfs. It looks super clean.", 6th March 2024,kia-seltos,Raipur,104,249,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

I completely agree people would like to keep their cars looking new for long. I am however against the principle of applying PPF because it is necessary. I know of people who spent Rs. 3 Lakh on wraps for an Alto because it looks cool (and it does!). Just that for me, spending 1.2 lakh on 24 lakh stings a bit. I would like to address a few misconceptions. Matte Paint cannot be detailed: It is not true. Only the final step of machine polish is to be avoided. Matte finish is like normal paint except it has a special type of clear coat called Matting Agent. So your regular car shampoo wash and car care can be done. More details can be found here: https://www.infinitywax.com/blogs/ne...atte-paintwork Car detailing damage paintwork: Detailing, if done properly does not damage paintwork. It involves removing the dust and debris from the panels and 'filling in' the gaps in the clear coat. Doing it often helps the paint 'recover'. Only if products with abrasives are used will the paint get damaged. More info can be found here: https://www.detailingdevils.com/blog...etailing-myths Also, I was not implying to paint panels but the whole car. In fact except for CBU and to an extent CKD's, none of the production cars have a great 'Factory Finish'. The factory paint is uniform for sure, but it is uniformly average. A skilled human painter can still produce a finish far greater. PPF can only protect minor scratches. For fender benders and deep gouges, it cant. https://gleamworksdetailing.ca/uncov...r-your-vehicle Add to that the cost of replacing the panel, repainting and replacing PPF, it would be an exercise in excess.", 6th March 2024,kia-seltos,Hyderabad,84,132,Entertainment/Navigation/Connectivity (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

All of this happens within 3-4 seconds. The result is similar to when in manual, we keep the clutch depressed and push the accelerator, there is a sudden rise in RPM. A driver is not expecting this kind of response on braking and can be caught unawares, get distracted and can lead to an accident.

1892, Col Mehta , 13:04 ,BHPian,"Thank you everyone for the pointers on the matte PPF. I think from the financial standpoint, PPF indeed is an expensive solution to maintain and protect the paint work. This is particularly true for a regular glossy paint, but for a matte finish, it’s very much a good option for a couple of reasons. 1. Ease of maintenance - Okay, how many of us have time and energy to involve in rigorous routine of washing and cleaning the matte paint which needs special care? Things like two bucket method sound great, but is it doable for everyone on a daily/regular basis? How many of us are willing to risk it by giving the car to the regular car cleaning guy with that abrasive cloth that will damage the matte finish a lot sooner than you expect. And how many of us have the luxury of covered parking where there are no external factors ready to damage the matte finish - bird droppings, dogs jumping and scratching etc. Not too many I would assume. That’s where, IMHO, PPF is essential for a matte paint. Once done, you dont really have to worry about a lot of maintenance headaches which come with a matte finish. But for a regular glossy paint finish, I wouldn’t bother applying any PPF as it’s a lot easier to upkeep and get it corrected. 2. Paint protection - Yes, many would argue that PPF will protect only against minor scratches, chips and swirl marks, but that’s quite enough as most of the times that’s what you get - minor damages which will (hopefully) be taken care of by the PPF. Any major damage will always need repaint/repair/replacement which is fine. The only downside, as I said earlier, is the financial hit. But you are not going to spend another lakh for applying PPF on the damaged panel, but only a fraction of it - which is still very much a financial liability but who doesn’t want to keep their car in pristine condition especially when you have got yourself that beautiful matte paint. And as Mr Anderson aptly put, you know what you are getting into when you get a matte paint car. Unfortunately though, a lot of consumers accidentally buy matte paint cars and later realize their mistake as they just dont have the knowledge of how to maintain it or have the time or resources to do it. And they end up spending more money in keeping it together, sometimes repainting which can be expensive too. A matte PPF, even though an expensive solution at the start, will make sense to a lot of these guys and eventually save time and efforts which cannot always be quantified in monetary terms. All these things make me believe that a matte PPF is almost imperative when you have a matte paint. But for someone, who has time and resources to upkeep it, it will not make sense, which is absolutely fine. And thats why I'm very much interested to know from the Xline owners how they are able to cope up with the matte paint in general.", 6th March 2024,kia-seltos,New,478,"1,587",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
1893, Mr Anderson , 13:07 ,BHPian," Quote: Originally Posted by blogslogger I would like to address a few misconceptions. Ofcourse you can clean and shampoo a matte car. But what detailing also involves is paint correction that removes superficial scratches and swirl marks that are often confined to the paint's clear coat. Buffing, rubbing and polishing are important parts of detailing process that bring out the lost shine of the car and that have been done since the time cars came into existence. These procedures cannot be done in a matte paint. It's these same processes that remove a layer of the clear coat. So in essence, you cannot remove even a superficial scratch/swirl marks from matte paint like you can in a glossy paint. You'd have to redo the entire panel. Yes ppf cannot protect against deep scratches but that was never the purpose of ppf. It's sole purpose is to protect from minor superficial scratches, swirl marks, rock chips and keep the sheen of the original paint intact. The car, especially a darker coloured one, never looks old. I almost invested 3 months to carefully study things that can be done to protect a matte paint and nothing other than ppf fitted the requirement. It was a tough decision to invest the amount I invested but now when I look back at my car that still looks like it came out the showroom and the ease of maintenance and protection against general wear and tear (not deep scratches), it was worth it. Most of my travel is on an under-construction road mostly behind big buses so you can imagine the risk of rock chips and I have yet to see one. When I come back home there is a thick layer of dust that covers my entire car which can be cleaned with water and microfibre cloth easily without any risks of swirl marks. For a month after purchase of my car I didn't dare to take it out for work out of fear until ppf was applied.

Should I instead change my booking to Creta DCT or go with Seltos DCT itself? Thanks I was also in the same dilemma 4 months back. But went ahead with DCT for my peace of mind. 1. More important thing than distance(~30kms) is your driving behavior. Whether you are going for office, mall or anywhere, If you are driving at 30-40kmph at low rpms, due to traffic and all, or if getting stuck in bumper traffic frequently, then DPF issues will arise. More the ""low speed"" for high intervals, more the DPF issues. 2. To perform passive regen(which occurs automatically if you have highway drives at 60-70kmph at 2000-2500rpm), you need to drive the car for 50-60mins. OR you can have active regen which takes approx 30mins. and will consume extra fuel. So, if your sole purpose to drive on express way is to have passive regen, indirectly you are wasting your fuel/money and same in case of active regen which requires fuel. Add to that additional diesel maintenance and a constant worry of DPF clogging in the mind. 3. Never heard of any health issue from my friends who own diesel cars. 4. If you liked DCT, you should change your booking for sure. Whether Creta or Seltos is your personal choice. I loved Seltos both its exteriors and interiors as compared to creta. Hence, my only options were HTX+ iMT and DCT(HTX+,GTX+). Took test drives, liked DCT, finalized it, and currently after 50 days and approx 500kms(only infrequent city driving till now), loving DCT. Getting approx 11KMPL and yes, there is a couple secs lag in first 2 gears. But, no jerks at all. DCT is definitely more responsive and fun to drive. Also, If you use Auto start/stop and Autohold properly, DCT will definitely have a good life.", 7th March 2024,kia-seltos,Jodhpur,63,74,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

Hello - If your primary usage is going to be within the city, there is nothing better than IVT. It's smooth, lag free, jerk free and easy to maintain in the longer run. Use the Sport mode with paddle shifts and you would like it on the highways also. Believe me, it's not a slouch when you know how to play with the power band. Of course, not as good as turbo DCTs on open roads, but then DCTs aren't that great in the city traffic conditions. Not entirely sure about their reliability, but there is always a risk with these complex turbo motors and DCTs are prone to overheating (some might say they are not due to ISG/Auto Hold which I would consider only with a pinch of salt - I would like to believe it but only when I see a supporting published documentation, until then, I wouldn't rely on what I read online). You need to be super careful how you drive it in stop and go traffic, unlike TCs and CVT/IVTs which are just far superior in those conditions. We are also contemplating Xline which comes with DCT and are a little nervous when it comes to its long-term reliability. I will not recommend diesel as they come with DPF headaches. Plus yearly run of mere 8k just does not demand for it. You would be better off with either the Creta SXO IVT (if you are okay with its underwhelming interior) which comes with all bells and whistles, has excellent ride/seat comfort, better resale, service network and extended warranty coverage (7 years) or the Seltos DCT (if you like it better and are okay with all black interior) which has more usable features. From safety POV, both KIA and Hyundai claim that they have made improvements, but until these two cars are crash tested, it's hard to say which one is better in that regard. And you are correct in your observation - the doors on the FL Creta do have more weight in comparison, but then it's not necessarily conclusive. Difficult spot to be in - good luck!

More so, when I checked the facelifted creta in person in the showroom, it seemed to give the reassuring thud. Perhaps I may be wrong here too! 1) Kia has now added ISG and Auto hold in Seltos. In theory if you keep both/either ON, the clutch would be disengaged and hence it's life prolonged. I do subscribe to this, because I have been trapped in hour long traffic jams, and I keep both engaged, so never received any transmission warning yet. Regarding Hyundai SA pushing the IVT, it's purely because of demand and supply gap. He definitely has much more stock of IVT equipped variants since Hyundai currently only offers DCT in one trim. 2) In metro cities both command good resale. But Creta brand has had a huge following since it's long tenure. At the moment Creta will definitely command a slightly higher resale. But since Seltos too has been a highly successful product for Kia, it might be the only one that would rival Creta in terms of resale in this segment in future. 3) Since both cars underneath are actually similar, whatever improvements that could have been done would be similar in both.

Hardwiring is done in the fuse box. It has fuse adapters and connected to ACC and VCC. It is in 'Parking Surveillance mode' when the engine is switched off. As far as my understanding goes, dash cam uses it's internal battery to stay in standby mode and only demands power from the car when the its battery is low. The hardwiring kit also comes with inbuilt car battery protections which ensure that the car battery doesn't go flat. I've been using the same camera from the last 4 years in various cars and none of them had any issues. Even when I didn't drive the car for 3 weeks.

1928, Black Panther , 20:32 ,Newbie,"I've been meaning to write this review for quite a few days now and finally got an opportunity to compile my buying experience, drive experience, likes-dislikes, additional jobs that I got done on the car etc. Buying experience May 2023 I was scouting the market for a decent car as my Celerio was beginning to show its age (its about 10 yrs old, but still running and I would love to keep it as a beater car). My budget was hovering around 15 L and wanted to get a bang for the buck product. Online reasearch has begun with cars like Baleno, Nexon, i20, Honda City, Seltos, Verna, Rapid, XUV 700 etc - covering the whole spectrum. Each car had something going for it, but I couldn't convince myself to buy something which I was not sure of on a high level. Have checked out Toyota Hyryder which a friend of mine bought, liked it and was in my final list of cars alogn with XUV 700. With the news of impending facelift of Seltos, thought to wait and watch. I may sound a bit dumb when I say that I didn't do any test official drives of other cars - but have driven Baleno, Hyryder, XUV 700, Nexon and City. I had my reasons for not bringing most of the compact SUV cars into contention. I very much liked the looks and features of the first gen Seltos and luckily the facelift didn't disappoint (I went to the extent of being a bit nervous about the FL just before the launch wondering how would it look, if it will be at par with the then model or if Kia would screw up the design with FL like other brands have done earlier etc.) Before the launch, I had my eyes set on GT line and was almost ready to go for it after the price announcement. But I was put off after seeing the all black interiors and also that it didn't have a HUD now (it was my fav from first gen). The next best option was X line, of which I was never a fan owing to its maintenance and the lack of colour options. Of course the looks of it can sweep anyone off their feet - was always a gorgeous looking car to my eyes right from first gen. Now I was in a dilemma whether to pick GT line and forever sulk on what Kia did or risk it and go for X line. Frankly I didn't consider any other variants as I wanted it to be feature rich but also partially due to the weird design of the brochure which was confusing as hell and I didn't want to break my head to understand that (learnt that HTX+ was indeed a VFM product ticking most of the boxes that one would need). Had to put this decision of buying a car on the back burner for a while as I had to address a few other pressing issues of life. Nov 2023 Fast forward 4 months, I was again at it and finally heart winning over mind, decided to go for X line Petrol. Took the test drives (of GT line) about three times from two different dealers and liked the drive, look and feel - thereafter got the all important green signal from wife and booked the X line. Waiting period of 2 months was totally fine with me as I specifically wanted a 2024 make. From the very first interaction, I was firm that I will not take the dealers insurance unless they match with what I get online and also that accessories should be completely optional. There was some resistance from the dealer, but I didn't budge - at the end they agreed to the terms. My SA was in constant touch during late Dec and first half of Jan 2024. One day he rang me up and tells me the the car has been allotted and being shipped the next day and is expected to be at the stock yard in about 2 days. I was really excited and couldn't wait for the vehicle to arrive. More so because it was supposed to be a surprise for my kids and parents, I kept this news of a new car under the wraps for 2 months, was a very difficult 2 months of my life indeed. On the day of the PDI, I called my SA to confirm the time - and he utters something which dampened all the excitement. He tells me that the vehicle shipped was of a 2023 make. A huge disappointment. How can that happen? He clearly told me that the vehicle was allotted to me, now suddenly what is this 2023 make stuff all about? All kinds of questions were running in my head. After a few minutes I could understand that he was forced to lie to me, probably because they prioritised the delivery to someone else for reasons best known to them. He told me that he can get another vehicle in 2 weeks time and I was in no mood to believe him. In a couple of hours he calls me and offers 2023 for a discount of 1.3 L. Was lucrative, but I said I will take it if he can better that discount still. He tried, but couldn't get the discount number further more. Now he throws a date of 3 days from now for another car, which I didn't believe. I quickly called up other dealers to enquire about 2024 make X lines and voila, the other dealers had them ready in the stockyard. I told them about insurance and accessories. One of them rejected the proposal, the other one agreed. On the same evening, went to their stockyard, did the PDI (crushed my fingers in testing the anti pinch functionality) and was fairly satisfied. Paid the booking amount and told them a delivery date. The D-Day Finished the payment process a day in advance and informed them the accessories that I would need and was asked to come around 11 AM for the delivery. My entire family along with my brother's family reached the showroom and saw that it was all prettied up and ready for the unveil. The sales team gave a few goodies like mugs, chocolate box and explained about all the documentation and the features of the car. Had a very smooth experience and had finished the entire process in about an hour and had the Kia Connect activated in about 2 hours. Driving Experience Soon after we took the delivery the first thing I did was to disable to FCW feature. And later on the same day we drove to 'Statue of Equality' (about 90 km from my place) taking the Outer Ring Road. I must say that I was awestruck by the vehicles smoothness and power. I could test all the ADAS functionalities during the drive and was pleasantly surprised by the impeccability of SCC - this is a must have feature especially while driving on highways. The drive was very relaxing (not that I relaxed ) as the car was taking care of the slight manoeuvring. Switched on the navigation and thought that its detailing is better than Google maps (ofcourse the destination points might not always be searchable as in Google, but does the job by and large). The HUD was displaying the key information including the ADAS warnings, music stations, speed limits etc. (but lacks a few essential metrics like RPM, which gear, current mileage etc which I saw in Baleno). High speed stability is good and the system throwing all kinds of audible warnings at you - you'll be forced to stay attentive. So far have completed about 800 km and have postponed the first service by a week for a few pending works that I plan to do. Likes - Engine, love the power available at your disposal. - Feature rich - Looks with fit and finish. - Auto hold is truly godsend and works well in tandem with ISG - In-built navigation (which I am yet to upgrade to a newer version) - Ventilated seats - Interior color combination, the color of seats looks awesome (but what's with the name sage green? I havent seen an iota of green on those) - Panaromic sunroof (loved by kids, I am aware of the perils of standing through the opening and have never let them stand while driving) Dislikes (and nitpicking) - Headlights, not up to the mark. I might upgrade to projectors (saw something on Instagram, quoting 55k) - The suspension may be a little stiff to my liking (Baleno is relatively smooth), but have to reduce the tire pressure and check. Have never been in any seat other than the driving seat since the day I bought and though I didn't hear any complaint of discomfort from my family members - could feel that the ride could be a bit bumpy for them at the back. - Not value for money, should have included few more essential features like memory function of electrically adjustable driver seat, request sensor on passenger side, cooled glove box etc (ofcourse there is no end to what one can wish, everyone wants more ) - The unit should have had wireless connectivity. Hearing news that we would get that in the upcoming upgrades, which never come. Have resigned to the fact that it wont happen now, as it is a hardware limitation. - The HUD display position can only be adjusted via the screen and not by any physical buttons. - KIA should find a way to be able to get the Google maps location URLs open in their in-built navigation (because not all locations are searchable and people share the location links via WhatsApp/SMS etc.) - Didn't really like the bulky connected tail lamp design and the blacked out tiger nose grill (you'll see in the following pics what I did to satisfy myself) - The tiny square area of the screen to show updates like weather, sports etc - the feedback to Kia is to increase the font size of the text (of the sports tab), its barely visible unless you peel your eyes. There is also lot of unused screen space on the bottom half of the square. For all those struggling with speaker grill reflection on the windshield - I have accidentally discovered a workaround - use polarized sunglasses. Additional jobs - PPF and Ceramic coating - got it done last week with Kavaca brand PPF (7 years warranty) by Ceramic Pro and costed me Rs 1.5 L. Also, got the front grill and the tail lamp wrapped as I didn't entirely liked the stock look. - Getting all the 4 brake calipers painted by the service center. Will be done prior to the 1st service and have been quoted 8500+GST That's all for now and will try and keep updating this thread in future on mid/long term experiences.", 9th March 2024,kia-seltos,Hyderabad,19,24,Squeaks/Rattles - Water Leaks - Wind/Road Noise,Very Positive

1936, abhi3284 , 22:17 ,BHPian,"Completed 1 month of Ownership today with my Hulk, read GT-Line. ODO currently stands at 498 Kms. Minimal running so far. Have just done 1 Fuel Fill-up, measured Auto cut-off to Auto cut-off and it yielded 10 kmpl as the 1st Mileage figure with approx. 70% City and 30% Highway running. Have mostly run in Normal Mode and some Eco Mode. Not used Sport Mode yet. Seltos feels like a huge Upgrade coming from my earlier Ritz and it Rocks in all departments... be it the Super smooth refined Engine, the seamless DCT Transmission, the Classy and Luxurious Interiors, and all the ADAS Features which work like a charm as expected. Most importantly, my left leg is thanking me everyday for not having to deal with the Clutch. Though my right leg is still complaining a bit with slight pain around the Knee cap area, while i still try to find my optimum seating position. As i used to sit lower in the Ritz and was used to it, if i set the Seat Height on my Seltos all the way up to give the best bonnet / road view, it is causing some pain. Or I dont know if it is due to the angle / height difference between the Floor and A/B Pedals that is causing some strain. Did not anticipate this lingering issue though as a comfortable Seating Position is Critical. Anyone faced similar issues while transitioning from a smaller Hatch to a C-SUV? Hoping to overcome this issue and make peace with it soon as i am looking forward to munch a lot of miles. Will be getting the 1st Service Check-up done in the next week. Quick question for those who purchased only the Extended Warranty and not MCP Package. I see 2 options for 5 Yrs EW at 19k for upto 120,000 Kms coverage and 24k for Unlimited Kms coverage. 1.2L Kms is a lot of Kms to cover in 5 Yrs and i feel that should suffice and it is also 5k cheaper than the Unlimited Kms one.

1946, 07CR , 18:21 ,Senior - BHPian,"Past 3.5 Kms have been an excellent experience on my Seltos GT Line DCT. NVH, space, acceleration, equipment, ADAS all has been spectacular experience so far. My only grouse was with headlights of the car. For a car costing this much, headlight intensity surely had a huge scope of improvement. I also have a Sonet HTX iMT Turbo P, and I am satisfied with it's lights. I expected Seltos to be atleast similar to Sonet in terms of effectiveness, if not better. Sonet light pic for reference. Trouble no more- I came across Bhpian @Behemoth's post wherein he mentioned projector lamps with brackets are now available for Seltos. I spoke with contact provided by Behemoth, and he quoted me an outrageous 27K for 2 inch bi led projector fog lamps (Genome). I kept looking for alternatives and came across Xenon planet BI LED laser 2 inch fog lamps on my Seltos Whatsapp group. The seller was in Delhi, and agreed to ship the bracket, projectors and relay wiring. He mentioned that he would guide with fitment of the same on call and it's easy process. It was NOT!! None of the garages (even big one's) in Pune were open to installing these. Meanwhile, I was in contact with Genome's distributor and explained him my situation. Just like other shops initially even he declined me saying they cannot install other lamps, either purchase the same from them and then install or install it from somewhere else. Fortunately I was able to convince him and he shared me Genome's technician's number. He came and toiled for around 4-5 hours. Turns out it was an extremely tedious process. I was worried if all the ADAS/front parking sensors/Camera etc would work as intended, but the technician reassured me about it. Must say he was extremely skilled person, as he took enough precautions at each step, and did a fantastic job. Here are the results- The projectors Low beam of only fog lamps- Low beam of headlamps + Fog lamps- Low beam and high beam of all lamps- Total Cost= Lamps+Brackets+Relay+Delivery = 14500 Technician's installation fee = 4000 ( I paid him 500 extra considering his efforts) Note- Goes without saying, the high beam can be a huge nuisance for oncoming traffic, and I plan to use it only when necessary.", 11th March 2024,kia-seltos,Pune,"1,419","4,090",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

I am not sure about it though. Anyways, I was not concerned with electrical warranty hence gave the go ahead.

Easier because sometimes the key would be in our pocket and it may be a hassle to unbelt, reach for it while sitting etc. Quote: Originally Posted by Flasshhhh The first time I was asked to open the boot by a guard, I too was searching for a lever, but eventually used the key to open the boot by pressing unlock button.

Hardwiring too does not drain battery as during parking surveillance mode, dashcam stays in a low power state, using its own battery and when the accelerometer detects movement it is switched on. It uses car batter to recharge itself later.

1981, TorkBHP , 22:53 ,BHPian,"BHPians, pleased to share that I bought home my new KIA Seltos diesel AT GTX plus on the auspicious occasion of Mahashivratri (8th March 2024). A big thanks to teambhp forum & the posts of many experts here, as it made my decision-making process that much easier. Sharing my buying experience & review of this car which should hopefully help more folks like me to take an informed decision on whether to buy this car or not & various other aspects about it - I am writing about my car buying experience & its review after >7 years so there is some obvious excitement but I will try to state my comments & observations as objectively as possible (although some aspects would be subjective). Background - I have been using a Creta Diesel MT anniversary edition (SX plus) for the past ~7 years so it will be the reference for justifying a change & reason for buying a new car. I live & work in Mumbai & all my travel is by road. Due to the ever-increasing traffic in the city, Id been contemplating for the past few years to switch to an AT (for the first time after driving various manual cars for almost 30 years - As you grow older you tend to give more importance to convenience & practicality vs excitement & control ). Top priorities / my expectations / must haves in the new car  AT due to reasons mentioned above, efficiency on daily running costs (~60 kms daily), feature loaded (including level 2 ADAS), quality of product (fitment, etc), ageless design, service reliability, fun to drive & panoramic sunroof. Cars considered Scorpio, XUV 700 Body roll, too big / butch for my taste, reported reliability issues MG Astor / Taigun / Kushaq Lack of diesel option meant that these options had to be dropped at the initial stage due to efficiency reasons. Honda Elevate Positives  Good space management, VFM, comfortable ride, extremely practical, efficient petrol engine. Negatives  No diesel, Lack of panoramic sunroof, level 2 ADAS unavailable, front grill looks overdone  too large looking as if the mouth is split wide open. Cabin is nice but did not feel luxurious. MG Hector Positives  Loads of space Negatives  No AT in diesel, low efficiency, maneuverability was average with some evident body roll & few parts in the cabin were not of top-notch quality. Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder / Maruti Grand Vitara Positives  Good efficiency in petrol & excellent in hybrid, reliability & service of both Toyota & Maruti, Good features Negatives  Petrol seems underpowered & hybrid leads to loss of boot space. Internal & external design is above average (doesnt invoke a wow expression on any front) TATA Harrier Positives  Space, safety, awesome looks, chassis from the house of Land Rover, good implementation of ambient light, comfortable ride. Negatives - Low efficiency, fit and finish not upto the mark, QC seems to be an issue at few places (experienced during visit to showroom & also various users have raised concerns), feedback on servicing not upto the mark, price of top model was ~30 lacs on road (company registration), lack of physical buttons for basic operations (eg HVAC), too many glossy places  a fingerprint magnet (which reminds of the logo display in place of the horn button  god knows what the designers were smoking ) Creta FL (2024) Being a creta user & the way my existing one served me, new creta 2024 was the first choice. Infact, I had also booked it (before seltos) on the day of its launch (2nd Jan 2024) which I eventually cancelled. Positives  Ride comfort & service standards, other positives are similar to new seltos (as there is a fair amount of common bin features that both these sister concerns use). Negatives  The product strategy of Hyundai on design & features (which at one point of time used to be their strong hold) has been going downhill for the past few years. Skimming on features like rain sensing wipers (was available in my i20  a ~13 year old buy), lack of dynamic display, lack of customization on ambient lighting, above average interiors even on top of the line variant (eg. HVAC looks like its from a 10 years old car / sub 10 lacs car), too much gap in front grill (safety concern), uninspiring facelift design (eg. Black treatment given to side silver band only on N-line - Just because HMIL wants the higher variant to look comparatively better, they are literally making the top of the line variants look less desirable - not a good strategy). Rear LED straight-line strip looks like its designed by an amateur / novice. These led to deciding against the creta - I have moved away from Hyundai after 13 years (i20 + Creta). So finally, it was Seltos due to reasons mentioned in the latter half of my review. Buying experience - Once I zeroed in on the Seltos, I went hunting at various dealerships for attractive deals. I booked the car in Feb as I got a good deal (decent discount & some free accessories - total benefit of ~1 lac, as it was a Dec 2023 model). The sales manager at Shaw Kia BKC Mumbai seemed to be very eager & professional (a good combo in such situations). Colour chosen was glacier white pearl (My son loved the pearl glitter in this colour) & variant - GTX plus as it has all the bells & whistles. I plan to call the White Tiger  A reference to the grill design & black accents (stripes) on white colour. Opted for my convenience luxury package as it included 5 years warranty & pre-paid periodic maintenance. Since it was a Dec 2023 manufacturing, I visited the stockyard twice just to be doubly sure that the car was not used for display or any other purpose (showed only 11 kms on the ODO with all protective plastic covers / stickers intact). Since the vin number of this car was blocked for me, I tried to register on KIA Connect (KC) during my 2nd visit to the stockyard as Id heard horror stories of the way drivers drive the car from stockyard to workshop & also use it for other purposes. Had more reason to worry, as the distance from stockyard to workshop was ~ 52 kms. Alas I couldnt activate KC at stockyard as it seems KC registration has to be done by the dealer only post which activation is possible (ODO showed 11 kms @ stockyard, 71 kms @ workshop & 76 kms at showroom). Two checklists helped me ensure all was in order as per my expectations (TeamBHP checklist & a BHPian user made custom list for seltos  forgot his name ) Delivery experience at the showroom was good overall except for some misses by the workshop on getting the car thoroughly cleaned in a timely manner. Tyre air pressure was 45 PSI at the time of delivery  Whats with service centres & over inflating tyres This is an issue observed across various service centres. Got it corrected post-delivery during a fuel tank up. Quantity of pre filled fuel was less. I was told its 5 litres but DTE showed 8kms by the time I reached the usual preferred fuel station which was only 20 kms away from the showroom. Accessories - I opted only for the essentials - 3D floor mat, Mud flap, Door edge guard, trunk sill guard, screen protector & cup holder coaster (pics attached). Avoided too much of chrome as its not to my taste. Initial impressions (Driven only ~400 kms) Uff the convenience of an automatic. I had an ear-to-ear grin during the first few kms. On a lighter note, they should ban manual transmissions . Not just the transmission but almost everything is auto in this car which Ill cover shortly. The car is loaded with features & the following points being incremental over my 1st gen creta (Diesel MT anniversary edition SX plus) Positives 1. All windows auto up & down (anti-pinch)  Starting with the most controversial of all, which was silently removed by Kia in their 2024 line up (except for X-line). This feature has a strong use case (especially anti-pinch) as highlighted by some users. Family was super happy that they too get an auto button & not just the driver. As a bonus, all of them are backlit. Happy that I got the 2023 model. 2. Rear window sun shades  This is a delight for all family members who occupy the rear bench during summers (wife & mother were happy to have this in built) 3. Rear seat recline  Adds to the comfort of the rear bench travelers. Again an added comfort for family members. 4. UV glass  Solar glass on the front windshield and all door windows prevent harmful UV rays from entering the cabin. It does make a practical difference during summer / daytime. 5. Ventilated seats  This is such a boon in Mumbai summer that the rear benchers are now jealous of the front benchers 😊 6. Dual zone climate  Although I am indifferent to this feature, my son was excited, as he prefers cooler temperature vs what the other occupants want in the car. 7. Cabin lights (Reading & ambient)  Four led reading / task lights which cater to most traveler needs with individual buttons & dimming function on engine start & off. Theres also an override automatic switch off of cabin lights incase you forget to switch off one of the button while leaving the car. Customized ambient lights are fancy & add to the fun factor. 8. Auto headlights  Its good that the lights come on automatically in the evening or in any other dark scenarios (especially when you enter a tunnel / parking lot). Adds on to the experience of convenience. 9. Auto wipers  Its a must have in a city like Mumbai where it rains for 3-4 months in a year. My 13-year-old i20 had it & now after years of missing it in the creta, I am getting to enjoy the same feature again. 10. Auto chromatic IRVM  This is very helpful during night driving as it prevents the rear traffic headlight glare from disturbing you while driving. As a bonus it also has SOS & Kia connect buttons. 11. USB slots & charging points  2 in front (A + C-type) & 2 for rear (C-type) passengers are helpful in need of emergency charging 12. Air purifier  Not sure if this is gimmicky or of real use but initial impressions suggest that it does make the cabin air seem cleaner. 13. Panoramic display (MID & AVN) - both displays are of top notch quality and they are key in making the cabin feel more upmarket - Dynamic & ABC themes are damn good on the MID, it also auto dims when lights are turned on (tunnel / night / etc). The amount on information that both displays provide is quite overwhelming. I still have been spending time getting used to all the menus after 7 days of fiddling with the settings . 14. TPMS  Such an underestimated small bit of info this is Itll save me from two scenarios. (A) In case of puncture, itll serve a timely reminder possibly saving tire damage by ensuring timely action & also avoiding a possible accident due to a flat tire. (B) No one will be able to fleece me on highways saying that tire pressure is low & you seem to have a puncture (have experienced this once). 15. Fuel consumption info  The MID provides information that can help understand & make me conscious about which style of driving is more efficient for fuel consumption. Current observation - Highway: highest  23 kmpl, average 17. City: highest  16, average 14. Still early to comment but seems to be better than my MT especially on highways (refer to pic). Will have to wait for the 1st servicing post which efficiency would be clearer. 16. D cut leather steering  While some users have opined that this type of steering is more suited to F1 cars, I feel it does help ingress & egress for the driver & looks sporty / upmarket. 17. Electronic driver seat  Both buttons (bottom & recline) provide enough & precise custom seat adjustments to suit anybodys requirement 18. Voice commands  Multiple commands adding to overall convenience eg. Open sunroof, open / close all windows, make calls, etc  A handsfree control for most features. 19. Remote key fob quality & functions  Amazing design, looks like a key of a high-end car (buttons on the edge avoid accidental presses). Remote engine start is a good to have feature especially during summer days when the car gets piping hot (due to the all black interiors) 20. Electronic parking brake  A good-to-have option but I have not used it much. 21. 360 degree camera & parking sensors  Helpful in tight situations. Camera automatically switches on in certain situations (However, the 360 degree image stitching could have been better) 22. Drive modes  My observations are not based on data but more on feel basis experience; Eco (less fuel injected, upshift at lower RPM vs other modes), Normal (regular fuel injected while upshift at a bit higher RPM vs ECO mode), Sport (regular fuel injected while upshift at an evident higher RPM vs normal mode). Overall quite nice to have the user control the driving experience of the car. 23. Traction control  More on this feature in a later review when I get the opportunity to try this feature. 24. ISG & Auto hold (AH)  Both these functions are good individually & they work even better when both are activated simultaneously - At traffic signals, AH ensures convenience (by not having to press brakes or change the gear to parking / neutral) & ISG ensures efficiency (by switching off the engine  although it does start automatically after sometime without any inputs from me) 25. Paddle shifters  Flawless shifting with just a tad bit of delay (command vs action). Adds fun to the driving experience & ensures that I dont miss the MT. 26. All disc brakes - Inspire confidence while braking without making too much sound as heard in some of the other AT models (eg some German cars) 27. Panoramic sunroof  Three broad positions viz. open sunshade curtain, open sunroof & tilt open sunroof. Amazing fun feature for the whole family. Son & wife love it. My evening drives from office are now more fun with the sunroof curtain in open position (waiting for the rains now ). 28. ADAS level 2  This feature has the potential of a detailed article but Ill try to summarize the key features. Lane keep assist (LKA)  Autonomous steering is amazingly accurate if the roads are properly marked with lane borders (Car steers itself effortlessly on Mumbai Pune expressway or Mumbai Freeway). Smart cruise control (SCC)  You set the speed & rest is taken care off by the car even in slow-down, stop, restart scenarios (add to this that small button of pause & restart on the steering makes SCC just too good). Rear traffic collision avoidance  Already a couple of saves while reversing (This was due to the system being over cautious but its always better to have such a cautious / preventive approach rather than emergency braking or possible dings / dents on the rear) 29. Kia connect  Plethora of functions some useful while the rest are either gimmicky or a show off. In any case they are all good to have (Ones that I liked the most  Start / stop engine, lock / unlock door, vehicle status, valet mode, climate settings, car location & send next destination to car before start of travel  All in my mobile). 30. OTA software update  On the first day itself I got a notification that theres a software update available. The best part was that it asked to switch off the vehicle & the update took care of itself (generally, we have seen that devices ask us to keep it on so this was quite a delight). One change I noticed after the update was that the volume scale decreased from 70 to 45 (Although same output at max volume but higher volume is now released at a lower scale). Miscellaneous observations 1. Enhanced safety body structure  Although Hyundai seems to have gone overboard on advertising this change in their facelift, for some reason KIA did not emphasize on it in as much (pics attached FL Creta vs FL Seltos) 2. NVH  Top notch as it has negligible in-cabin noise / vibration despite being a diesel. IMO its the best in comparison to all the other diesel options available right or experienced earlier. 3. AVN finger rest platform  Awesome touch feel (quality) & strategically placed to ensure that its convenient for the user to operate the touch screen while driving. Good but not great 1. Ride comfort  Ah the elephant in the room Overall balanced (after ensuring the right amount of tire air pressure  cold 33 PSI, hot 35-36) but has a bit of skew on the stiffer side. Confidence inspiring experience on speed bumps & at high speed with the steering weighing up appropriately. Family opinion was that our old creta ride was more plush & add to that the soft seat cushioning made the ride feel better in Creta (including under thigh support on rear seat). KIA can take some bit of this best practice from its sister concern. Smaller RIM & higher profile tires could have also made a positive difference here. 2. Tyres  OEM JK tires are decent but have an odd size 215 / 55 / R18 (Currently not too many alternate options available in this size for a switch  Hopefully there will be more by the time I get to a change requirement). Apollo Aptera could have been a better choice for all GTX & above variants, which I saw as OEM on one of the dual tone GTX plus variant. 3. Headlights  Although good if you compare it with the old creta but could have been better in comparison to what some other cars provide in the same segment. 4. Black interiors & upholstery  Looks sporty but is a dust & heat magnet. Also makes the cabin seem to be smaller. KIA should have given an option to customers for choosing the colour scheme of upholstery / interiors; especially in the higher variants (the brown & beige options look good in the lower variants). 5. Audio quality  Music sounds nice but I expected much more considering its a BOSE. I will wait for the speakers / amp to break-in but as of now, it seems more brand hype & comparatively lesser real life quality. 6. Fog lights  Good but the LED intensity / power could have been better. 7. Horn  Has a nice sound containing a deliberate wave & not just the regular flat kinds. The issue is with the horn pad as each time I press it theres a khat sound when the horn pad rebounds 8. Door  Although the closing sound is good it isnt as reassuring as the new creta. No car is perfect & so does the Seltos fall short in some areas Negatives 1. Absence of wireless android auto  Whats wrong with the Korean twins they have this feature in the lower variants but its absent in the higher variants. Quite disappointing. (Anyways I have already ordered for CarLinkIt wireless CP / AA  will post a review later on this) 2. Absence of electronic driver seat memory  Sad that KIA skipped this one as it gets very inconvenient if you have another member in the family who shares the car (drives) with you. Every time theres a different driver, he / she has to struggle with seat adjustments. 3. Drive mode memory - Normal drive mode is selected by default at every engine start & not the last one I selected. The driver should have had the choice here. 4. Limited control of ORVM  They dont fold under certain conditions (eg. above 10 kms / hr). I tried to do this as there was a speeding car from the opposite direction which was way too close to the ORVM while I was in motion (~30-40 kms/hr). In such scenarios the driver should have the option of retracting ORVMs as a preventive measure (considering the cost of changing the mirror which has a camera & ADAS warning light inbuilt). 5. Rust on silencer  Poor quality metal used or is it absence of rust preventive coating (refer to pic). Either ways this was quote disappointing to see. 6. Bottle holder  Poor implementation as all bottles lie in diagonal sleeping position with the common ones having play while stored. It makes them susceptible to movements while driving & also during high music volumes leading to unnecessary vibration / noise. 7. Absence of boot net  Its a protective boot net which keeps small stuff in the boot secure in one place. It was available in my 7 year old creta. Although they do have hooks in the boot for the net, KIA decided to give this a miss. Overall, the car seems to tick almost all the boxes I expected. Hope that I have provided useful bits of information for fellow BHPians. Request the mods to PM / guide in case there is any point that is not as per defined process.

All variants are equipped with rear sunblinds which are very effective in blocking heat. And for front for most situations you can use the manual sunshades. The higher variants are also equipped with UV cut glasses. 44 K is too high a investment imo especially if your car is a HTX+ onwards ( these variants get UV cut glasses) Quote: Originally Posted by TorkBHP Negatives – The product strategy of Hyundai on design & features (which at one point of time used to be their strong hold) has been going downhill for the past few years.

Rear LED straight-line strip looks like it’s designed by an amateur / novice. These led to deciding against the creta - I have moved away from Hyundai after 13 years (i20 + Creta). Congratulations on your new car ! Mine is same variant and in white but turbo petrol! Agree completely on the messed up product strategy by Hyundai. Seltos is way more loaded than the similarly priced equivalent Creta variant. I can understand people going for sx(O) ivt variants of creta since seltos does not offer ivt in top most trim. But I am a little surprised at people choosing Creta over a similar seltos variant (top diesel AT, turbo petrol AT), as the only potential advantage the creta has is it's wider service network, but at the cost of lot of equipment missing.", 15th March 2024,kia-seltos,Pune,"1,419","4,090",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

2001, vijay.s , 21:43 ,BHPian,"Hi all, Need help in choosing between the Hyundai Creta Turbo Petrol DCT Automatic / Creta N-line N10 DCT automatic / Seltos GTX Plus DCT Automatic. The Seltos being relatively old is getting some handsome discounts to the tune of Rs. 40K plus basic accessories kit free. However, there are no such offers for either the regular Turbo petrol Creta or the N-line Creta released just this week. When compared to the Regular Creta Turbo Petrol DCT Automatic, there is a price difference of approx 50K and approx 1L when compared to N Line DCT automatic. Note this difference does not account for any accessories beside the basic kit for 6K being provided by Hyundai. However, In seltos, I am getting 25K worth of accessories free too which the dealer refused to convert to cash in addition to the 40K discount. Is the price difference worth going with Seltos. Reason I am asking this question is primarily from the standpoint of safety being emphasized by Creta. I could personally feel the heaviness when lifting the bonnet too and even in the doors of facelift creta. Anyone else caught up in similar confusion?

2009, Chugh_H , 13:01 ,BHPian,"Sharing a small update on my GTX+ DCT; I have now completed 7500kms with my car and by the end of this month, I am expecting to add another ~2000kms to my odo. I have enjoyed the ownership so far, car has been a joy to drive within city limits as much as it is on the highways. I am satisfied on most accounts (yes, even suspension) except that one back of the mind feeling that in case of an unfortunate crash, the body structure could have been stronger. There are obviously a lot of things that could have been better with the car, but as an overall package - it still holds a good rank in this price range. No regrets so far. The reason for this update is something else though. About 3 weeks ago while I was driving on my usual commute, the engine check light lit up along with a warning on the ICE screen to contact service centre. I called customer care, and the representative confirmed it is okay to drive the car to my home (~7 kms) as long as the check light is not red and the car is not behaving abnormally. They also connected me to the nearest service center (Allied Kia, Gurgaon) and the service manager promptly connected me to the front desk so I could book an appointment. Fast forward to the weekend, I took the car to service; I couldn't capture the error code on picture but it was something around 'Higher rpm than normal'. The service advisor recommended throttle body cleaning which is what they did and then cleared the error code history after a test drive. I could not sense anything wrong with car's behavior throughout this time. My earlier car (Ford) had an engine wiring issue which cropped up in the 2nd month of ownership, the car was taken to a service center and it took them ~4 days to deliver it back to me. These kind of things don't bother me much to be honest as I understand all mechanical things could fail at any point, but the service I receive when the sun ain't shining is how I benchmark companies. I will have to say my understanding of why the aam junta puts so much weightage on good service when buying a car has got better after this instance. Ford is good, Kia is even better! All reps acted like they were invested in their company, and conscious that they represented Kia and not their own service center. They explained to me why such things could occur, explained what they did and how can I reach out to them easily if something crops up again. Special mention to the service manager - Surinder Kumar - he walked to me every ~10 mins while my car was in the service bay and ensured I understand that it was not a big issue and what would they do if re-occurs. I rate them 10/10 on service. FYI, I am not affiliated with them in anyway. Pictures of the engine check warning attached below for reference. I am curious to know if anyone else who has used 1.5T for >5k kms have faced such an issue, couldn't find anything on the forum / internet so seems to be a one off sensor issue.", 18th March 2024,kia-seltos,Delhi,41,222,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
