2, .anshuman , 09:00 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"The second-gen Baleno was launched in October 2015. It was the car that helped Maruti’s premium car Nexa division get traction. The S-Cross, which was the only Nexa car before it, had not managed to attract many customers. The Baleno, over the years, has been very successful and one of the best-selling cars in the B2 segment and the country. It is positioned above the Swift in the Maruti’s model line-up and is the company’s only competitor for the Hyundai i20, Tata Altroz, VW Polo and Honda Jazz. This makes it a very important car for Maruti. With the considerably more modern third-gen i20, going on sale in 2021, it was important for Maruti to give the Baleno some updates to keep its appeal strong. The updated Baleno gets major changes to the exterior as well as the interior. The car gets new headlamps, radiator grille, front bumper, L-shaped tail-lamps, changes to body panels, a new squarish side profile and slightly smaller quarter glasses. On the inside, there is a new dashboard along with some new features like head-up display, 360-degree camera system, new touchscreen infotainment head-unit called SmartPlay Pro+ along with an Arkamys sound system. The interiors are still black, but now gets blue inserts on middle portion of the dashboard and one the doorpads. The seat base is now firmer and there are some changes to padding of the backrest and side bolstering. There is also a Suzuki Connect Telematics System with connectivity features like access through Alexa Skill and a compatible smartwatch. Other interior changes include rear a/c vents, fast charging USB ports at rear, cruise control and sliding center armrest for the front seats. The safety kit has also received a major update. Six Airbags are now standard on the top two variants, along with ESP. There are changes to car's structure as well. Maruti claims “extensive usage of high tensile & ultra high tensile steel”. The kerb weight has increased by 55 kg, though we're not sure how much of it contributes towards increase in structural strength. The updated car comes with only a single petrol engine - the DualJet naturally aspirated 1.2 K-Series unit that produces 89 BHP and 113 Nm. This engine is paired to either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed AMT. The older CVT automatic has been discontinued in favour of the AMT transmission, which has made the automatic variants cheaper. There is slight increase in fuel efficiency as well. Other mechanical changes include a hydraulic clutch system, all new suspension and bigger front disc brakes. Maruti also claims improved NVH. Maruti Baleno Exterior Review Front end features new headlamps, bumper and new NEXWave radiator grille: 3 piece DRLs inside the headlamps are called NEXTre' DRLs and a similar theme will used for upcoming Nexa cars. Headlamps are LED projectors and foglamps are also LED type: Front camera (part of the 360 degree camera package) is mounted on the radiator grille: On the sides, the round curves have been slightly squared off now and there is a minor change to rear quarter glass design: The car gets new 16"" diamond cut alloy wheels and a chrome strip runs along the window line: Shoulder line has a squared off appearance compared to the curved shape of the older version: Side cameras are mounted below the ORVMS: Rear end features squared off bulges along with squarish tail-lamps: New L-shaped LED taillamps look fresher, but may not be to everyone's taste: Rear camera position remains unchanged: ", 2nd March 2022,maruti-baleno,Good-Gaon,"7,763","11,054",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
3, .anshuman , 09:00 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Maruti Baleno Interior Review The new dashboard feels way fresher and apt for the premium positioning of the Baleno in the segment. The plastics, though not in league of the i20 (which is the class benchmark), don’t feel cheap either. The lower part of the dashboard - the dark blue coloured portion is made of hard plastic feel. A few switchgear parts remind you of other Marutis. The seats have been redone. A welcome change is that the seat base is now firmer compared to old car, which was way too soft and made long drives tiresome. There are slight changes to side bolstering and padding of the backrest as well. All in all, the front seats are large and comfortable even for a tall person like me. The steering has tilt & telescopic adjustment. Finding a comfortable driving position is easy and the ergonomics are sorted. The new steering wheel is leather wrapped but because it is a flat bottom unit, it looks out of place. It would be more suitable for a sporty car like the Swift. The new HUD is bright enough even for under the bright afternoon sun and displays a good amount of driving data. After few minutes of driving and getting used to it, I completely stopped looking at the instrument cluster. The only thing I missed in the HUD was navigation. I had to constantly look at the infotainment system for the navigation directions. Dual tone dashboard is black with a dark blue middle portion along with a thick silver highlight insert. The design looks and feels fresh, it doesn't look as bland and monotonous as the previous versions. The overall feel is a lot more premium compared to the previous version. The part quality is a mixed bag with some plastics are still hard and feel built to a cost and are nowhere near as nice as the Hyundai i20. Wide angle view of the dashboard. The center armrest can be slid forward, but the action feels too loose: New leather-wrapped, flat bottomed steering from Maruti parts bin adds a sporty touch to the interior: Audio and infotainment related controls are located on the left spoke, while the right spoke holds switches for the cruise control system: Instrument cluster feels more mature and sober with the funky blue lights and highlights gone. Even the MID has more pleasing fonts and display: MID display similar information to the outgoing car. Power and torque meters have been replaced by a G force meter: Small, retractable transparent glass head-up display pops up above the instrument cluster. This is how the popped up HUD looks from outside: Position and the brightness of the HUD can be adjusted. The brightness levels are excellent even on a bright, sunny afternoon. Display screens include speed, rpm, time climate control settings, fuel economy and gear position (AMT): Buttons to control the newly added features i.e. HUD, ESP, 360-degree camera system and traction control are placed on the right side of the steering wheel: With a long press the ESP and traction control system can be turned off. Once turned off, the ESP stays switched off irrespective of the speed the car is doing: Black & dark blue theme is carried over to the doors as well. Armrests get soft artificial leather padding: Door pocket can take 1L bottle. Power window console is from the Maruti parts bin: Center fascia features a 9"" touchscreen infotainment head-unit with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support connectivity has good resolution. No prizes for guessing where the a/c vents below get their inspiration from. Climate control console is new: Touchscreen head-unit's display resolution is good. With its large size, it can display a lot of information. The Arkamys sound system sounds way better than outgoing car's basic unit: A host of information and alerts & warnings are displayed on the head-unit: In the satellite mode of Google maps (via Android Auto), the resolution of the map is excellent. Scouting for a photoshoot location was a breeze with this display configuration set up: Updated car gets 360-degree camera system. While the camera resolution isn't as good as the display screen, the camera system has various display options, which make parking in tight spots easier: Reversing camera gets adaptive guidelines: Left most display shows the front left wheel. This is of help when parking next to kerb in urban surroundings: 12V power outlet and type-A USB port, which can be used to connect your smartphone via Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, or just for charging it: Glovebox is on the smaller size: Rear doorpad is slightly changed. It gets a small map pocket now, but the bottle holder looks smaller: Space in the rear is excellent - same as the outgoing car: I am 6'2"" feet tall and just about fit in without my head touching the roofliner. If I move my head backwards, it touches the roofliner: Rear passengers now get air-con vents. The twin vents have independent horizontal direction adjustment, but a common vertical direction adjustment and air volume controller: Two USB ports have been provided below the rear air-con vents - a traditional type-A port and a type-C port, which supports fast charging: Boot space is rated at 318 liters. Though smaller on paper than the outgoing car (339 liters), it feels about the same size: Rear seats can split in a 60:40 ratio for cargo flexibility. With the rear seats folded down cargo space is massive: ", 2nd March 2022,maruti-baleno,Good-Gaon,"7,763","11,054","Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive
4, .anshuman , 09:00 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Driving the 1.2L Petrol MT 1.2L DualJet K-Series petrol engine is an updated version of the old engine. It now makes 89 BHP & 113 Nm: The first thing I noticed when I got into the car was how silent and refined it is at idle. Of course, this is the newer version of the 1.2L K-Series. The old engine was a gem and this was to be expected. This car feels quieter than the old one and even its sibling, the Swift. Starting off from a standstill is smooth. The clutch is very light and the anti-stall system is well tuned. Even with the additional 55 kg kerb weight, the DualJet engine feels peppy. While driving in city traffic, there is a decent amount of pep. Pottering around in the traffic, the anti-stall system and low-end torque ensure good drivability. I tried slotting int 5th gear at 30 km/h and the engine did not stall. Even at such low revs, there was no audible sign of the engine resisting or knocking. Of course, there is no power at such low revs though. Once the roads open up and you floor the accelerator, that’s where the K-Series engine shines. Being a 4-cylinder unit, it is smooth and loves to be revved to redline. The only downer is that the mid-range could have been stronger. Maybe nowadays, we are just used to the surge of power we get with turbocharged petrols. Outright performance is good and engine excels when it is being pushed hard. That being said, the performance cannot match the i20's 1.0L turbo which produces much more horsepower. The Baleno MT has an ARAI rating of 22.35 km/l, which is 0.95 km/l more than the old car's. Bonnet gets insulation on the underside just like the older version: Metal covering above the fender lining on both sides is missing - just like the older version. Damaged plastic fender lining can lead to ingress of water in the engine bay: Air-con compressor looks unusually small: Finally, there is a plastic plate under the engine for protection: Driving the 1.2L Petrol AMT It is clear why Maruti has opted for the AMT instead of the mechanically superior CVT when you see the drop in prices of the automatic transmission equipped variants and the published fuel economy numbers. They surely know their market and what customers want. But, the enthusiast in me disagrees. The AMT does not offer as refined a driving experience as a conventional automatic transmission, be it a CVT, traditional torque convertor or dual clutch automatic. AMTs have come a long way since their introduction. This AMT is surely way better tuned than the earliest AMTs. Compared to older AMTs the start off is smooth. The gearshift is well mated to the engine. Of course, with a single clutch, the shift times are typically AMT. Start off without any throttle input on a flat road and the car crawls forward gently. You can feel the slight mechanical judder of the clutch release. In the traffic the shift logic is well tuned - almost feels like a proper automatic as long as you keep the throttle input light. It surely offers the convenience of an automatic. Middle level throttle and moderately aggressive driving is where the AMT and conventional automatic transmission gap starts to widen. For overtaking on undivided roads, I seriously recommend using the manual mode and choosing the right gear in advance. Try not to change gears in the middle of the maneuver, even if it means revving the engine to redline or holding a gear at higher revs, as the shifts take a long time. In D mode if you are driving hard, for the duration of gear change, there is a brief interruption in power. Maybe the engine hits the rev limiter first and then the gear shift happens. It is much smoother with slightly less throttle input and when gear changes happen below the redline. The Baleno AMT has an ARAI rating of 22.94 km/l, which is better than the MT. The AMT gear shifter. Unlike other types of automatics, there is no P mode. Only the handbrake holds your car when parked on a gradient: Suspension Another major change in the updated Baleno is the new suspension. The suspension still is tuned on the softer side and at low speeds the ride is good. The overall cushioning is top class. I tried jumping a few sharp edged speed breakers and car cushioned the impact pretty well and stayed composed. At high speeds, there is not much up and down movement. There is no audible suspension noise in cabin, even when the car hits in deep potholes. The Baleno's handling isn’t as sporty as that of the Swift. The car behaves like a bigger and more mature vehicle. Its high speed stability has improved a lot over the old car. It is only when you get into higher triple digit speeds that you realise it is a lightweight hatch and not a German sedan. However, at moderate and lower speeds, there is nothing to complain about. The change in suspension has clearly brought about a big change to the Baleno's ride and handling. The steering is light and typically Maruti. The self-centering urge is not at all strong. It feels disconnected like most EPS units, but weighs up decently with speed. Disclaimer: Maruti invited Team-BHP for the Baleno test-drive. They covered all the travel expenses for this driving event.", 2nd March 2022,maruti-baleno,Good-Gaon,"7,763","11,054",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

6, Rajeevraj , 09:47 ,Distinguished - BHPian,Terrible decision to move from a CVT to AMT. Why would Maruti do that for their premium hatchback? Especially since all the competitors come with proper ATs. The CVT was definitely a plus point for the Baleno and I think it is a bad decision to move to an AMT.

A brilliant product from MS too, the Baleno already commands a 65% share in the premium hatchback space, I think with this facelift it could go well above 70. Maruti always seems to disrupt the tech trends in the Indian market, in 2015 IFRC, they were the the first in India to offer Carplay and later Android Auto and now, the 360-degree camera system in a sub 10L car.

10, buzzy_boy , 10:02 ,BHPian,"I would buy the new Baleno over the i20. Reasons 1. Latin ncap found the body shell to be stable in frontal impact tests. The vehicle fared poorly in side impact - which I hope the new improvements address. 2. GDI engines don't have a long track record in India. They require premium petrol, and fuel adulteration is common in India 3. New interiors are much better 4. The only disadvantage is the AMT, but I can live with a manual.", 2nd March 2022,maruti-baleno,Chennai,276,"1,516",Features/Controls/Displays (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

We booked one (Alpha AGS Blue) for regular use replacing our 7 years old Celerio AMT but we are waiting for a test drive to confirm or a refund. We could get one allocated for a delivery in a week but we didn't want to rush it up without a test drive. I am not expecting CVT standards but is it as annoying as the Celerio AMT or has it improved ? How's the ICE setup ? Is the Cruise control effective ? Do you think the build quality has actually improved ? Also, in person, the 360 view did not look very effective with a scattered stitch.

14, Turbokick , 11:05 ,BHPian,"Excellent review as expected 👍 While every move Maruti took with New Baleno was in the right direction, the decision to opt for AMT over the CVT is bit bewildering. Even Tata did hold back in having AMT for Altroz (which i believe is readily available) to have that proper automatic (DCT in this case) for the position of the product. Baleno would end up then being the only car in the premium hatchback segment without a proper automatic option (jazz, polo, upcoming altroz, i20 all have one). Some people would argue about the cost saved and the f.e. but one needs to understand that the CVT actually transforms the engine characteristics completely and not just a automated gear changer. A CVT drives completely different from its manual counterpart. (Imagine doing 100@1500 rpm against the MT doing 100@3000 rpm). That itself is worth the extra money the manufacturers charge in general. Hopefully Maruti sends the Baleno for a crash test and gets good score. Much needed thing right now.

I recently sat in a friend's Dzire AMT and it had some judder from standstill in first gear, and that was at 14000 km, I know for sure the AMT is going to get even more jerky later on.

24, vineetklkrn , 17:44 ,Newbie,"Thanks for the detailed review. I have driven Dzire AMT 2018 model for 4 years and now owning a Honda City CVT. I will provide my point of view w.r.t. AMT vs the CVT. I moved to Dzire AMT after having driven manual for 3 years. And it was a delight as it is after all an Automatic. So if you compare with Manual for sure the convenience and comfort in an AMT is unmatched for a very less premium over it. Also I got used to the AMT very quickly, and was never much bothered about the jerk while shifting the gear as it can be easily smoothened out by playing effectively with the acceleration. In this review I understand that the AMT is further improved. So I am sure the jerky movement will be a non-issue once you learn to handle the acceleration effectively. Now if I may talk about CVT, it is again a very pleasant upgrade and coupled with IVTEC engine. For the additional premium, it is not a VFM but certainly more convenient especially while overtaking on highways as you can simply rev and need not bother about playing with the acceleration to smoothen out the jerks. After having compared the two, as I said your convenience is already obtained when compared to manual even with AMT. However if you are an enthusiast and want to rev hard without any hassle CVT is better. Lastly I would like to add that after 4 years of driving AMT I started getting little issues while shifting from 1st to 2nd. It was no more that smooth and took longer at times. So looks like the AMT box does cause issues over long period of usage. I never got it checked as my lease was due and had to sell the car. I cannot comment on long term performance of CVT as I have started using it only a month ago. Hope this helps potential buyers.

It's heartening to see a serious attempt to 'provide' to the customer. However, some of the changes reek of intentional ""that will do"" attitude - (1) the front central AC vents are a joke (2) the surgically removed portion of wheelwell sheet metal is disgusting (how much did they save from cutting it away ? probably balancing off the cost of having to provide some sort of engine undertray) (3) poorly done headlamp plug sockets (inviting water to enter) is negligence. What's the use of having a male-female plastic encased waterproof socket design, if the wiring that is fed to one of the socket has not been insulated well, exposing the wiring tunnels to water/moisture ? Personally, I feel it's a very competent product, tailored well to suit the indian car buyer, but can't help the feeling that some positive minded new product leadership were eventually kept in check by the old guard whose product definition motto has been ""cut costs, at all costs"".

I got a chance to Test drive the vehicle on the launch day at the dealer and would like to list the observations. Door panels and other sheet metal quality has gone up to more than satisfactory levels. This is a 4/5 star contender on NCAP. Opening and closing of doors has decent heft. Bonnet and Hatch feel solid. The cabin layout and controls are excellent. HUD is a nice addition and worked well in bright sunny condition also. The instrument panel looses its blue tinge of the previous version and becomes grayscale for most screens. I liked the previous one better. I drove the manual and happy to report the Clutch is super light and steering self-centering is highly improved. No more sticky steering with the new update. Suspension is softer and NVH levels were really low with good insulation against all road noises. Cabin Cooling is excellent with rear A/C vents also supporting with cool air. 360 camera is a novel feature and is very usable, in fact it leaves a lasting impression of the car having advanced features. 6 airbags in top 2 of 4 variants makes it the most affordable car with this feature. Prefer the looks on the darker shades which have a deep gloss finish. Although even the rudimentary silver was looking 'splendid'. Paint finish is top notch with finger prints smudges requiring frequent cleaning. Front look is butch. The blue shade is menacing and suave. Zeta has these plain looking alloys, can be painted up I feel to give the Alpha look. Left to right, Sigma (base), Delta (2nd), Zeta (2nd from top).

He was all surprised to see a Maruti with this kind of interiors and features. Had a very short drive and I was sitting at the back during the drive. It gives a big car feel and cushions out most of the bad roads easily, and he has finalized on it. His friend was very skeptical, said he couldn't distinguish old and new ones, and said many times that current i10 (which he owns) is much better than this.

This car may not satisfy people who are either such fan-boys or anti-Marutians, but for an average customer who are open to choices, this is a good package. The platform is the same Heartect (but with more structural rigidity as per Maruti), and overall appearance is more or less the same though most body panels including bonnet, doors, rear hatch, both bumpers and lamps are changed.

56, deetjohn , 06:07 ,Senior - BHPian,"I don't think this is a new model. This one is more like a midcycle refresh. A little more skin deep than what we normally get in our market when it comes to a facelift. Equivalent of what BMW calls LCI probably! A new model change or generation change is much more substantial. The new car can look very similar to the older one it replaces, but the manufacturers starts from the clean sheet of paper. The second gen Swift was most definitely a generation change! Coming to the Baleno, the body panels are more or less the same here. It was so bad in the last car that even the fenders used to ding and dent even with the slightest of pressure/ impact. Earlier, we could see that only with the doors, especially the rear ones on a Maruti. What they have now done is take the same panels and given it a stronger crease, check those fenders! That in itself will give the sheet metal a bit of strength compared to simply rolling it. Do it with a sheet of paper and you'll know what I mean here. Sure, the metal sheet itself might also be a grade thicker, but the car really needed that. One can slightly change the parameters of a spring or a damper and call it new suspension too, so don't go by all that Maruti is claiming here! And we are going to see this more and more now! More model refreshes (much more substantial than what we have here with the Baleno) compared to generation changes.

63, Nanolover , 07:09 ,BHPian,"Hi ,full model change happens in its true sense when the entire BIW itself changes. The dead giveaway for this will be a change in wheelbase ( only possible with a new BIW interna panels/ floorpan). Also the body rigidity figures will be mentioned. For the Baleno,it is a facelift. All attachment panels like ,fender ,bumper etc might be new ( remember these are just attachments to the BIW and in no way are part of the structure,technically you can remove all these and drive around). Another easy giveaway will be the same shape/profile of the doors/ boot and the side profile. This wlll be same with some small gimmicks like door beading or window sash in chrome to fool our eyes. Having said that a lot of improvements beyond a facelift ( like they did for the wagonr r ),no denying that. Like mentioned in another post,this trend was started by toyota in Japan, I think for the crown and all. Two generations of crown ran on same platform. interior and exterior styling were changed,but the gve away was the side profile. The doors were still the same. Closer to home the same was done long time ago for the M800 facelift and the zen facelift. This practice allows manufacturers to claim all new and also bring changes in 4 years to the market ( Japan used to follow 4 to 5 year lifecycle).

67, Gupts007 , 19:06 ,BHPian,"Well, IMO - a facelift is a usually a cosmetic procedure done to an aging car so that the manufacturer can get some more sales numbers with minimal investment. As per my understanding, the new Baleno has ALL new body panels - even though the side looks remarkably similar to the outgoing design, the crisp body line that originates at the rear fenders continues till the front fender as opposed to the flowing body line in the outgoing model. The latest design has been given haunches that makes it look more aggressive instead of the erstwhile curvy design. Since the new design is unmistakably Baleno, it is not perhaps coming across as a new car. The inside too as we all know, practically feels like a new car. I think I heard during the launch that they spent close to 1100 crores on designing and releasing this new Baleno. I am not sure though how close this amount is when we compare it to a new release from ground up. A new engine and chasis I am sure would have cost them a lot more so that way they sure have saved a chunk. Perhaps that could be one reason some of us are having trouble accepting this as a new release and thus christening it as a facelift.", 7th March 2022,maruti-baleno,Chandigarh,185,305,Entertainment/Navigation/Connectivity (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

They certainly achieved that and then some, because it looks perhaps a little too much like the car it replaces, to the point that many might mistake it for a mere facelift. That couldn’t be further from the truth though, as this is a brand-new model from the grounds up, with entirely different body panels, a completely new interior, improved safety and lots more equipment.

79, xodus99 , 22:00 ,Newbie,"I was looking to buy the Ignis Delta and customize it, then chose a Swift ZXi for its bigger size and better performance.. The Nexa guy asked me to look at the Baleno. I had an opportunity to take a short TD and here are my observations: It feels like a premium, laid-back car. The clutch was superbly light, and the gear shifting experience was good. I had a very short TD because of the traffic situation in Thane, but I didn't have to work the gear box much - there is decent pick up even at 10-12 kmph on 3rd gear and the engine seemed decently relaxed when pulling. I felt the turning radius was large in the two U-turns that I did - but I would love to hear other bhpians share their views here. The steering is very electric and didn't give me that feedback like the Swift or Ignis did, but it was doing its job well, and Suzuki seems to have finally found the solution to the steering return issue. I didn't get a chance to drive this at speeds more than 55 owing to the traffic. The engine packs a punch, but is more suited for sedate drivers, i.e, me :-P If you are a light footer like me, I think you will like this car and is definitely not for enthusiasts.

In Japan, since there is absolutely no demand for Sun Roofs, Suzuki has not developed it's platforms for the same. It is doable for tall boy cars however which are inherently space centric. 2) A raised height card naturally increases drag and reduces FE.

85, Aaditto , 04:22 ,BHPian,"I have been trying to make up my mind about which car to buy, for a couple of months now. In fact, I started a thread on the ""What Car?"" sub-forum, seeking help from T-BHP experts, to try and zero in on a 'dream car' for myself. On that thread (Middle-aged middle-class man seeking help in buying his 1st & last car) [now closed] people poured in with some amazing insights and guidance - which has helped me substantially. Towards the end of that exercise, I mentioned that I was hoping to get a TD for the New Baleno, sometime soon... And responding to that, @Kosfactor mentioned (Middle-aged middle-class man seeking help in buying his 1st & last car) - Quote: Since you are onto a car hunt, Let us know what you think of the new Baleno after a test drive, K series is the last good NA small petrol engine - which also happens to be fitted to an appropriate car. I finally got that TD - where I live and work - in a rural area within close proximity to a highway-connector. So, here's my two-bits on the new avatar ~ Some points that worried me, before the TD:-A lowish GC (170 mm) Issue reported by a friend regarding the front bumper fouling too often with high speed-breakers (in the outgoing model of the Baleno) Maruti's invariable inability to get the aesthetics of a car right (I am an artist by training - and I know for a fact that aesthetics is really about very well defined calculations, as opposed to a common belief that it is a matter of subjective taste) The fact that the outgoing model had such dismal NCAP ratings Some hoped-for improvements that I was looking forward to, before the TD:-In the photos, the new avatar looked really sorted - in the 'looks' department The reported tweaking of the suspension as well as the transmission - addressing some of the known issues with the older version The report that Maruti had in fact put in extra focus on safety with the new avatar - 6 airbags (a major point of attraction for me) & heavier sheet-metal The resultant extra kerb weight - which should logically add stability to the vehicle The already well-tested and refined 1.2 lt. K series engine getting a Dual-Jet injection system - which would hopefully add to the driveability My feelings - after the TD:- FOCUS ~ Low GC / Problem with front bumper vs high speed-breakers / Differently tuned suspension & Transmission improvements I started the TD by taking the car over a metalled village road, with lots of 'local' speed-breakers - which leads to a pretty nasty dirt-road - going through a reserve forest, and emerging on to a highway-connector. In the initial part of that track, my speeds varied between 30 - 50 Kmph. And once on the dirt track, it was curtailed to about 20 - 30 Kmph.The transmission seemed just perfect! Light clutch with short travel - and the customary smoothness of well-slotted Maruti gear-shifts. I'd say it was amongst the best I have handled from Maruti during my recent TDs. Even when I threw the car into 4th/ 5th gear at low speeds (20-30 kmph), there was no apparent discomfort - though the gear-shift indicator did keep reminding me that I wasn't driving in the optimum gear! So was the suspension - remarkably good! No problem going over multiple speed-breakers - even at a brisk speed. On the dirt track however, I had to be more cautious. Although, once the speed was lowered, the car handled the nasty potholes much better that what I expected. Towards the end, I deliberately took the car over a series of three really high local speed-breakers - and could not see any reason for worry, regarding the low bumper-lip reported by my friend. FOCUS ~ Looks / Comfort / SafetyThis is probably the first time that Maruti has got the exterior aesthetics to be near-perfect! From every angle, the car looks really well balanced and smart. The only 'flaw' I could find was the 'dot' lights lingering on from the older version, within the tail lamp assembly (the break lights). Even though they have reduced the number of those 'dots' - which went all around in a half circle earlier - they have chosen to linger on with them all the same. That, for me, has always been the most incongruous part of the Baleno's design! It brings on a completely different design-language, which does not gel with the rest of the car. The interior is just as smart. Not overdone - but quite plush. The seating position for the driver was excellent - and they have added the height adjusting mechanism. I thought the i20 (which I TD'd a few days back) lags behind in that department - the new Baleno seemed to give me a much better view - and it felt less slunk-in. The second-row leg room seemed really extended - it looked even more that the S-Cross to me! However, as a result the boot space has been reduced. I personally did not see the point of the compromise - but then, I am not a tall man. The seats seemed nice too - with prominent support from various angles. Though they did seem a bit too soft to me - and I wondered how a long drive would feel in them. I did quite a bit of Finger-NCAP testing - all around the vehicle. The the heavier sheet metal was quite apparent. The bonnet hood was not flimsy either. And inside the bonnet there was ample space (it could have easily accommodated a larger engine), with nicely organised components. The engine guard down below was also a reassuring sight. FOCUS ~ Driveability / Powertrain / Dual Jet effect / StabilityFor the first part of my TD the car drove beautifully. The usual progressive and smooth Maruti power delivery - almost noiseless refinement - peppy pick up. But once I emerged on to the highway connector - I was remarkably disappointed! I have recently TD'd the Ignis - with the same 1.2, and without the dual-jet. That was a far superior drive - above 60 kmph. The baleno, with it's added weight, was just outright sluggish. Even with a downshift to 4th gear, at speeds around 60-80 kph, the car was still struggling to overtake trucks in front. I am a light-footed driver. But even when I revved the engine, in frustration, I did not find the power that I expected. And the most disappointing part was the severe body roll and lack of stability - when I did a few quick swivels on the steering, at higher speeds. All that added weight notwithstanding, the car seemed really skittish and not at all planted, in spite of it's rather wide wheel track! In fact, I felt more confident with the Ignis in that department, compared to the heavier, lower and larger Baleno. The steering itself, however, displayed much better centring, compared to any of the other Marutis I have driven lately. MY TAKE-HOME ~The new Baleno is a great looking car It's a worthy package for the 'premium' mnemonic It is a competent city vehicle It's no where near as good for highway travel I had read a report somewhere (not sure if it was here on T-BHP), before the launch of the New Baleno, that there was a possibility that Maruti might bring on the 1.5 Lt. K series engine (S-Cross/ Brezza) - maybe as an option - in the Baleno. I really wished they had done that! My sense was that it would have made this car a much better package. It's not for me!

Yes you will feel the shifts as you would feel even in a manual driven by someone whose clutch release and gear shift are less than perfect.... The kickdown is bad though... Lag is very noticeable there as you want an immediate move but it will disappoint.. Then lag and the jerk is in your face.... However once it chooses the gear it will go all the way to the red line where it will shift up. For this reason urgent overtaking will be an issue. I had booked the Automatic in the early days when they had just started talking booking unofficially because I didn't want to wait if I decided to buy, I wanted to have it asap. Now I'm in a bit of a dilemma. Whether to wait for the Brezza or just bite the bullet and get the AMT Baleno. For spirited driving this AMT will remind you on each shift that it's an AMT. For regular city use the shifts are noticeable but only just. In Chandigarh they've installed 2500 cameras on the roads to keep a check on speed and other violations so spirited driving is technically non existent now. So practically the AMT shouldn't bother. One big negative is that it does not have a P mode and the vehicle is only going to be held by the hand brake when parked. As we all know after a while and repeated use the hand brake ability to hold is degraded for the vehicle particularly on a slope. I tried stopping the engine in D and then pushed the car to see if it will move or hold. It moved so that's not an option. I don't know if that's a limitation of an AMT...P mode not being available but yeah .. That's an issue i think. The front seats are supremely comfortable and large but lack support cuz they are so soft and no lumbar support is available for long drives comfort. The doors though are very heavy compared to the previous Baleno which I own. It's night and day difference I could tell straightaway.

My thinking was this could have totally been avoided passing on the savings in cost. But then when I took the ride, I found myself looking at the HUD, reluctant to peek at the instrument cluster. I guess the instrument cluster being very busy compared to the neat HUD, leads to this. Just having the RPM and speed standout like that without any clutter was helpful.

The manual shifts were quick and the beauty is that it doesn't upshift even as it holds the redline. I think this would come in handy when driving on the hills. I really wish I could take a TD around in a hilly terrain because that will test the AGS and highlight its shortcomings even more.

And some previous driver(s) may have driven it incorrectly - long enough for the engine to have suffered some sort of tuning/ tappet adjustment disruption (I am guessing that this can also happen with an engine that has a fuel injection system - just as it does with a carburetted one. I have seen it happen with all our old cars. But I have never owned a vehicle with a fuel injection system, so I have no real knowledge there.) I was doing the TD on a highway-connector - not on an actual highway. And, I was doing it in the late-morning, rather than the mid-afternoon, which I prefer. So, there was quite a bit of traffic, which prevented me from achieving a smooth run at fast speeds. What I was experiencing, therefore, was most probably the 'mid-range lag' - which even the official review mentions explicitly. However, my primary disappointment with the car - between 60 to 90 kmph - was the lack of stability I felt, more than the engine response (which too was disappointing). The car did not feel planted enough, given my expectation based on it's wide wheel-track and added kerb weight. Also, the steering remained just as light as it was at city-speeds, while I would have liked it to weigh-up further at 90 kmph. Quote: Originally Posted by blitz_nomad I'm wondering if this is an engine mainly for the revv happy in the highway, while giving trouble to sedate drivers.

Would love to know your views. I don't know whether my driving style is what is known as 'sedate', or not. My standard highway-speed, on my 1993 M800, is between 90 - 110 kmph. That car, even with it's insignificantly small engine-power, always has enough juice left for a quick overtake - without having to floor the pedal (and very rarely asking for a down-shift). And I am always doing quick overtakes, while driving in super-congested Kolkata (having a very small car helps too). I hate cruising behind sluggish drivers in city traffic. But I will never redline an engine. I am extremely light-footed - I drive with just my toes on the A-pedal. The only time I might have to floor the pedal on my M800 is if I need to do a sudden overtake at speeds above 70-80 kmph, and I don't want to down-shift. IMHO the way a car moves has as much do to with how it's momentum is being handled by the driver, as it does with what kind of power the engine is providing. The other very important factor - in that department - is the Nm/ Kg ratio. And that's where the Ignis gets an advantage. Both cars have the same engine - with a max torque of 113 Nm. But the Ignis is 90 Kgs lighter. And it has very different dynamics too. Which, as I said in my original feedback, suites my driving style better, compared to the new Baleno. Even though I did not get the scope to take the car up to 100 kmph, I did manage to cross 90 a few times. But at that speed, I personally did not find enough feedback from the engine to inspire trust/ hope! Unlike the S-Cross, which I have recently TD'd on the same road, and similarly experienced it's frustrating mid-range lag. But with that car, as soon as I touched 90, I could feel in my gut that just a little more momentum - a gentle nudge on the gas - and it would render. And it does! There's a new found surge of energy once you let the S-Cross 1.4 lt engine glide smoothly beyond 90 kmph, without pushing it. I did not feel that the Baleno had such a pleasant surprise waiting around the corner! But then, to be fair, the car did not get the scope to prove me wrong. That lack of 'surprise' is what prompted me to 'yearn' for the 1.4 lt K series - on this otherwise-yummy Baleno! However, since you mention that you are - Quote: a sedate driver (generally at 80 kmph in highways), light footed, I shy away from revving the engine - And if you enjoy the car during a TD... I would say you should go for it! As I mentioned in my feedback earlier, even though the powertrain/ response of the car was not really my cup of tea - I totally love everything else about it!", 21st March 2022,maruti-baleno,Kolkata,52,188,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

Hence if I were you, I would either buy the manual Baleno, or else wait for the Brezza. I test drove the AMT again - this time to my hearts content. For me Auto gearbox is not negotiable. A few points that I observed - - The jerk in the shift is maximum when shifting from 1st to 2nd. Irrespective of whether you are shifting using M function or letting the AMT do it automatically. - The shifts from 3rd to 4th to 5th if done manually feel very less intrusive than if they are done automatically by the AMT. Also these shifts are far less jerky than the shift from 1st to 2nd. - If you take off the foot from the accelerator to let the AMT shift the gear when you want it to, the jerk is noticeably reduced. We would do this even in the CVT for easy shifting and not extending the RPM. So if one learns to do the same thing here, AMT is more livable with. - Spirited driving should be undertaken using manual mode only and it is more satisfying. I've decided to push through the purchase. If Brezza comes in an irresistible format then I will be in a soup. For now the only hurdle left is to choose the color. Having already owned (currently) the White Baleno I thought I'd probably shift to the Silver for a change but I am not so sure yet as white still looks the best IMO. Will go and have a look at the silver which I find a tad too bluish to my liking.

I have owned the Micra CVT and Honda City CVT and if you take your foot off the accelerator you would be actually going nowhere. If you try this while overtaking, you are a dead duck.Smooth CVT progression is achieved by modulating the pedal but that doesn't mean you can take your foot off it at any time.

I have the same feeling about Hyundai/Kia. In reality, I just don't like them, how they look, how they drive and even their campaigns and the way they strategise their new products. Carens is a fine family car but I don't have a big family, I'm unmarried and I live with my parents and now, we have 3 hatchbacks, a TDCi 1.0 Beat (2013), a 1.3 Multijet Punto Evo(2015) and now the petrol Baleno. Regarding The Cooler incident, I have a very bitter feeling about us Indians that most of us think whatever they own are theirs and property of others/public can be loitered if it makes first person's belongings better. I'm still pissed that my neighbour didn't informed me that he dinged my 4 day old car before I even drive it 100kms. Forgetting the past, my neighbour paid me Rs 8.5k in cash. My insurer is New India Insurance, gross NCB post this year won't be more than 2k. I've decided to go with insurance and repairs from dealer workshop. I'm paying 1k filing charge. Service manager prioritised that I should get a new door and I agreed, why? The dent on the window frame near A pillar will be difficult to repair. Door is around 7k. The Nexa shop guaranteed me that they will replace the front door again for free if they can't match the exact color(or they'll do the PDR on old door if I'm not satisfied with the new one). My service agent also told me that one thing people don't take in context that the car's color fades, even a 6 month old car's color will be different from a new one out of dealership. He said that since my paint is a few days old, it has gone zero deterioration. So the paint will match. I'll take that with a grain of salt but will go with a new door and see how it comes out.

Regarding The Cooler incident, I have a very bitter feeling about us Indians that most of us think whatever they own are theirs and property of others/public can be loitered if it makes first person's belongings better. I'm still pissed that my neighbour didn't informed me that he dinged my 4 day old car before I even drive it 100kms. Forgetting the past, my neighbour paid me Rs 8.5k in cash. My insurer is New India Insurance, gross NCB post this year won't be more than 2k. I've decided to go with insurance and repairs from dealer workshop. I'm paying 1k filing charge. Service manager prioritised that I should get a new door and I agreed, why? The dent on the window frame near A pillar will be difficult to repair. Door is around 7k. The Nexa shop guaranteed me that they will replace the front door again for free if they can't match the exact color(or they'll do the PDR on old door if I'm not satisfied with the new one). My service agent also told me that one thing people don't take in context that the car's color fades, even a 6 month old car's color will be different from a new one out of dealership. He said that since my paint is a few days old, it has gone zero deterioration. So the paint will match. I'll take that with a grain of salt but will go with a new door and see how it comes out. Waiting period is long, minimum 7 days. They don't have the rear view mirror in stock. I'm very enthusiastic about receiving advice from pro Bhpians. Thank you all That's great to know. Just ensure that they torque every single bolt and but on that door or mirror to the Factory Service Manual Spec. They often tend to overlook that to speed up everything and take it lightly saying that they do it everyday. But torque spec is torque spec and never ever take it for granted. Get every single screw torqued down since your going with a door replacement. Also, tell them to use tack cloths in between coats to prevent foreign particles ruining the paint job and don't let them bake the paint outside the paint booth. That will contaminate for sure.

For the same reason, while getting my XL6, I opted for Magma Grey despite loving Silver, since darker shades are a lot less forgiving to such mistakes. My 800's Metallic California Gold is a royal pain to match. The kind of mismatch you had, is very common on lighter shades. This is Dr. Naren's SX4 post repair, notice the mismatch.

Till I came to the part which said that CVT is gone and AMT it is going to be. Ouch! That hurt. Before coming to a conclusion, I suggest you watch Evo India's Baleno AMT video, which shows its shift quality and refinement. That clip confirms how much Maruti improved their Amt over these years. Previously, the AMT would be a little jerky on downshifts, but it has been smoothened out by automatically blipping the throttle before shifting. Possibly, the best AMT-equipped car currently available in the country along with the Swift. I was never a fan of CVT's due to their rubber band effect. The moment you try to overtake someone or drive aggressively it will show its weakness and feels too disconnected from the drive. Whereas, Amt behaves more natural to the throttle inputs. CVT's are only good in the city while staying at low rpm and in constant throttle. In short, it is better suited for those who are not interested in driving and for sedate drivers. I will any day prefer ""Maruti"" Amt over CVT. Amt's has no such problems, it feels like a manual but with a slight head node while upshifts and has better control over CVT's due to its manual mode. Also, Amt's are way more efficient than CVT's. IMO, It's not a downgrade. Technically yes, but practically not. Note, I am referring here about ""Maruti Amt"" only, not all Amt's are the same.

I loved the fact that one can shift to manual mode while overtaking with just a push to the left. That way, overtaking was much better than the archaic torque converter I drive.

142, Leoshashi , 23:08 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Took a long TD of the New Baleno last week since a relative needs a sub 4m city runabout, and here are my observations in short: What I loved: -Looks really sharp. -Liked the way suspension has come out to be, far more compliant than older Baleno. No one will ever complain with this setup. My XL6 in comparison is on the stiffer side despite riding on upsized Michelins. -Panels surely shut with a nice heft. It's no VW yet, but doesn't feel tinny like the older Baleno -Interiors felt well screwed together, except random creaks from Headunit area, the cabin in general felt of far better build. -Loved the HUD and it's implementation. -AMT gearbox isn't a dealbreaker anymore. We have owned WagonR and Ignis AMTs in past, and this unit on Baleno feels far more refined. Long term reliability remains a doubt though, given AMT's history. -Steering has been tweaked to give returnability. -Interiors look much better than the older Baleno, except the Bluish hue. Personally I love what Toyota offers on the Glanza. -Headunit resolution and interface looks brilliant. The Arkamys association surely works. With those basic paper cone speakers, the audio felt better than old Harman unit. What I didn't like -The bluish finish looks really bad if it isn't clean. The TD car had oily marks and it was an eyesore. -360 degree camera implementation looks crude. Not sure if it was the resolution on offer or calibration. -Didn't like the useless taillight extension on the boot. -Seats, while better on support, felt a bit too soft. Not sure how it would translate on longer journeys. -The gap between top part of Headunit and IRVM is a touch too less for my liking, may become a blindspot for some. What disappointed me: -The K12N engine. 90PS, a 7PS increase is only on paper. This engine excels in traffic, part throttle responses being very nice. But it disappoints big time when you press the throttle and wish to get a quick progress. The older K12 surely felt way eager and revved quicker. Clutch is ultra smooth and light. But the way the engine behaved on empty roads, surely disappointed me. The last gen Baleno RS didn't do well and one reason was that the K12 was competent and wasn't way behind. This new K12N engine is ultra refined and economical, but the eagerness of old K12 is surely gone. Between 2000-4000 RPM, there is a good lag, and it kills all the fun. I had driven this engine in old Glanza but it had the mild hybrid assistance and thus it didn't feel this dead. Don't get me wrong, the engine is still one of the best 1.2 NA units around, but this has moved to being a more commuter grade engine, if I may say so.

It will always be a nagging worry to park in neutral with just the handbrake holding it back from rolling, especially outside my regular apartment parking slot. And I read earlier in this forum that turning off the car while in gear somehow is not the equivalent of parking a manual car in gear and is not preventing it from rolling, which is surprising and worrying.

This is the top model premium hatch. This is not done really. The horn switch which obviously is in the center is too far for the thumb to reach and mind you I got big hands. There are plethora of empty switches on the steering wheel which by itself is an eyesore but why couldn't they use one of those nearest switches towards the edge as an additional horn button. The infotainment system is very elaborate and confusing. With so many menus and sub menus it is just too chaotic. Reading the infotainment booklet that comes with it by itself is a task and one can't figure out how to fix or change things sometimes. For eg. when I connect the system with bluetooth on my phone and stream the music to the car, if I get a call in between the music keeps playing and the caller also can be heard. I mean why the music does not pause automatically? I tried addressing this with the SA and they have no clue either how to fix it. No handrest in the back. A glaring omission. Why couldn't they just build it in the seats like everyone does? Apart from cutting down the cost I don't see any reason why else. No leather or artificial leather seats in the top model Alpha. Just plain fabric seats which is totally unacceptable for a car that costs 11 lacs plus on road. I had to spend another 10k for the seat covers which by itself were hard to find due to the inbuilt airbags in the seats. Nexa people said that the ones I installed may not be air bag friendly but Auto Form or Foam where I got them from they say they are compliant as they have this thinner fabric type thing on the sides where airbags will reveal themselves if they are deployed. Artificial leather on steering wheel - The only place Maruti put some leather like thing is on the steering wheel and there too they cheapened it out by using man made material. The material is not as smooth and soft as leather. It feels hard and rough. The IRVM placement has the same issue as the previous gen Baleno - it is placed too far down the windshield which blocks the view of the front - it almost feels like that there are 2 separate windshields - one for the driver and one for the passenger with a blind spot in between. I am quite shocked how can Maruti not notice this design fault for 8 years and when they had a chance to fix it they clearly avoided it. The reverse camera's quality is not what it should be. It is pixelated and should have been of a slightly higher resolution. The 360 cam is still ok but when you are reversing what you see on the screen is not clear and leaves you guessing. Another victim to the cost cutting I am assuming. They want features for marketing but they don't really look much into the user experience aspect of it. One can argue that it is a Maruti so one cannot expect luxury or better than average experience but then this is the premium hatch and the top model. If they sell something touting it is a a premium hatch, they ought to look at the user experience element of it as well. The mileage I am getting is 13.5 in the city with AC on. Needs some wait before I conclude on that as I have merely done 400kms so far. The AC is meh - not quite as good as my 2017 previous model swift which chills like anything. Can't complain that it is lacking but when you compare it with the previous Swift, then you can tell. Now the good part - The suspension is tuned for comfort - It soaks bumps much better than the previous model it replaces (I still own that too). The AGS AMT is not a bummer. Anyone not wanting to buy this car due to an AMT needs to rethink. I too was apprehensive but after driving it it turned out to be more satisfying that I thought it would be. The manual shift in the AGS is awesome and lets you do all the fun things you can do with a regular manual. Any flooring of the accelerator has to be two step process as one needs to put it in the manual mode for a kickdown or else the AMT will fumble and struggle. The lag in the manual shift is not there. It is just not there. Shifts are prompt. The AGS shifts can be laggy and jerky if you dont ease the accelerator. I let off the accelerator when I want it to shift and it does the job perfectly. However the tuning of the 3rd and the 4th gear in the auto shift is such that when you let off the gas for a shift from the 2nd to the 3rd and the shift happens, almost instantly the next shift from the 3rd to the 4th happens leaving a little jerk. The spacing between the 3rd and the 4th is too close. The HUD is convenient in a way as you are always aware what speeds you are doing. Beyond that the RPM and the real time mileage you are getting that it shows, is redundant for me. On the contrary if they add the gps directions to it, that can be useful but I don't think that will happen. This system looks very basic to me, unable to handle that sort of input. Boot space is excellent and so is the leg room. For anyone who knows Baleno they know what I am talking about. It defies physics in a way that one cannot imagine the kind of legroom one gets in this smallish hatchback. Dashboard layout is quite modern and smart - Unmaruti like - they have improved this tremendously.", 14th June 2022,maruti-baleno,Chandigarh,185,305,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive
225, Darth_vater , 19:35 ,Newbie,"So I had decided on picking up the new Baleno Alpha MT (Celestial Blue). I even gave the booking amount but now I'm having second guesses for the following reasons: - Stability at higher speeds. I am concerned whether the car is planted at 120km/hr. I do a lot of trips with friends and sometimes we do push the car at 120 (max). I am concerned on its stability at this speed. -Wireless Android Auto / Carplay - I am surprised this is not available initially. Many have mentioned it will arrive in the OTA update though I am not sure if it ever will. -Drive - I have read multiple people suggesting it feels a bit sluggish. I was okay when I drove it but as I said, I do drive a lot on highways too so it shouldn't be too sluggish while overtaking. -Safety - Multiple people have given assurances that is more safe than the outgoing car. Still not sure about its safety. Now for the alternative, firstly I am looking at the new Brezza and check if there is a variant suitable for me when it launches on June 30th. I am not hopeful as there will be a premium pricing over the outgoing model. Budget is 11 but I can still push 12L (max - all inclusive). Assuming Brezza is a no go, any suggestions on other car options? I will list down the reasons of why I have not considered the following cars. Its not final, feel free to change my view on these cars, I am open to suggestions New Hyundai Venue - In my budget of 11 - 12 Lakhs, I can only pick up the 82bhp variant. My brother has the new i20 and I am not happy with the engine. Its good for i20 but not a bigger car like Venue; Altroz - At my budget, I could go for XZ Plus turbo. My concerns on this car is that compared to i20 and Baleno, it feels a bit outdated and also its NVH levels, Bad Pre and post sales services, okay-ish interiors. I spoke to multiple owners and they all complained about the clutch having issues and also car having problem ascending hilly regions. Not sure if they were being honest on this. i20 - Brother owns this car, not sure if I'm alright in picking up another i20 for home. Will skip this. Glanza - Basically everything the same Baleno. Hated the interiors on Glanza, looked like an Etios cab interiors in my eyes. Still felt baleno looks way better than the Glanza. Nexon - For the features I want, car is way out of my budget. Kiger - Initially liked the manual turbo (top-end). However, I read many reports and getting very mileage, poor interiors, NVH being high. Sonet - The engine trim and features I need are out of budget. Also felt the back seating cramped. Nissan Magnite - A friend has it. Packed with features but I just didn't like the car and I am also not sure about Nissan services and their future in India. Tata Punch - I did not like how it looks from behind. Interiors felt okay and I didn't like the drive of this car when I TD. Citroen C3, Triber - Will be skipping all these for various reasons which I won't get into detail. Bottom line I need to make a decision and go with it.", 20th June 2022,maruti-baleno,Bangalore,4,5,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

Wireless Android auto like you said isn't there and the hearsay is that it will come with OTA. I won't get my hopes up for that. The wired Android auto keeps getting disconnected and I've used multiple cables . Even ordered some new ones.. My SA says he will get it throughly checked during service. Engine is sluggish no doubt. The manual is still a bit better but it lacks the punch. Safety is a grey area right now as no Ncap tests have been conducted. It is likely to be better than the previous gen but how much it's anybody's guess. The Brezza with a slightly higher budget would be a better vehicle overall.

The sluggish feeling is only shown in the automatic or is it noticeable in the manual as well. The TD car I took was badly maintained and hence cannot trust that. I have just had about 20 days with my Zeta AGS and all of 1400 kms on the ODO. This included a 600+ km small round-trip to a nearby tourist spot. Before i proceed to give my opinions on the car, please appreciate that I have never had any automatic cars before and neither have we had very quick/agile cars in our garage. I enjoy driving when I am not rushing. Office commutes(city drives) - This is why the Baleno AGS has been purchased in the first place. A 60km daily commute in peak work hours amidst maddening and unruly traffic. So, ease of use, comfort and fuel economy were the only parameters considered. Infact, we upgraded our booking from an Ignis Alpha AGS. The Baleno replaces our 8 year old and 1.13L kms run Figo TDCi as our daily driver. The Figo has been designated to a more relaxed life now. During the wait from booking to delivery, my TUV300 was put to use for daily commutes. It is otherwise earmarked for our road-trips only. Now, in a nutshell, the Baleno is sheer pleasure in city traffic. Yes, it is a bit slow to roll from a standstill compared to my torquey diesels, but for most of the commute the sheer ease and comfort it provides is nothing short of pampering. The cabin is well insulated and the car is extremely refined. With most of your work off-loaded to some electro-mechanical wizardry, which is not jerky at city speeds at all, I absolutely do not feel tired or irked at the day end now. The cabin also has this strange feel good factor to it. It is also returning in the range of 15-16 kmpl for city commutes which is as per my expectation from this bulky hatchback. The suspension is also superbly tuned. I call it the ""comfortable yet not compromised"" tune. My dad disagrees, he says our Etios sedan is more comfortable, the Baleno is a close second. As a fellow BHPian friend told me few months back, there is a learning curve for driving all types of automatics. I am getting a hang of it, quicker than I thought. Highway and village roads - Honestly, I was not expecting much from the Baleno on the highways. But it has so far, far exceeded my expectations on most parameters. It is super stable in straight lines and you can actually chuck it once in a while onto the next lane. It won't complain or make you mumble to yourself - don't do it again. I drove mostly between 80-100 kmph on the toll roads and between 60-80 kmph on the State highways and village roads. At those speeds, you feel cocooned nicely and the brilliant suspension tune does not make you nervous for once.The only thing that would bother you would be the tyre noise seeping in the otherwise absolutely calm and quiet cabin. Braking is quick and precise. If you get bored and floor the A pedal, you are greeted with a throaty growl and 6k rpm up-shifts. In 3rd gear, 100 kmph comes up quite effortlessly. I wanted to hear the alarm buzzing for 120 kmph, so I floored it and got there in 3rd gear itself. Again, no drama getting there or stopping afterwards. I am yet to use the M mode. But, in certain situations, like you change lanes to overtake a truck while in 5th gear at 70-80 kmph and tap the A pedal that little bit harder, the car shifts down to 4th and there is a momentary lull in delivery of power. Would get you to think, you could have completed the overtake without the downshift. This caused some discomfort for few times till I learnt to live with it or deal with it. Even at times, you are cruising at 70 kmph in 5th and going up a very slight incline the car would, for some reason which I am yet to figure out, shift a gear down. That said, the shifts are actually smoother and quicker than many drivers I have come across. Off-course, it is noticeable for say 1st to 2nd and 5th to 4th. But unless you are keenly looking for it, you will miss most of the shifts, the passengers, even more so. Did I mention, the suspension is super silent? Ok, next up. Ample ground clearance. Coming from the TUV, I started very apprehensively. Specially those lorry spec bumps on the village roads. No issues for the Baleno at all. And if you want to leisurely cruise on the highways at 80-90 kmph all day, you will be greeted with magical figures of fuel consumption on the MID. BHPian Dip27in who accompanied us on the trip remarked - it is actually sucking fuel from cars around it. Finally, yes, I do feel the Baleno is overpriced. But so are all cars these days. But it sure is a nice, comfortable and premium hatch to drive or be driven in.

The only necessary accessories one needs are - Mud Flaps Floor Mats (Rubber) Boot Mat (Rubber) As for adding safety - I don't think there is any accessory that is offered that will enhance the safety in the Alpha. Everything else is subjective and will depend upon how much you want to spend as most other accessories will enhance aesthetics.

Do have a look at GFX rubber Floor mats as they are much better than the Nexa original mats. The fit is amazing and have raised edges ( I think that's why these are called 3D mats). Underbody coating - I personally don't think the modern cars needs any additional treatment as rust is not an issue for 10-15 years. Vinyl Flooring - this again is a personal choice.

263, jessie007 , 14:02 ,BHPian,"I'm in the same boat, but w.r.t. to base variants - to be driven mostly in Delhi NCR. Considered Baleno and i20, and no other. Altroz would have been my blind pick, if only it had a four cylinder petrol engine. In the same price band, i would prefer to go for a four cylinder, versus a three. Test drove both Baleno and i20, but must say that the overall experience with i20 was better and impressive. Drive was smooth, clutch light and i particularly liked the malai gearshift. Just for information, I'm replacing my diesel 75HP Punto which i had to sell after 9 years due to NGT diktat in Delhi. Coming back, I'm looking at the base variants only - and i20 ticks all the boxes. 1.2 NA petrol is not exciting, but i felt it was alright. Heard lot of stories about it being inadequate in the older version though. I'm not a fancy feature person, so no touchscreen is a good thing if one is looking to keep a car for more than five years. We replace our touchscreen phones in two years or so, don't really know how much abuse can these touchscreens infotainment systems in cars handle - long term usability and reliability is still a question mark. Having said that, I'm not averse to modern tech, just that i feel it needs a bit more time to prove its long term reliability. I compared Baleno's base Sigma and next Delta variant with i20s Magna, which is priced between the two Baleno variants. Feature-wise, the i20 offers all the necessary features, plus music system with 4 speakers, steering mounted audio controls, electric adjust ORVM, rear AC vents, front armrest, cooled glovebox. Plus has a larger wheelbase than the Baleno. Though space is comparable, and there is not much difference between the two. But the boot, though adequate, is smaller than the Baleno's. Both i believe share the same tyre size 185/65 R15, which again is sufficient for city drive and the odd highway run. Baleno's Sigma variant doesn't have a music system, which is a miss - aftermarket one can get a bit bigger touch screen - but don't really know how good will it be in terms of fit, finish and relaibity - plus issue of electrical warranty. Having said that, automatic climate control and rear defogger are standard from base variant, which is great. Baleno's Delta variant on the other hand offers a touchscreen music system, but i don't really like the thick black frame surrounding it. Body panels of the Baleno felt good, definitely a lot better than the previous version. Hyundai on the other hand has reduced i20s weight (perhpas the reason why the 1.2 felt adequate), but i felt the build quality was decent. Both are nowhere near Altroz's build quality and 5 star safety rating. So it is not an easy decision. I'm leaning towards the i20, but haven't counted out the Baleno yet. A 4 or 5 star safety rating might tip the scales in favour of the Baleno.", 14th July 2022,maruti-baleno,New,782,"1,496",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

I echo your views, regarding Hyundai's petrol engines not being fuel efficient. Also their power ratings are somewhat deceptive. Remember driving approx 92 BHP Accent years back and it never felt like having the quoted power. Still feel that the Santro is their best vehicle till date in terms of drivability, fuel efficiency and pricing (even build quality was decent) But Hyundai's petrol engines are amongst the best in refinement and NVH levels are almost always low even without any under bonnet cladding. Regarding the new Baleno versus new i20 - an interesting thing has happened. Maruti has added some structural reinforcements in the Baleno, thereby increasing its weight by around 65 kgs. This increase in weight will definitely penalize fuel efficiency. Maruti's petrol engines are no doubt fuel efficient, but low vehicle weight had a significant role to play in giving higher mileage. On the other hand, Hyundai has reduced the weight of the i20 (by around 80 kgs) to most probably help increase fuel economy. Hopefully they haven't compromised on the safety front, and used more high strength steel. So it will be interesting to see how much the gap has reduced.

I have owned, Maruti 800, Omni, Balero, Ford Endeavor old model and Innova. Still have an old Alto from 2009. All cars owned were bought for practical reasons. Which has to suit family and work. Currently driving Baleno 2022 Alpha AGS since April. It is a good car and stable on highways as well. It has done nearly 6000 Kms. Baleno 2022 is not a peppy car, it is well balanced for city and highway driving. I did a Bangalore to Pune and return drive. It performed very well. Pros: 1. Space 2. New Features 3. Good AC 4. Cruise control does a good job 5. Good Average - Highway 22 to 25 Kmpl. City- 15-16 6. Good Pickup as well. 7. HUD - good to use on highways. 8. Stable at 120+ kmph 9. Perfect for Bengaluru Traffic. Cons: 1. Average music system 2. Below the hood, cables are visible everywhere- feast for rats. 3. Steering Wheel - room for improvement 4. Apollo Tyres - are noisy.

Hi, 1) The celerio amt was launched in India in 2014 which if I am right is the first amt from Maruti. Its yet to complete 10 year period. So 10 year long term reliability is not yet proven. However multiple expert reviews in this forum have stated that the current generation Baleno ags is vastly improved from the first gen celerio amt from Maruti. 2) Being an alpha ags owner currently driving in hectic Mumbai traffic, here is my experience: a) It does the city run about pretty decently provided the throttle input is gentle. b) Ive driven with 5 people and a kid and there was no power lag felt in the city runaround. c) However, Ive observed clutch slipping ( transmission overheat alarm) two times in a moderate hilly terrain after a ride of around 40-45 minutes in bumper to bumper traffic. Im yet to understand the reason for the same ie if its because of me pushing the A pedal too much than needed. d) I havent done any long highway trips to comment on its highway capabilities. Hope this helps.", 13th October 2022,maruti-baleno,Mumbai,25,16,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

323, Ram35 , 06:21 ,Newbie,"Hi I am driving an Baleno AGS AMT, took delivery in April 2022. Looks great, interior is good. Space is a big advantage. I bought this as, Bangalore Traffic situation is worse now, AMT is good for city ride. 360 degree Camera helps a lot in city. I have done few highway as well, but it is tiring on highways as the pickup is not same as 100% Automatic. But, fuel economy on highway is great. I have got 24+ kilometers. Best was 27+ Kms on one of the trips. As of today car has done 11750+ kilometers, challanges I face are: 1. Auto on Off system curse in B2B traffic- Switch off auto on off in bumper to bumper traffic. There is less stress on engine. 2. AC is poor - Always park car in shade- AC takes lot of time to cool. 3. HUD - use it only in long rides - it is of no use in city drive. 4. PICKUP: It is not an issue in the city, manages well. Major issue after third service: Bumpy ride - Now after 3rd service, vehicle is not stable, even on small pothole vehicle is bumpy- planning to take it for detailed check up. Suzuki Service is bad now, they are not able to manage the volume at service centers. New vehicles are pushed out without proper check. Siggestion: All those who are buying a new car, please test drive all the available cars in your budget. Sometimes this may help in getting the right vehicle.

In traffic it is easy to drive as there is no clutch, but mileage is between 15 and 17 KMPL. Banglore traffic, the average speed is 12 to 13 KMPH, car is always in 2nd gear. Highways - it is good for short distances only, max 300 KMS. Overtaking has to be planned. But the mileage is great 24+ KMPL in car dispaly. I have done 600 kms in 31.5 Ltrs, with two adult and one child. Manul overide, mileage drops by 20%. Depends on one's driving style. It is a good city car with lot of space. 4 adults +1 kid. Breaking at high speed, one has to be cautious. I have not done above 120, it takes time to reach to 120. Good stability and under control, between 80-100 KMPH speed.

Personally, I don't like any GPS Navigation that is not guided by Google Maps. They are nowhere near as comprehensive and up to date as Google Maps. So the fact that even the Alpha head unit does not offer any native navigation is not a miss. It is capable of displaying Google Maps with wired USB connection with the Android phone. So anyone wanting navigation has google maps accessibility on the screen as long as the plug in their phones to the unit. As for atrocity, I agree with you that Maruti has been very Maruti like even when offering the top end variant of their premium hatch. The following is a small list of glaring omissions that I observed are missing from the top end Alpha variant which I feel should have been standard. - Sunglasses holder - Wiper speed delay control (they had this in the last generation but deleted it this time) - Wireless Android Auto - LED dome lights (they are still using the dim halogen bulbs) - Height adjustable seat belts (they had this in the last generation but deleted it this time) - Leather wrapped steering wheel (they use some artificial material instead) - Wireless charging - Leather seats - Rear arm rest - TPMS", 1st November 2022,maruti-baleno,Chandigarh,185,305,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Negative

You can update the unit by two methods. One is using the Smartplay Pro Sync app another is by using a USB device which is a bit more involved and requires a laptop/PC. Both methods are well explained in this video. https://youtu.be/7LZof2IK0JI I've updated mine using the USB drive method. For which first you have to find out the infotainment model by following the instructions from here (for baleno the model name is 55TA). Next you can download the update file by following the instructions from the page (Go to the download page link). The USB device must be formatted first and should be 8GB atleast. The downloaded update file is a zip file and it contains a file called upgrade.pkg copy this file to the USB. (I had to create two additional empty text file using notepad called upgrade.bin and upgrade.json and copy it to USB without it the unit didn't recognise the update).

406, no_boundaries , 22:39 ,BHPian,"We welcomed the 2023 Baleno Alpha AGS 3 weeks ago. Sharing my initial impressions, coming from 2017 Celerio AGS I like - 1. Engine has become very silent and responsive to throttle inputs 2. It takes at least 100kms of driving for gearbox to tune to driver's driving style. Now the gear shifts right when I want it to 3. Seats are so comfortable, all controls just falls in your access 4. AC chills well even under blazing sun, typical of a Maruti. 5. Car feels stable in a straight line and well built What I'm trying to cope with - 1. AGS is better than the 1st gen AGS, it still requires the driver's conscious effort to moderate acceleration inputs. If a new driver adapting to this gearbox is not careful about this, they could prematurely ruin the gearbox, as my dad did with the celerio 2. Suspension is soft such that you feel the car move more than the tyres turn on road 3. Seat fabric could have been softer to touch 4. Audio is still poorly tuned. Would have loved some more tuning and differentiation between low, mid and high frequency distribution 5. Rear visibility is poor through the rear windshield as it slopes limiting a clear view 6. I still can't rely on the 360 camera as the image is very poor to accurately gauge a tight spot. My wife makes fun of me when I try to ignore the camera and look around from the car Overall, if you fall in love with a car for simple basic things it does, it's easy to overlook the other shortcomings.", 24th March 2023,maruti-baleno,Bangalore,221,201,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

I have driven ~14850 KM in the last 5 years. I have observed in the last couple of months a sound when the steering is turned to the right. This can only be observed after driving the car for 5 KM. You can hear this inside the car and not so much from the outside, I gave the car for service yesterday at Kalyani Motors, Bangalore, they said it would most probably be the bush in the steering assembly or the steering rods. Today they say that the steering motor needs to be replaced and will cost 24K. I asked them to complete the service without the replacement. I want a second opinion. Please advise where I can take the car in south Bangalore for a checkup and what do you think is causing this issue.", 25th March 2023,maruti-baleno,Bangalore,161,135,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
409, neil.jericho , 10:08 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"A few days ago, we brought home a new Maruti Baleno AGS Zeta. We went with the Zeta version as it came with 6 air bags (non-negotiable for us). The Alpha variant had features which were nice to have and not necessarily must haves, at least for our usage. The Baleno was a logical upgrade from my Mom's Maruti Ignis, which was a car that I really detested driving, on account of its comically non centering steering. Thankfully, the Baleno doesnt seem to have this problem. With a budget of around Rs 10 L (including the exchange value of the Ignis), there were 2 cars which I had shortlisted - the new Maruti Baleno AGS and the Hyundai Grand i10 Nios. IIRC we were comparing the mid variant of the Baleno, with the top end variant of the Grand i10 Nios. Between the two, the interiors of the Baleno felt significantly more premium, though my Mom preferred the compact size of the Grand i10 Nios. The Hyundai was cheaper by around Rs 50K, as well. Two of the main reasons for sticking with Maruti were the good resale value and peace of mind when it came to service. The Maruti service center is situated very close to my Mom's place of work. The service advisors come and collect the car keys, get the vehicle serviced and return the keys, without any fuss. Prior to the Ignis, my Mom owned a Hyundai i10. Every visit to the Hyundai SVC involved a prolonged battle with the service advisor to knock off all the unnecessary items that were sqeezed into the inflated bills. Dr Crazy_Driver's mammoth thread (Hyundai India - The occasional serious quality lapse and apathetic manufacturer response!) on Hyundai also played a key role in swaying our decision towards the Baleno. That said, the ""supposedly premium"" Nexa sales experience nearly pushed us to cancel our booking and go with the Grand i10 Nios, instead. The irony is that both dealerships are under the Popular group, but they couldnt be more different from each other. One is a well run, professional setup. The other is staffed with amateurs, barring one gentleman. Popular Hyundai sales experience On my first visit to the showroom, I was promptly attended to by an executive, who also offered me some refreshments. She took my details down, as well. I was quickly assigned a sales executive, who suggested the Grand i10 Nios or the i20. After a thorough walkthrough of both cars, he immediately arranged for a demo car to take me to their stockyard to see the different colours that were available. The sales executive also followed up frequently to arrange the test drive for my parents. The only sour point with the Hyundai sales experience was the abysmal resale that they offered for our low run Ignis. Later on, when they got to know what Maruti quoted, they tried to match it, as best they could. Overall, this was a very good sales experience. Popular Nexa sales experience On my first visit to the showroom, I was promptly attended to by an executive, who didnt take down my details. The showroom only had one Grand Vitara and 2 Ignis cars. When I asked the sales executive about the Baleno, its variants, colours etc, he told me that I had to go to the stockyard if I wanted to see the car. He didnt bother to take my details or provide any information on the car. I even asked him if he was interested in selling me a car but he wasnt even bothered to feign the effort. After I sent an email to Maruti's customer care, the showroom's sales manager got in touch with me and assigned another sales executive. On the morning of the scheduled test drive at my home, there was no update from him. More than 45 minutes later, without even an apology, he called me to say that he was still in the showroom. A few days later, he was supposed to bring the car to my parents place for a test drive. Instead of calling me to say that the car was not available, despite confirming the appointment several days in advance, he dropped me a brief voice note on Whatsapp. Thankfully, the showroom's sales manager realized that the experience was going rapidly downhill and took time out of his personal schedule, on a Sunday, to bring the car for a test drive. While I was test driving the Baleno, the sales executive had contacted his counterpart at True Value and quoted a ballpark figure of Rs 5.3L for the exchange of our Ignis. When the same True Value executive came to inspect the car, he pointed out one small sensor issue, which we fixed promptly at their SVC. However, despite the issue getting rectified, for some strange reason, he kept lowballing us on the exchange price. After a lot of back and forth, the sales manager came back to us saying that they were taking back their quote of Rs 5.3L and could only offer Rs 5.1L, and that too after so many approvals etc. It was almost as though he had moved heaven and earth to give us Rs 20K less than what they had initially quoted. He was flummoxed when I told him that the Hyundai team had also quoted Rs 5.1L. To compensate for the missing Rs 20K, the sales manager offered to switch the existing Rs 5K loyalty bonus to a Rs 6K accessories bonus. The measely Rs 1K increment was not what we were expecting to get. Though the exchange value fiasco nearly ruined the sales experience, we decided to let it go, as we were happy with the Baleno and wanted the car before April 1st, which is when the state tax was going up. Meanwhile, it was such a chore to get the sales executive to share the correct final breakup of the payment to be made. Either he would forget to add line items or he would add the numbers up incorrectly and so on. This back and forth took several days. After completing the payment formalities (ex-showroom + insurance + accessories etc), we purchased the car insurance from our agent. Till then, we had not brought up the topic of taking insurance with the dealership. I sent across the insurance policy to the sales executive and asked him to close the registration formalities. The next day, I received multiple calls from the sales executive and his manager. The shocked manager claimed that I wasnt allowed to take insurance from outside and that he was going to withdraw the accessories bonus, because he assumed we will take Maruti's insurance. Despite politely reminding him that the topic of insurance was never discussed and that, as a customer, there was no link between the accessories bonus and showroom insurance, he adamantly stuck to his guns. In parallel, my email complaints to Maruti had been redirected to the CRM at the showroom. In all my interactions with the Nexa dealership, this was the only person who was a true professional. Later on, I found out that he had served in the armed forces for a long time. He swiftly addressed all my prior concerns with the sales process, as well as the sales manager's hilarious threat to withdraw all the offers, despite all the payments being made. After the registration and paperwork was done, I received no further communication from the sales executive or his manager to inform me about the delivery date and next steps. They just vanished right into thin air! I had to follow up with the CRM to coordinate the delivery date and time. Delivery experience Though the registration formalities and number plate installation were done a few days before the end of the FY, we took delivery on the 1st of April, for personal reasons. The delivery was scheduled for 4 PM. In the afternoon, the CRM called to inform us that his team had not yet installed the fog lights and that the delivery would be slightly delayed. To his credit, he ensured that it was done ASAP. Finally, we were given a time of 4:30 PM. When we got there, the lady receptionist directed us to the waiting lounge and we were served refreshments. Though no other customers were in the showroom, nobody attended to us for the next 20 minutes. All the executives were chilling out inside a conference room. Neither did our sales executive make an appearance, nor did his manager. As I said, vanished right into thin air! One sales executive came to tell us that our car would take another 15-20 minutes to arrive, when we could see the car parked 15 feet away, in the showroom itself!!! As soon as the CRM arrived, he helped us install the various mobile applications, gifted us a pair of complimentary coffee cups and conducted the key handover. The uninterested sales executives were magnanimous enough to step out of their conference room, if only to clap and take a photograph of the handover. Their expressions were as though they were teenagers being given lectures on old school morality by their strict parents. I have never seen a more uninterested, non-supportive set of showroom executives in my life. Not one of them lifted a finger to facilitate the car delivery. The CRM had to remove all the seat covers and give us a walkthrough of the infotainment system. Im sure none of this is in his job description but it was clear that nobody else in the showroom was going to conduct the car delivery, either. As a token of our thanks, we gifted him a pen. Had it not been for him, I would have still been waiting to hear from my sales executive on when I could take delivery of my car ..... In summary This was a downright embarrassing sales and delivery experience from Popular Nexa. My parents were quite unhappy with the entire experience. There is a basic courtesy which has to be extended to customers, which was certainly lacking from the Popular Nexa team. Barring the excellent CRM, who continuously went above and beyond his line of duty, everyone else in the Nexa chain seems to be treating it as a government job, where the customer has to be grateful to spend Rs 10L to buy a car from them. I really dont know why Hyundai's sales executives have to work hard, when the Nexa showroom which is down the road, helps convert Hyundai's potential leads into actual sales. I really hope that someone from Maruti is aware of how mis-managed the entire pre-sales and delivery process is, in this showroom. I had sent an email to Maruti, asking for their area sales manager to get in touch with me, but that never happened. I can only suggest that Cochin based TBHPians buy their Nexa products from other dealerships. The hours of unnecessary headache, just to upgrade to another car in the Nexa suite, is hard to justify. And finally, the car ... I have to admit, the Baleno certainly feels like its a 2 step upgrade from the Ignis. The interiors are really upmarket! I drove it back to my parents home and though there was a lot of traffic, the return journey was a joy. The engine seems to be nicely mated to the gearbox. The Ignis's gearbox made us feel like we were in a boat, with its constant head bobbing. That isnt the case with the Baleno AGS. Overall, this feels like a premium, well rounded hatchback. I will share my driving experiences with the Baleno, as I get some more time with the car. Its a shame that for a car this nice, the sales experience had to be so rotten ....

432, firingpistonz , 11:57 ,BHPian,"Hi there everyone. I am in the market for our second car, mainly a city car and occasional highway runs. Ignis was our first choice since last year. Spoiled by the launch of Jimny, i got distracted. Now I have come back to my senses and decided need to buy a hatchback and narrowed it down to Ignis and Tiago. Spent hours and many test drives deciding between the two. Loved the road manners of the tiago and its ride quality is unparalleled. But finally decided to go with the Ignis, because : engine+gearbox combo is insanely good, better looking than tiago and peace of mind on owning a Maruti. Now I had decided on going ahead with the booking and visited a Nexa to talk to the SA, and I see a Baleno Delta on the showroom floor. Enquired, and I was shocked with the price difference in Bangalore. Here the Ignis Zeta MT is 8.76L on-road. While Baleno Delta MT is just below 9L. both have around 20K discounts. Now I'm completely confused and I require your expert help. 1) Baleno seems like a significant upgrade, interior and exterior when compared to Ignis. Feels like night and day. 2) Ride quality was better(for me) in the Baleno, felt plusher in bad roads, while Ignis was not so great. 3) Some features are missing in the delta Variant in Baleno compared to the zeta in Ignis and I'm ok with it. 4) The price difference is very less, baffled by the fact that the Ignis has gotten so expensive in less than 6 months. 5) The self centring steering issue is not present in the Baleno, while noticable in Ignis (still not as bad as in Celerio) Request the baleno owners to help me here on the following points 1) Baleno feels much bigger, inside and outside, which will be a better city car amongst the two? If I go with Baleno will it be unmanageable in narrow roads? 2) Will there be a significant change in fuel efficiency between the two? The SA says the Baleno is almost and sometimes more efficient than the Ignis as it has the dualjet engine. Is this true? We already have a crossover and we have problems with its size(narrow roads) and intracity mileage(ours is dismal) . So this car needs to be easily manageable in narrow roads and bumper-to-bumper traffic and should return decent fuel economy, atleast more than 14kmpl within city, otherwise defeats the whole purpose of buying a car. 3) I'm planning NOT to buy extended warranty for either cars, Is this a good idea? Reason being we had three Maruti suzuki cars for around 15 yrs and none of them had any major issues. 3) Should I go ahead with Baleno Delta, because the price difference is almost negligible?

Coming from a Celerio AGS, the AGS on the Baleno is still bad and leaves a lot to desire at highway speeds. The response and feedback to acceleration input is very very slow.

Overall It's a premium city car that I knew very well at the time of purchase and I have no complaints driving it within the city. Hey there, I'm glad that I could be of help with the puddle lamps. I believe the reluctancy from the bimal service center workers is because Maruti Suzuki decided to remove the entire wiring for the puddle lamps. Which means they'll have to take apart both the front door panels and connect wires from the central roof lamp to the door (because the puddle lamps have to be synchronised to work in such a way that they turn on only when the doors are open. Someone in this forum has installed puddle lamps in their brezza on their own, you can look it up to get a better idea of how the wiring is done.) Another reason for the reluctancy is probably because your car is still under free service period, so they're being reluctant to get any extra work done on it. Slightly OT but I had similar experience at Kalyani service center, those guys didn't even bother to wash the car properly despite me leaving the car there for an entire day, it had oily hand stains and soap residues everywhere. Only after complaining to their service center owner we were able to resolve the issue and they also said they could install the puddle lamps when we brought the car in for the next service. I'll let you know the status when it does happen, do let me know if the people at suraksha are more helpful with this. Regarding the AC not being able to cool fast enough, i think turning off recirculated air for a few minutes and keeping the AC running with windows open helps remove the hot air inside the car faster. After a minute or two, you can close all the windows and put the AC in recirculated mode again if you like, i tried this trick today and it cooled down the car much faster than it normally does.", 10th May 2023,maruti-baleno,Bangalore,13,17,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

One gripe I find with Maruti AGS is that it's not able to fully utilise that gem of a 1.2 motor. Are the latest iterations any better? One thing that I have learnt over the years exchanging my old cars is to keep selling and buying experiences separate.

Here is how I felt about the car : The engine is absolutely silent , smooth and engaging. Just love the grunt from the K12 engines The gearbox has a sleek shifting , never did i miss shift or had issues with shifting. Not the smoothest ones like those of Hyundai's. But definitely better than the Tata's. Managed to get a range of approximately 700kms with full tank ( 37L). The driving was not sedate. Cruising at 90-100 should definitely return better figures. Overtaking with 3 people and luggage onboard was a breeze. However this engine is more tuned for efficiency. The old generation engine was more brisk and quick. Comfort was really good. Im 6ft tall and had no problems with the driving position. The seats could have been a bit harder. The softer seat makes it uncomfortable for long drives.The dead pedal somewhat feels oddly placed. As I always struggled getting my foot off it with shoes on. Had no issues with the infotainment system. No restarts or lags. It was smoooooth as butter !! The Smartplay Pro and Pro+ systems on the new Maruti cars are reallyy good in terms of UI smoothness and usability. The music was okay. Neither was it too good nor too bad. I had my doubts on the steering response as the old maruti steering had no life in it. Surprisingly the new unit weighed up pretty good at high speeds. It is nowhere close to Tata or the Germans. But atleast it has some life in it !! I love watching that analog cluster and the needle going up !! . Hate these new age digital clusters which looks no less than a cartoon. Things which could have been better ?The stock apollo tyres carry a bit of noise inside the cabin. The alpha variant gets UV cut glass , which helps A LOTTTT in these scorching summers. Maruti should atleast provide this on the Zeta variants !! Can we get these retro fitted in Zeta at MASS ? If yes any idea how much it would cost ? Even though the interiors are new , I still like the beige treatment on the glanza more !! ODO : 3317 Roundtrip : 1377 kms Overall its a fun to drive machine with good comfort and fuel efficiency.

What put me off the idea was that one has to drop the roof lining from the boot side to get their hands inside to free up the wiring etc that is attached to the original antennae. Also if the seal is not good at the base of the shark fin, water will trickle down causing rust issues on the roof. The roof lining is as such of such poor quality, I didn't want to meddle with it.

Maybe problem with specific test car also hyundai amt's and auto's are thirsty and is proven time and again considering city drive so ruled out. 3.

The insurance quoted by them is very high. Ideally, it should not be more than 35-36k including all bells & whistles (Return to Invoice, Engine Protection, Bumper-to-bumber etc). Tell the sales person that you will purchase your insurance from outside (Coverfox, Policy Bazaar or directly from ICICI, Tata AIG etc will save you at least 15k). Also, this so-called 'Essential Accessory' at 30k is very very expensive & it is ABSOLUTELY not required for you to purchase the vehicle. Tell your salesperson you don't need it. If he insists, contact Maruti Suzuki directly and complain. The dealership will come in line. Looking at all the extra they are trying to hoist on you, I would advice you to stay away from this dealership. They don't seem to be honest at all. They CAN NOT insist that you buy insurance or accessories from them.

476, George Thomas , 13:07 ,Newbie,"Since my wife took a driving license we been on the lookout for a car for around 10 lakhs. We have a Honda City (Manual) which for some reason she finds difficult to drive even though she learned to drive and took her license on a manual. Long story short, after a lot of negotiations, where I compromised, she agreed to drive on a regular basics if it was a small vehicle which was an automatic. I am six footer and by the look of things, it looks like both my boys will be close to my height. So it was essential to buy the spacious car possible, while keeping it close to our budget. After the initial search based on suggestions from friends and our own needs, we narrowed it down to the Hyundai i20, and Suzuki Baleno. We took our respective test-drives and these are some of the conclusions we came to. i20 . 1 liter Turbo petrol is a gem of an engine and the best of the lot while the 1.2 liter feels under powered . Entertainment system is amazing and the screen very responsive to touch. Sound quality is okay and can be improved upon. . Full black cabin with plastics all around but has a certain feel good appeal to it. . Seat comfort is good both in the front and back with rear seat being wider but lower than Balenos . Suspension setup is on the stiffer side and road imperfections can be felt inside the cabin. . DCT gearbox is seamless between gear changes and its easier to manage in town where there are constant gear changes. . During our test drive, mileage was on the lower side especially for a hatchback and we got 12-13 km/l in mixed conditions. Baleno . The 1.2 naturally aspirated engine produces only 88 bhp, but power is linear and progressive. . The 7 Smart play pro system is basic but does a decent job. The sound from the 6 speakers is about average. . The dark blue and black cabin with silver accents is just that. Hard plastics everywhere just like the i20 but touch points are covered with soft materials. . Fabric covered seats even in the top model but rear seat comfort is better and there is more leg room. . Even on broken roads the car feels more settled and it is due to a softer suspension setup. . The AMT gearbox is the real Achilles heel and the lag between 1st, 2nd and 3rd gears can be felt while accelerating or in a sudden overtaking situation. . Since its a Maruti, mileage is not an issue and I got 16 km/l which seems pretty fair. Point to note on the Baleno. There is a low transmission whine or hum in the Baleno while at low speeds which I pointed to sales person and he said thats typical of a Maruti AMT. Not that I did not believe him but to be sure, I tried out the test cars at two other showrooms and it turns out the sales man is right once a while. When going for any purchase, I remember the famous words till you pay the money, youre king but once you do, they take over. We visited Indus Motors Kochi where the recently launched Jimny was the star attraction. We took another extensive test drive of the Baleno and the amt gearboxs rubber band effect was apparent but other than that it was fine. Since it was Onam season there were quite a few offers and we got a decent discount on the Baleno. With the sale procedures completed, we were promised delivery in three weeks time. We decided to go for the Baleno Zeta Automatic, since it has most of the essential features, like 6 airbags, a 7 infotainment system, alloy wheels, automatic climate control and projector headlamps. What I really missed from the Alpha variant is the UV glass on all windows, and the new 9 system which has fewer bugs but paying over a lakh for it is ridiculous. We opted for the silver color as the Nexa blue was the default choice for most people and wanted a change. I did go for a PDI check up at the Maruti yard when they told me that my allotted car had arrived. I had a look around the outer edges for any scratches or paint imperfections and took some photos of the VIN number, manufacturing date and engine bay. As I was leaving, I noticed something disturbing, since Maruti sells the largest volume of cars every month, the yard is always filled to the brim. Moving cars in and out is always a challenge and sometimes accidents do happen. This time it was a Maruti Brezza which got its edge ever so slightly bruised, and the paint had come off. I am sure they will buff it off. After witnessing this incident, I told the salesman that I wanted the delivery of my car as soon as possible and in the morning. We took delivery in few days and had another check if everything was okay. The delivery process was smooth and with usual Mauti fanfare we drove out with our new Baleno. The only accessories that I have added are the seats covers, the fog lights along with the essential bits from the showroom. I would have liked to go for better seat covers but the airbags in the front seats prevented me from taking a risk outside. I called the 3M office and they gave me the number for their outlet in Kochi. I went for the 5 year under body and silencer coating. The only item remaining is the steering wheel cover. As I am writing this, we have covered 1150 Kms and with the first service over, the car feels smooth and responsive while driving in and out of town. Although when my wife drives, the speedo gets frozen at 40 - 45Kmph (maximum speed). Still I am happy she has taken a liking to the car and has started driving it on a regular basics. We recently visited a Hill station near Thrissur where the Baleno had no problems climbing steep inclines with a full load.Overall we got a reasonable mileage of 17 Km/l which was a pleasant surprise. The return drive was in the night time and Balenos projector headlights were reasonably bright and the drive was comfortable. In my short time with the car, there are a few things to note. Baleno is perfect for regular city use and for short trips. Do not mistake this for a highway cruiser. Mileage is a strong point and with Marutis cost of ownership, it is good second car to have in your garage. Plastic quality inside the cabin is so-so, maybe I am comparing it with a Honda city which is not fair. Maruti claims to have improved safety by stiffening the panels and offering 6 airbags but I would not put that theory to test. My Honda City has been rear ended twice and while we felt a shake in the cabin, there was not that much damage. When the Bharat NCAP results are out we will get a clear picture. I use wireless android auto to play music and it plays well but, there was a problem while using google maps especially in town areas. The display reads ""GPS signal lost"" on the infotainment screen while the mobile displayed it perfectly. This happened on our trip while in and out of Thrissur town many times. When inquired at the service center, the reply was it is better to connect through the USB. Defeats the whole purpose of wireless android auto. Don't know if other users have this problem too.

495, no_boundaries , 23:32 ,BHPian,"ODO@8686KMS Several highway trips and some city trips that took about the same time as the highway trips later, the Baleno has settled well in its element. I get a consistent mileage between 18 to 19kmpl with a mix of city and highway driving. Some Observations since my last update - 1. On a particularly bad patch of city road, my rear right tyre suffered a tear and sadly could not be rescued. I found the apollo alnac 4G on the stock spec however I couldn't source the H speed rating and had to settle for the V speed rating. The wear and tear was not high or uneven hence went with this option that was fortunately economical. 2. Infotainment is not stable. It either randomly mutes out the audio completely or the screen freezes with no response to touch or long pressing the power. I need to get this checked at the 3rd service coming up in December. The version is the latest to the model as per the Suzuki app. 3. LED Lights works well on dry road conditions however on wet surfaces there is no reflection at all. I need to considerably reduce speed on highways when it rains due to this. The halogens worked fabulously under such conditions. 4. AMT gear shifts have settled into my driving rhythm. As I have always stated, these are barely better than the 1st generation and often fumble under circumstances of slight acceleration or incline. On a recent trip to Wayanad, this was very pronounced and I had to toggle to manual gear shift to save the clutch and engine. 5. The seat fabric is really rough to touch. I've spread a soft bed sheet to the rear seat which helps the feel however its an eyesore 6. The engine and gearbox works best if you drive the car to its capability. You can drive fast and long at higher speed however it just doesn't like those pedal stomping gear dropping aggression. I don't think its necessary on any car on our roads, but that's just me. Modifications and Upgrades - None. The car comes with all features that is required and practical. However there are few bits I want to change to personalize - 1. Dashboard Camera - I will be getting the Viofo A129 Pro Dual Dash camera shortly. I was hoping the MASS could help fix this for me 2. Car Detailing - Once the 3rd service is completed and I have a day to spare I want to handover the car to a good detailer for a thorough spic and span. During this process I also want to do a chrome delete from the car 3. Speaker upgrade - I need to do some research on this before I spend money. It needs to be functional and not flamboyant Signing off with a picture from a recent trip to Wayanad - Thoroughly enjoyed the drive with no fatigue", 27th November 2023,maruti-baleno,Bangalore,221,201,Squeaks/Rattles - Water Leaks - Wind/Road Noise,Very Positive

Maruti cars are VfM but they have some peculiar issues. Cabin noise is one of those top issues. It's related to car's overall structure, build. Hence merely a tyre replacement will not help to reduce noise. My Ritz had factory fitted JK which I later on replaced with Goodyear and then Yokohama. The later ones were better in terms of ride & handling, but there was no positive effect on NVH. There is no.point in merely chasing the expensive tyre brands. Get TPMS on your vehicle if its not there, maintain the tyre pressure as recommended by OEM and preferably fill N2. Yokohama and Ceat Secura drive (these are on my i20) are good tyres and worth considering.

The reviewer said that he found the suspension very mature, or enough to drive over a patchy highways without having to slow down. The bumps didn't bother him at all he mentioned. I wanted to know how it compares to the Baleno. He additionally mentioned that the Fronx felt ""noticeably"" heavier and more well built than the Baleno.

500, Gupts007 , 17:35 ,BHPian,"I have proof now that the Front doors of the new Baleno are heavier and are made of different grade of Steel than the rear doors. Since I have the previous version of the Baleno as well and it being an old car now with 1.3 lac kms on the odometer, the doors on that one would fling out when opened. They would not stop and would freely swing and would easily hit the car parked next to it, if not carefully opened. I did some research and found out that the culprit is the Door Stop like this here Old Baleno Front Door Stop New Baleno Front Door Stop So I went an ordered these for both the front and rear doors. While I was at it, I realized that the Front Stop is different for the new Baleno compared to the pre facelift version. Whilst the rear door STOP is the same for both versions. In any case you can really feel the difference in the weight of the Front doors of both the cars. I am just wondering why could Maruti not use the heavier steel on the rear doors and boot lid too? I think they just wanted to keep their costs down and yet lay a claim that the new Baleno was slightly better than a tin can. I don't think any other vehicle manufacturer would ever use different grades of steel for the Front and the Rear doors.

Coming from a Celerio AGS, the AGS on the Baleno is still bad and leaves a lot to desire at highway speeds. The response and feedback to acceleration input is very very slow. What I like is it still holds the higher gear and the engine does a great job to pull through. A manual gear shift would have been remarkable here, I guess hence the manual option . Yet, the gearbox must be competent enough to handle such mundane situation Overall It's a premium city car that I knew very well at the time of purchase and I have no complaints driving it within the city. We are also trying to change our Celerio AMT to Baleno AGS. How is Baleno AGS to drive in the city with bumper to bumper traffic? Is there any jerk? Performance is not an issue for us but we are spoilt by other smooth automatics (TC and CVT) we have, so poor AGS is a sore point. Currently evaluating Ignis and Baleno. This will be strictly a city car for us. The extra comfort/convenience features of Baleno Alpha over Ignis Alpha is tempting me to ignore the extra size of Baleno over Ignis. My wife will be the primary user of this car. Tried Ignis AGS but I was a bit surprised to see that Ignis AGS is still very crude. Though it felt much nicer than Celerio, which has the worst AMT tuning, the expected smoothness is missing during gear shifts. I liked Ignis for its tiny size, as smaller foot print is really a boon for city parking. Waiting for test drive of Baleno to see if it is any better in terms of smoothness. May be it was the issue of poorly maintained the test drive vehicle that Ignis was not good.", 26th February 2024,maruti-baleno,KA,214,532,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

Hi, The AGS gearbox in Baleno is a slightly improved version from the Celerio. Its not a huge step up. The jerks between gear shifts are not very pronounced now however it exists, I believe, due to the nature of the AMT. It can never be as smooth as any other gearbox out there. However, you might have observed this on the Celerio, this gearbox adapts very well to your driving style especially acceleration and I find that engaging. Baleno is not a hassle when you are driving in city, be it crawl traffic or sudden bursts of acceleration, it adapts. Its only the highway, if driven enthusiastically its slow progress. In terms of comfort, drivability, maneuverability and mileage, its certainly very premium and comfortable and I have no complaints about the car.", 26th February 2024,maruti-baleno,Bangalore,221,201,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

I can tell you that the jerks are there and they are more pronounced in lower gears ie. from 1st to 2nd and 2nd to 3rd. You cannot miss them. You will be reminded constantly that this is an AMT. You can however try to reduce the jerks by easing on the accelerator, giving it time to shift and then step on it again.

515, Minato , 16:56 ,Newbie,"Today I took a longish test drive of Baleno Alpha AGS. The condition of test drive car was good enough, a 2022 or an early 2023 model and driven approx. 8900 kms. If you drive hard and accelerate quickly from standstill, the head-nod is pronounced, and everybody will feel it. During fast overtakes, kickdown is barely noticeable. However, if you drive with a very light foot, one will not feel any jerks or any head-nod. Acceleration is decent and is absolutely linear. Engine sound is definitely audible at higher speed and would pierce AC sound easily, post 70+ km/h. I could be critical here, as I have very sensitive hearing. If take the car, over a steep slope and have to start from a steep point, the engine could get noisy to climb over it. The steering is below average, though can be controlled with one hand, however the self centering is not good. You need to quickly bring it back to center to control during traffic. But definitely an improvement from previous Marutis'/Suzukis'. Interiors are subjective, but I personally did not find the cushioning too soft or hard, just good enough. It could also because, the test drive vehicle was from 2022/2023 edition and cushioning could have become a little hard due to weather. Arkamys Sound is just ok and would not come close to your home speaker system. I probably am took cynical to expect a 4/6 speaker systems of cars to match a proper 2.1 speaker systems. If one is looking for absolutely smooth drive experience, one need to look away from AGS, and consider CVT. It will be absolutely smooth drive experience.
