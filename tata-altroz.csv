2, Aditya , 11:14 ,Team-BHP Support,"Exterior A huge shoutout to Deepam Kothari & his dad Uttam for lending us their spanking new Altroz! Very grateful for the generosity! Tata couldn’t provide us a car for reviewing. Upon our asking the community for help, 16 owners reached out within a week! A heartfelt thank you to all of them. Team-BHP’s sales charts show that in the Indian automobile market, the B2 hatchback segment is the largest among all. Cars like the Swift, Baleno, Grand i10 & Elite i20 regularly sell more than 10,000 units every month. Tata didn't have a strong contender in this space. The Bolt - its last entry in the segment - sank without a trace. Enter the Altroz. The Altroz is a fabulous looking hatchback that features Tata's Impact 2.0 design language. It looks radically different from any Tata hatchback built before. Unlike the Vista or Bolt, no one will say there is an ""Indica influence"" on it. When the car was displayed at the 2018 Auto Expo as the 45X Concept, it drew a lot of attention. The production version looks equally good and manages to turn heads very easily. The Altroz is based on a new platform called ALFA (Agile, Light, Flexible and Advanced). This platform will be used to underpin the production version of the upcoming Tata H2X concept / Hornbill as well. The car has a kerb weight of 1,036 kg (1,150 kg for the diesel) making it the heaviest car in its segment - whether that's good or bad depends on your perspective, but weight does blunt performance & efficiency. The Altroz's doors, tailgate and bonnet have a good deal of weight to them. There's very little flex if you press the metal with your thumb. The car feels solid & well-built throughout. Paint quality is good and the panel gaps, while not very tight, are even. To power the Altroz, Tata Motors has used a 1.2L, 3-cylinder petrol (from the Tiago & Tigor) and a 1.5L, 4-cylinder diesel engine. Both engines are mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. The car is available in five trim levels and four customization packages. We feel that Tata royally goofed up in the powertrain department. For one, the petrol is the weakest in the segment. Second, the diesel was ""launched"", but never made available as Tata decided to release it after BS6 fuel is rolled out. Lastly, there are no automatic gearboxes on offer. Sure, all of these might be fixed eventually, yet the impact is largest at launch. If sales figures of the initial months are anything to go by, the Altroz has had a lukewarm start in the market. Coming to safety, the Altroz is equipped with dual front airbags, ABS + EBD, Cornering Stability Control, reverse parking sensors, ISOFIX child seat anchors & seatbelt reminders (for driver + front passenger, both) as standard. The top variant further gets a reversing camera, automatic headlamps & wipers and voice alerts. The ALFA architecture has been developed with advanced high strength steel and reinforcements. Tata Motors claims that it offers an energy-absorbing body structure, which provides a controlled crash load path for impact, and prevents the cabin from deformation with crumple zones and side intrusion beams. It's not just PR speak like other manufacturers = the Altroz has received a mighty 5-star rating in crash tests conducted by the Global NCAP . Tata Motors is offering a standard warranty of 2 years / 75,000 km, which can be extended to 5 years / 125,000 km. We strongly recommend this warranty extension as brand-new Tata cars are known to suffer niggles & issues. Without customization, the Altroz petrol costs between Rs. 5.29 - 7.69 lakhs while the diesel costs between Rs. 6.99 - 9.29 lakhs. This means the car is priced just under the Elite i20, but higher than the Baleno. Sleek, smart & mature face features a slim grille and large bumper with a massive black air dam. Use of chrome is subtle - just the way we like it. See how high the foglamps are placed: Equally chic rear features a large black applique on the hatch with chrome ""ALTROZ"" lettering. Rear windshield looks too small for the car though: The Altroz measures 3,990 mm in length, 1,755 mm in width and 1,523 mm in height, with a wheelbase of 2,501 mm. This makes it the widest car in the B2 segment. Notice how the rear door handles are concealed: Flared wheel arches & strong character lines give the Altroz a muscular appearance: This is definitely among the best looking hatchbacks on our roads today. Tata says that the Altroz's design is inspired by the world of laser carving: Blackened headlamp clusters have a thick piano black strip on top and some chrome around it. Auto headlamps are available in the XZ and XZ(O) variants. Foglamps are located high on the bumper. They have integrated LED DRLs and double up as cornering lights: A look at how the headlamp cluster sticks out at the top: A look at the headlamp cluster with all the lights in action. Low beam is excellent, while the high beam is just satisfactory. Headlights have a follow-me-home function, which can be operated by pressing a button on the key fob: LED DRLs are bright and prominent, even under direct sunlight. They are small though, especially when compared to the big strips we see on so many cars. To switch them off, turn the light switch to the parking lamp position & back to the off position twice in quick succession. They also go off when the pilot lamps/headlamps are turned on: Slim + wide black grille has a honeycomb mesh pattern. A thick piano black insert runs along the top border, while a slim chrome strip runs along the bottom: Chrome inserts on this borrowed car are an extra accessory: The wind deflector underneath: Shockingly, no underbody protection at all! Not even a plastic cover below the engine. Couple that with the unladen ground clearance of just 165 mm, and it does get concerning: Bonnet features a subtle center bulge and two creases: Rain-sensing wipers have been provided on the XZ and XZ(O) variants. Sensor for the same is located on the windshield: Frameless wipers look smart. Their spindles are concealed under a plastic cowl... ...and so are the windshield washers: They squirt out effective sprays (rather than jets) of water. Wipers are long enough to cover a large portion of the windshield: Shiny black ORVMs are standard on all variants. Chrome inserts are added in the XZ and XZ(O) variants. Unlike most modern cars, turn-indicators aren't integrated in the ORVMs: Protrusion on the lower surface of the ORVM - provisioning for a 360-degree camera system in the future? Turn-indicator sits flush on the front body panel: Door handles feel solid. Request sensor and keyhole are provided only on the driver's side. IMHO, at least a request sensor should have been given on the passenger's side: Shut lines are even for the most part: However, in some places, they are wider than others. E.g. these gaps around the hatch: Finishing could have been better in certain places. This chrome bit above the headlamp sticks out when you raise the bonnet. Looks bad: Blackened window panes & B-pillar. Roof slopes down towards the rear, while the window line rises. Small quarter glasses are provided at the front. Overall glass area is sufficient to let enough light into the cabin: Thick shiny black panel below the windows is an interesting design touch. Tata Motors calls it the ""comet shoot belt"". Fancy words aside, we think Tata's design is in the best form it's ever been! Black panel on the C-pillar has a scooped out section from where you can access the door handle: Flared wheel arches stick out prominently. Thankfully, the wheel-tyre combination does a fair job in filling them up: A couple of strong character lines run across the doors: 16” black and silver laser cut alloy wheels shod with 195/55 MRF ZVTV tyres fill up the wheel wells. Alloy wheels are available only in the XZ and XZ(O) variants. XT variant gets 16"" steel wheels. Diesel XT & XZ variants get 185/60 section tyres. XE and XM variants come with 14"" steel wheels and 165/80 section tyres: Aero flaps ahead of the front and rear wheels: XZ(O) variant comes with a glossy black roof. Long and thin antenna sits at the front. On such a handsome car, Tata should have fitted a short stubby or shark-fin antenna instead of this outdated one: Rear section of the roof is ribbed to increase rigidity and minimize material weight. The hatch gets a neatly integrated piano black spoiler that is shaped such that it merges with the design of the roof panel: Notice how the thick black panel (on the side) makes it merge with the thick border of the rear windshield: Slim HMSL with washer are housed in the rear spoiler. Sadly, only the XZ and XZ(O) variants get the (useful) rear washer/wiper: Large tail-lamps with a thick black border. There is only one reversing light provided (in the left tail-lamp cluster): We love how the tail-lamps stick out. Tata has really gone all out in terms of design with the Altroz: With all the lights in action. When the brakes are applied, only the outermost red units come on: Hatch features a glossy black panel which merges with the tail-lamps. Windshield's thick black borders restrict visibility. Small rear wiper just about does the job. Can't have a larger unit due to the windscreen's limited height: With the smartkey in your pocket, simply press the black request sensor located under the ""T"" badge to open the tailgate. Reversing camera is smartly concealed on the piano black panel: Rear bumper extends all the way up to the funky tail-lamps. The lower portion has a slim black insert which houses the rear foglamp (in the center) and a pair of slim reflectors (on the sides). Two parking sensors have been provided: Tail-pipe & end can are blackened to minimize their visibility: With one of the stronger players in the B2 segment. The Altroz looks far more modern, but the Elite i20 has a cleaner design: ", 16th April 2020,tata-altroz,Mumbai,"17,608","76,005"
3, Aditya , 11:14 ,Team-BHP Support,"Interior - Front The front doors of the Altroz open & shut in a triple-stage action. As mentioned earlier, they have a good amount of weight to them. They feel robust and sound awesome when you shut them. The doors open at a 90 degree angle and the running board is not very thick. Thus, it's very easy to step in and out. On the inside, the Altroz offers sufficient legroom & headroom at the front. The front windshield is large, although the roofline slopes downwards and I found the rear windshield to be on the shorter side. Still, the side windows allow enough light to enter the cabin. The cabin is classy looking. The dashboard is black & whitish grey with a large silver insert. Tata calls it ""classique satin chrome finish"". We feel the choice of colour feels a generation too old though. The seats get full fabric 3D-embossed grey upholstery, which we feel goes with the interior. Mood lighting has been provided on the center fascia and in the foot wells. Coming to the interior quality, it is very good. That said, the finish in certain areas is not as perfect as some of the car's competitors, while gaps between panels are wider than you expect. Still, they are even and no owner is likely to complain. The dashboard looks classy!! It has a black & whitish grey theme with a large silver insert. The carpets are black and will do well to conceal any signs of soiling. Ergonomically, the cabin is sorted and all controls are easy to reach. The feel, quality and finish of most of the buttons / switches are good: Plastic cowl on top of the instrument cluster feels sturdy. In this pic, also check out the funky hexagonal detailing on top of the dashboard: Huge windscreen offers a good view of the road ahead: Thick A-pillars (like most modern Tatas), so be careful on the bends. Tiny quarter glasses at the base of the A-pillars do little to reduce blind spots: Leather-wrapped, flat bottom steering wheel with dark silver inserts is superbly thick and has a fantastic design too. The steering is lovely to hold and comes with contours for your thumbs: Buttons for the infotainment system, telephony and voice commands are placed on the left spoke. Useful mute function has been provided (long press to mute). Notice the small horn symbol (next to steering buttons on both sides). Press that for the nice-sounding horn! Convenient. Cruise control and MID buttons are placed on the right: Steering is only adjustable for height! Not cool in a car that has premium aspirations. If you prefer a laid-back driving position, you will find the steering to be too far away. Should've had telescopic adjustment: Engine start/stop button has an illuminated border + silver ring around it. If you press the button without pressing the clutch, an orange light glows (""accessory"" mode). Press it once again and a green light comes on (""ignition on"" mode). When the engine is running, the green light stays on: Instrument cluster consists of an analogue speedometer, a 7"" LCD screen with a digital tachometer and an MID. The digital area has excellent quality graphics! The entire cluster should have been a size or two bigger though. Many of you will find it small (we've noticed this in other Tata cars too). The digital tachometer looks really cool, but the exact rpm level is rather difficult to read on the go. A digital engine temp gauge has been provided at the base: MID has a digital fuel gauge, two trip meters with average fuel consumption + driving time + average speed (individual readings for each trip meter), instant fuel economy (graphical bar), distance to empty, time & outside temperature. Gimmicky power and torque meters have been provided - these undeniably have novelty value: MID warning if the front passenger or driver haven't buckled up. It also warns you if the fuel level is low or if it detects that you have been driving for too long and need to take a break: MID asks you to lower your speed whenever you cross 120 km/h with simple instructions = Slow Down. A small speed limit sign comes up in the MID when the speedometer crosses 80 km/h. It stays on till you slow down: MID will warn you if a door or the tailgate has been left open. If one of the doors and the tailgate are open together, the door is shown as opened, with the tailgate highlighted in red. We respect this kind of attention-to-detail. There is no warning for the bonnet though: The instrument cluster's colour theme can be changed via the infotainment head-unit. Here it is in magenta: And in yellow: Thick stalks feel durable. Auto headlamps and rain-sensing wipers work like a charm. A lane change indicator is present. Headlamp leveler is smartly placed on the stalk itself. Like in other Tatas, the DRLs can be turned OFF / ON by moving the light switch to the parking lamp position & back to the off position, twice in quick succession: Air-con vents are symmetrical. They have a silver border and are housed on the silver panel of the dashboard. Nope, their air volume cannot be adjusted. The right vent can be shut by moving the controller to the extreme right and vice versa. Even in the shut position, there is some air coming out of them: Buttons to operate the front + rear foglamps and to disable the engine start/stop function are located below: Driver-side cubby hole is fairly deep. The base is slightly lowered in order to hold coins / loose items: Fusebox & OBD port are located to the right of the dashboard. The cover is easy to remove & insert back: Bonnet release isn't perfectly positioned in the dash cutout. That said, it is robust and feels long-lasting. Notice the lower edge of the dashboard. It is sharp and could have been finished better: Just look at how wide the door opens!! The doorpads have a black and whitish grey theme, just like the dash: Top of the doorpad gets the same, sweet design pattern as the dashboard: Doors are thick and so are the doorpads: Door handles are finished in silver and feel sturdy. Doors can be locked by pushing the handles inwards and vice versa. The grille next to it doesn't house a tweeter. It's there only for aesthetic purposes: Fabric insert with padding on the armrest area: Power window console is new for a Tata car. Red light on the 'window lock button' appears when all passenger windows are unlocked. Should have been the other way around. Driver's window gets one-touch-down convenience. Rotary ORVM adjuster on top. ORVMs can be retracted electrically as well: Door pockets are deep, wide and useful. They can easily hold 1-liter bottles and some knick-knacks. The finishing of these edges is on the sharper side: Both front doorpads have very useful umbrella holders! Yes, they have drainage holes too (we asked Tata): Running board isn't too wide. No scuff plates provided: Comfy front seats offer satisfactory support, both - lateral as well as under-thigh, for a person of a medium build and height. Larger users might find them a bit tight though. The adjustable headrests are soft. Cushioning has enough firmness to keep drivers from getting tired, even over long distances: XZ and XZ(O) variants get a height-adjustable driver's seat. Lever to adjust the height is robust: Sturdy metal lever for fore & aft adjustment too. Both adjustments have a good range: Zooming in on the smart upholstery design: Center armrest gets black fabric with white stitching. It is adjustable; can be slid forward for shorter drivers to use. A useful touch which many expensive cars don't offer: Seatbelts are height-adjustable. They are soft and easy to pull. In this image, you can also see the lighter colour of the upper-half of the cabin: Pedals are properly spaced out. However, they are placed too low for people with longer feet. As an example, I found myself pressing the brake with the arch of my foot rather than the ball of my foot. A very usable dead pedal has been provided: The fuel flap opener is placed on the floor: ORVMs are properly sized (height and width, both): IRVM is wide enough, but the thick C-pillars and small rear windshield restrict visibility: No automatic dimming for the IRVM. Manual day / night flick switch is provided. We are baffled as to how one can give cruise control (rarely used), but not an auto-dimming IRVM (daily use)??? Rearward view is very poor due to the short windscreen height & thick C-pillars. Thankfully, Tata has provided a reversing camera and 2 parking sensors, which make backing up easy: Center fascia features a touchscreen that sticks out from the top of the dashboard. I quite like the silver trim around the gear console: Harman-developed 7"" touchscreen head-unit has a dark silver outline. Its functions are covered in detail in a separate post: A look at how the head-unit sticks out from the dashboard: These vents can be shut by moving the flow directors toward the centre. However, even if they are shut, there is some air coming out of them. Small buttons to control the infotainment system are located below: Switches for the climate control system. Any changes to the climate control settings are shown on the infotainment screen. The air-con is powerful. Even on a hot day, it chills the cabin in seconds. The blower is always audible - you can hear it clearly even on level one. While it is tolerable till level two, it starts getting loud on levels three and up: USB port and 12V power socket located at the base of the center fascia. The latter gets a cap with a chrome border. No Aux-in port provided: Below that is this storage bin for your smartphone: Bird's eye view of the center console. Handbrake is strangely on the passenger's side, as if in a left-hand-drive vehicle! Driver's hand will most likely touch the passenger's leg when using it. Will make or break that first date Two usable cupholders on the driver's side of the center console: See that key sign? You place the smartkey here to start the car (if the smartkey's battery goes dead): Deep, but narrow storage bin under the driver's armrest: Curves and a thick silver insert keep things interesting on the passenger's side of the dashboard: Glovebox has a soft opening / closing lid. Press this well-hidden button to open: 15-liter glovebox is big and has a partition on top to hold a tablet / book: Cooling vent, illumination and a ribbed floor! The inside of the lid has a pen holder, card holder, wallet holder and uniquely - two cupholders (use only when the car is stationary please): Upper tray can be removed: Without the tray, larger items can be accommodated: Peacock design inside the glovebox. It may be recalled that Tata has been putting such designs in most of its new cars since the past few years. This is the first time we've spent so many pictures on a glovebox, and we appreciate the many details here! Super-useful foldable bag hook in the passenger's footwell. Can be nifty when you pick up groceries or takeaway food: Fit of the glovebox lid is a letdown. We expected better in a car competing against the Elite i20, which has been around for a while now: Look closely and you'll see that some plastic edges could be better finished: Dual airbags are standard on all variants of the Altroz: Sunvisors are economy-grade in design & feel. Driver-side unit merely gets a flap to hold tickets: Passenger gets a vanity mirror, but there's no cover or light provided: White LED cabin light is located at the front; has a theatre-dimming effect. If there's only one cabin lamp, it's best placed in the roof's center and not here at the front. Reason? A center-positioned light serves both seat rows: Small storage compartment in the roof console can accommodate a pair of thin sunglasses. Bluetooth mic is carried over from other Tata vehicles: While there are no loose wires dangling anywhere, Tata could have done a better job in the finishing department. There are exposed metal bits in the driver's footwell: Things are neater & tidier in the passenger's footwell. What you see here is the mood lighting: Spring-loaded grab handle above the passenger's door: ", 16th April 2020,tata-altroz,Mumbai,"17,608","76,005"
4, Aditya , 11:14 ,Team-BHP Support,"Interior - Rear The rear doors of the Altroz open and close in a triple-stage action as well (rear doors usually open in a dual-stage action). They swing out at a 90 degree angle - just look at this image! Downside? Try shutting the door after being seated - it's a task! The seat is placed at a lower height than we would have liked. Taller people will have to ""sit down"" in it: Rear door handles are concealed by placing them on the edges of the doors. We like this arrangement more than the one in the current-gen Swift (with door handles near the glass section), where the glass portion is cut-off well before the passenger's head area, making the interior more claustrophobic: Gap between the B-pillar and seat is more than enough to comfortably move your feet in / out: Like the front doorpads, the ones at the rear have a black & whitish grey theme. The rear speakers are housed on them: Like the front, there is a fabric insert with padding on the armrest: The door pockets, while not as big as the front ones, are still accommodating. Can carry a 1 liter bottle with some other knick-knacks: The rear seat is wide enough to accommodate 3 average-sized adults. While the seatbase is largely flat, the seatbacks have some contours to hold you in place: Legroom is healthy and two 6-footers can sit one behind the other in reasonable comfort (although I remember the Baleno to be more spacious overall). Tata never disappoints when it comes to rear seat space: Cabin width is healthy. Three average-sized adults can sit quite comfortably on the rear seat. However, larger adults might find it a bit of a squeeze. Side occupants get soft & adjustable headrests. Nothing for the middle passenger though. Side occupants get three-point seatbelts, while the middle passenger gets a lap belt: ISOFIX child seat anchors have been provided on both sides. This is a standard feature in all variants, including the base: Seatbacks of the front seats are scooped, allowing for more knee room: A look at the maximum and minimum legroom available: With the front seat in my 5'10"" driving position, I have about 3"" of knee room to spare: The seatback angle is a level or two too upright; Tata probably did this to increase boot capacity. There is enough thigh support for medium-height adults, but even 5'9"" dudes will find it to be inadequate. Adjustable headrests are useful: The surface at the base of the front seats is soft, so it won't hurt the shin area of your legs. There is enough room under this to tuck your feet in: Headroom is adequate for most. For me @ 5'10"", I had 1.5"" of clearance. However, 6 footers will find their hair brushing against the roof liner: The center armrest is positioned at a comfortable height: It is wide & soft. No cupholders provided here though: Rear glass area is restricted (remember the short rear windscreen?). The sloping roof line means it falls below the eye line of tall occupants. Shorter occupants are likely to complain about the rising window line. Still, there is enough light coming in and the cabin doesn't feel claustrophobic: This is the max that the rear window will roll in: The C-pillar is very thick: Two seatback pockets provided. They are adequately deep and wide. These are the best to dump in miscellaneous items (even your house keys so they don't cause rattles & aren't easy to find): Rear air-con vents are provided on the XZ & XZ(O) variants. While there is only one common air volume controller, their direction can be adjusted individually. A slot to keep a smartphone is provided just below the vents, as well as a 12v power socket (no USB port though): Spring-loaded grab handles have been provided above all the passenger doors. Both the rear units have nifty coat / bag hooks: XZ & XZ(O) variants get this whitish-grey knitted, soft roof liner. Its quality is excellent! No cabin light for the rear seat occupants though: The floor hump is wide, but not high at all. Don't know why Tata is bragging about a ""flat floor"" in its marketing material when it's clearly not the case: 345-liter boot is big enough to accommodate luggage for those family trips. Bigger than the Baleno & i20, and only slightly smaller than the Jazz. Thanks to the split tail-lamps, the opening is wide: Parcel tray comes with a recessed area and raised border to keep things from rolling onto the rear seat: Removing the parcel tray makes the boot appear even more accommodating: Loading lip is high, which makes it a bit inconvenient to add / remove luggage: Boot light is located on the left: Two baggage hooks (one on each side) with a carrying capacity of 3 kg each: A well-finished button to fold the seat down. Looks upmarket: Folding the seatback down gives you 665 liters of cargo capacity. No 60:40 split though: Top tether for the child seat (there are two of them): Tailgate is cladded on the inside. No ugly bits sticking out anywhere: A tailgate emergency opener has been provided at its base: Tools are neatly arranged in a Styrofoam casing in the spare wheel: Spare wheel in all trim levels is a 14"" steel unit with 165/80 section rubber. The higher variants should definitely have gotten a spare of the same 195 mm size as the regular wheels. When using a thinner space saver, remember to drive very cautiously (due to the varying tyre sizes & grip levels): ", 16th April 2020,tata-altroz,Mumbai,"17,608","76,005"
5, Aditya , 11:14 ,Team-BHP Support,"In-Car Entertainment XT, XZ & XZ(O) variants get a Harman-developed ConnectNext infotainment system with a 7-inch floating touchscreen head-unit. It features a high-resolution display, voice recognition, the usual music inputs (USB, Bluetooth, iPod), image & video playback (via USB when the car is parked), on-screen WhatsApp / SMS display & readout, voice alerts and a reversing camera display. While there is no onboard navigation, Android Auto & Apple CarPlay integration are offered (just the way we prefer it). Lag is virtually non-existent. It's a good sound system for an OEM unit. Owners will be happy with the sound quality: You get a 100W sound system with 6 Harman speakers. Over & above the door speakers pictured earlier, Tata has provided tweeters on the A-pillars. These have subtle enclosures and look very classy: If you prefer physical buttons (as most BHPians do!), the system can also be controlled using the buttons below the air-con vents. A useful ""home"" button has been provided, along with an equally handy ""star"" button which can be assigned to your favourite function. Don't miss the shortcut button to access the telephone: The font size is fair and visibility is good, even under direct sunlight. Climate control details are on the top right; the touchscreen can further be used to control the air-con: Current track is displayed on the MID too . This arrangement can be turned off (we love it): The intensity of the ambient lighting can be adjusted from this screen. Ambient lighting can be turned off as well: You can disable the DRLs (please don't, they look good and enhance safety)... ...and adjust the timeout for the approach lights: The lighting adjustment function changes settings of the ICE as well as instrument cluster. Additionally, you can choose themes. While the blue theme is known as ""Zen"", the red one is named ""Zing"" and the yellow one is called ""Zeal"": Apart from the preset themes, you can opt for a user defined theme. This theme allows you to choose the colour you want for the touchscreen. The colour of the instrument cluster changes according to the colour chosen for the touchscreen. Here's a look at the screen in red (there is also yellow & magenta): There are two drag-out tabs on the display. The one on the left lets you control the audio & display settings. From this screen, you can turn the display off (if it is distracting you) or decide whether the song being played is cast on the MID or not (cast icon on the lower-right). Cool touch = if you switch off the display, a message first comes on saying ""display is turning off"" (it doesn't just go out abruptly): Touching the icons on the right tab displays the climate control settings: Many functions can be controlled via voice commands, including the audio, climate control & phone: The Altroz gets Android Auto & Apple CarPlay: Parking display has adaptive guidelines which move with steering input. Considering the poor rearward visibility, this & the parking sensors are very welcome. The camera quality is just average. Don't know why Tata struggles with camera quality as it should be a simple fix (new vendor or better camera!!!): At night, the display quality is poor. We didn't get to test the camera in total darkness though: The ICE can be synced with Tata's ConnectNext app. The app displays the meter readings & DTE. It serves as a remote control for the audio system + climate control and gives you insights on your driving behaviour: ", 16th April 2020,tata-altroz,Mumbai,"17,608","76,005"
6, Aditya , 11:15 ,Team-BHP Support,"There are two engine options available with the Altroz - a 1.2L petrol (tweaked version of the Tiago / Tigor engine) and a 1.5L diesel (detuned version of the Nexon power unit). The petrol is a 1199 cc, 3-cylinder, 12V DOHC, all-aluminium motor which churns out 85 BHP (@ 6,000 rpm) and 113 Nm torque (@ 3,300 rpm). The diesel is a 1497 cc, 4-cylinder, turbocharged engine producing 89 BHP (@ 4,000 rpm) and 200 Nm (@ 1,250-3,000 rpm). This is perhaps the first time in India that a variant (diesel) was “launched”, but not made “available” at all. Tata launched the diesel back in January, yet deliveries have not begun. Tata said it will wait until BS6 fuel is rolled out in the country. We sure don’t understand the point of “launching” the diesel then. Still, based on our earlier experiences with this diesel engine, it will be our pick. The normally aspirated petrol is lame. Driving the 1.2L Petrol MT Let me just say it upfront = the engine is the WEAKEST part of the package and Tata has royally goofed up in this department. In fact, besides the engine, there is no real deal-breaker with the Altroz. IMHO, it is quite a stupid decision to not give this car the Nexon’s engines from day 1. When you have the ammunition in-house, why not use it? We can’t believe that Tata spent all this effort on a sexy hatchback, then fell short in an area that matters the most. A turbo-petrol is poised to be coming soon. Why the heck wasn't it available from day 1? To give an analogy within the Tata Group, this is akin to being in a nice 5-star room at the Taj Hotel, albeit with a rock-hard mattress to sleep on. 1.2L naturally-aspirated petrol is shared with the Tigor & Tiago. Puts out 85 BHP & 113 Nm. Our recommendation = wait for the turbo petrol which was recently spotted by BHPian Bordeaux - link to post: Fire her up and you will feel some vibrations seeping into the cabin. As the engine warms up, these vibes on touch points like the steering wheel & gear lever reduce, but they remain present in other areas (e.g. on the centre armrest and seats). There is no hiding the fact that it's a triple-cylinder under the hood. Over & above the weak power delivery of this motor, what also blunts its performance is the car's kerb weight. When driving around in the city, the Altroz doesn't feel energetic like the Baleno. Power on tap is strictly ""adequate"". The talking point is its driveability, not power. You can easily potter around in 3rd gear at 40 km/h with the engine revving at ~1,750 rpm. Make no mistake = it has enough poke to carry you around town with few gear changes, albeit in a relaxed manner. You won't find the need to rev the Revotron hard as long as the driving style is sedate. However, if you need to quickly close a gap in traffic, you’ll have to drop a gear or two. Not really enjoyable as the engine gets noisy, with that classic 3-cylinder thrum too! Overall, the car is a practical point A->B commuter, but it is no scorcher at all. Like some other 3-cylinder engines, city driving can get a tad jerky, especially in stop & go traffic. One needs to be more careful with the accelerator & clutch pedal co-ordination to avoid jerks. Highway performance is rather ordinary; on the open road, you'll need to work the engine hard to get any kind of pep out of it. Problem is, there isn't much ""go"" even when you do, hence we suggest you move out of the fast lane and stick to the middle ones. The engine starts losing steam beyond 5,000 rpm and it gets quite vocal too. Compared to the butter-smooth 1.2s of the i20 & Baleno, the Altroz's engine sounds harsh at high revs. If you insist & hit the rev limiter, the fuel doesn't cut off suddenly; it will hold onto ~6,250 rpm (~5,750 rpm in Eco mode). It's better to just drive in a calm manner & cruise instead. Why try making a car do something it cannot? In terms of cruisability, 100 km/h is seen in 5th gear at ~2,750 rpm and 120 km/h at ~3,250 rpm. We found the car running out of breath beyond the 100 km/h mark, and progress becomes slow thereafter. Do note that overtaking manoeuvres will require proper planning and lots of downshifting. With a full load of passengers + cargo onboard, we are apprehensive about the Altroz's performance on the highway, as well as in stop & go traffic on steep hills. As if to make matters worse, there is an ECO mode which dulls the engine & throttle response. This mode is strictly for those who drive extremely sedately, are never in a hurry to get anywhere and very FE-conscious. We would recommend sticking to the regular ""City"" driving mode. In terms of NVH, wind noise is controlled at 100 km/h, while road and tyre noise are average. Engine noise, however, is always present. At mid-level rpms, a very throaty sound filters through - it's almost diesel-like! And at high revs, it is annoyingly noisy. The Altroz petrol uses the same TA65 gearbox (also seen in the Indica eV2) as the Tiago and Tigor. The 5-speed manual gearbox's throws aren't long and the shifter's operation is decent. Its gates are well-defined and we had no trouble slotting into the gear we wanted to engage. The gearbox isn't the slickest one out there, but it gets the job done. What you will appreciate is the clutch which is very light and has a short travel range. It is a boon in bumper-to-bumper traffic conditions. There's even a very usable dead pedal to rest your foot. ARAI mileage rating? 19.05 km/l. For the FE-conscious, the XT, XZ and XZ(O) variants are equipped with an idling start/stop system, which switches off the engine when it's idling to save fuel. Revotron unit does not get an engine cover. Surprising that Tata left it out, since the cheaper Tiago got one (image link)!!! Transverse-mounted 3-cylinder petrol is an easy fit inside the engine bay. The eagle-eyed among you have already noticed that the air filter position has changed: Bonnet has a good deal of weight to it. Insulation sheet provided under the bonnet. Notice the marked cutout on the left. Does that mean a sportier version is on the anvil? There is some plastic underbody protection, but it's towards the firewall. Nothing under the front portion of the engine bay: Gosh, look at how far the headlamp stretches! The 5-speed gear shifter. Unlike our test Harrier (image), the text is properly aligned this time: Gear lever gets a leather boot and silver insert. Looks great: Press this button to engage ECO mode: The selected drive mode is projected in the instrument cluster. While ""City"" is shown in white, ""Eco"" is in green. Additionally, a female voice prompt tells you which mode you have selected: Gearshift suggesting tool has been provided. Newbies will appreciate this feature. However, it only shows the up or down arrow sign, next to the current gear engaged (some cars now show you the suggested gear number too): With the idle start/stop function enabled, when the system senses that the cabin temperature is higher than the set temperature on the climate control system, the engine starts on its own after showing this message on the MID: ", 16th April 2020,tata-altroz,Mumbai,"17,608","76,005"
7, Aditya , 11:15 ,Team-BHP Support,"Ride & Handling The Altroz is equipped with an independent McPherson strut dual-path front suspension and a twist beam rear. The dual-path strut has two separate paths for energy to be transferred from the springs & dampers, allowing it to be better tuned (it's a 2-cup system). Tata cars are usually known for their absorbent ride quality. In the case of the Altroz, Tata has traded some ride comfort for a sportier / mature setup, which results in the suspension being firmer than we would like in a family hatchback. At low speeds, the ride has a distinctly firm edge to it. While you can live with it, the tune is far from what we can call ""plush"". The Altroz doesn't ride as well as some competitors on bad city roads. Big potholes will be prominently felt inside & bother you. Tata recommends a relatively high tyre pressure of 35 PSI which could be one of the reasons (30 - 32 PSI will definitely improve matters). Another contributor is the 16"" wheel size that comes with the XT, XZ and XZ(O) variants. Lower variants with 14 wheels and taller rubber will ride better for sure. As speeds increase however, that mature suspension results in good ride quality. The suspension becomes compliant and on the expressway, there is no bounciness - she rides quite flat. Firmer suspension tunes also recover well from road undulations. On the highway, the Altroz handles broken roads decently and dismisses smaller potholes with aplomb. Larger bumps do filter through though. Most of the time, the suspension goes about its job silently and isn't clunky or loud (except when it hits large potholes). Straight-line stability is very good for the segment. There is no floatiness or nervousness experienced. The car is well-planted with satisfactory high speed manners. The 195/55 R16 MRF ZVTV Ecotread tyres provide fair grip levels for an average Joe. Enthusiastic drivers might want to swap to grippier tyre models. The Altroz holds onto its line well and doesn't understeer easily. Body roll is controlled and the car never gets unnerving. But again, we felt that the Altroz lacks the sort of power to unsettle it in corners. The electric power steering is one of the nicer units around. That thick steering wheel is a delight to hold. It is light at city speeds (one-finger-light at parking speeds) and weighs up sufficiently well as the speedometer needle climbs. The EPS isn't dead and does give you some feel of what the front wheels are up to. The only thing we didnt like with it was that it is too sensitive even at high speeds. While it is not as dangerous as what we saw in the Harrier, it still makes the car's front end twitchy. Hold it firmly at expressway speeds. The Altrozs 165 mm of ground clearance is about average in this segment. While it is not as high as the Ford Figos 174 mm or the Baleno + Elite i20s 170 mm, we didn't scrape the car anywhere. Team-BHP ownership reports will tell the real-world story. The Altroz has a turning radius of 5.0 meters, which is slightly wider than the Baleno's 4.9 meters. We found the brakes to be progressive and doing the job as expected. They have cornering stability control too (Tata says ""CSC supports / stabilizes the vehicle during partial braking in curves by reducing pressure at the required inner wheel. This helps to reduce the probability of vehicle oversteer during cornering + braking""). From high speeds, the car stops in a straight line sans any drama. McPherson dual-path strut suspension and coil springs in the front: Twist beam suspension with coil springs at the rear. Must say, that's a clean & tidy underbody: ", 16th April 2020,tata-altroz,Mumbai,"17,608","76,005"
8, Aditya , 11:15 ,Team-BHP Support,"Other Points • A turbo-charged petrol version of the Altroz is being tested. We recommend waiting for that as the normally aspirated 1.2 is weak. A dual-clutch AT is also rumoured to be coming. • Manufactured at Tata Motors’ Pune facility. The first car was rolled out on November 27, 2019. • A sedan based on the Altroz is in the works. Thanks to BHPian RavenAvi for sharing this information. • The Altroz is offered with factory-fitted customization options! This is done through an online platform called Imaginator. Customers are able to choose what extras they want & Tata will then create the car as per the choice of variant + features required. The customization would not affect the warranty of the car, as all the extra features would be factory-fitted. There are 4 customisation packages – Rhythm (for XE & XM), Style (for XM), Luxe (for XT) & Urban (for XZ). Click here to check it out, or watch the video here. • Standard warranty of 2 years / 75,000 km. Extended warranty is available for an additional 1 year / 75,000 km, 2 years / 100,000 km or 3 years / 125,000 km. As always, we recommend the max available coverage, especially with any Tata / Mahindra car. • Initial 3 services are free. 1st is at 1,000 - 2,000 km / 2 months, 2nd service is at 7,000 - 8,000 km / 6 months and 3rd at 14,500 - 15,500 km / 12 months. Post that, the scheduled service interval is 6 months / 7,500 km. This is short (competitors offer 1 year / 10,000 - 15,000 km intervals). Translated = Altroz owners will visit the workshop twice as much as owners of competing cars. • ARAI-certified fuel efficiency: Petrol = 19.05 km/l; Diesel = 25.11 km/l. • Doors auto-lock at 15 km/h as you move along. They also auto-unlock when you switch the car off. Over & above, there is an auto-relocking system (if no one enters the car for 30 seconds after unlocking). • ORVMs are auto-folding (i.e. they fold out when you unlock the car & vice versa). • Take the keyfob out of the car with the engine running & the horn sounds intermittently to warn you. • XZ(O) gets a contrast black roof. However, it is available only with the High Street Gold, Avenue White & Downtown Red colours. • The Tata Altroz brochure can be viewed here - Tata Altroz.pdf. • Disclaimer: Tata invited Team-BHP for the Altroz test-drive. They covered all the travel expenses for this driving event. Adding a clarification here due to lots of queries = we were indeed part of the Altroz media drives that were held in December. However, as is the usual practice, we call for the car in Bombay for 5 - 6 days for our detailed review + photoshoot. Tata was unable to provide us with a media car at our office, hence we had to borrow the white car from an owner.", 16th April 2020,tata-altroz,Mumbai,"17,608","76,005"
9, Aditya , 11:15 ,Team-BHP Support,"The Smaller yet Significant Things We absolutely love the High Street Gold colour (thanks to BHPian Leoshashi for this pic). Very unique: Actually, this is one car that looks fabulous in any colour: Remember the peacock design in the glovebox? There's one on the bottom-left corner of the windshield as well: Subtle protrusion on the rear wheel arch acts as a splash guard: Small fuel tank of 37L is only slightly larger than the Tiago's (35L). We would have liked something like the i20's 45-litre capacity: The Altroz's dietary preference is marked thrice! In a country full of careless petrol-pump attendants (and owners too), this is a must-have: Nice, premium sounding Hella dual-tone horn: Front wheel well gets plastic cladding inside... ...but the rear gets very little of it: Driver & front passenger - BOTH - get individual seatbelt reminders. The driver reminder comes on even if the car is stationary. Passenger seatbelt warning comes on only if the passenger hasn't buckled up when the car is moving. There are audible warnings, and a voice prompt as well: Google Map directions are displayed on the MID (via Android Auto). Super cool! In addition to the audible alerts and MID warnings, a small orange-coloured “speed limit” sign comes on (below the temp gauge) when you cross 80 km/h: When cruise control is engaged, this image is momentarily displayed on the MID: A peek at the cruise-control display. The function works at speeds above 35 km/h. Also notice the generosity of this gentleman who lent us his brand-new car with ~200 km on the clock Ugly gap between the dashboard & steering console is neatly covered up: Provisions to hold the driver's floor mat in place: Blue ambient lighting is provided on the dashboard... ...storage bin (ahead of the gear lever)... ...and both footwells: Tyre pressure of 35 PSI to be maintained at the front & rear, irrespective of the number of people in the car. We feel it's on the higher side. This is definitely a contributor to the firm ride quality we mentioned earlier (but not the only contributor). Lowering tyre pressure to 30 - 32 PSI should noticeably improve comfort levels: Door's rubber beading is soft, of good quality and well-fitted. A felt-like layer of beading has been used as well. Wind noise is kept out well: Rear seatback bolts are nicely concealed with carpet material. We really like this treatment: As mentioned earlier, the finish of some plastics has room for improvement. This is the handbrake console: Door ajar warning (in the instrument cluster) tells you specifically which door is open. It covers the tailgate too, but not the bonnet (about time all manufacturers add bonnet coverage IMHO): This isn’t a watch or fitness band. It’s a key - like the one we saw in the Nexon! The Altroz can be opened & started with this wearable smartkey. Would've been cool if it showed the time (could've been worn as a watch then) and added some fitness features (e.g. counting steps which is the trend today). Tata says that it's waterproof too: Smartkey is identical to other Tata cars. It is nicely finished and feels premium. Headlights can be activated by pressing a button on the smartkey (to help you find your way in the dark). Shiny black border looks tasteful: Tata Motors & Google have launched the ""Tata Altroz Voice BoT"" - a personalized, interactive voice experience for the Tata Altroz, using the Google Assistant.

10, GTO , 12:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Thread moved from the Assembly Line to Official Reviews. Thanks for sharing! Rating thread a fully-deserved 5 stars. Firstly, a BIG THANKS to the Kothari family for trusting us with their 200 km-run new car, and being super supportive all throughout! Very grateful, guys. Am glad that we borrowed the car and completed the review. Else, thanks to the inexplicable delays from Tata and then the lockdown, we’d still have been waiting for the media car. Man, the Altroz looks absolutely stunning! This is easily among the best-looking hatchbacks on our roads today. Take a bow, Pratap Bose & team. You guys are truly taking things to the next level. Even otherwise, while proof-reading the review, I’m grinning & grinning all through the exterior, interior & ICE posts . Then I got to the engine post . The car appears to be kickass, except for what’s under the hood. I feel sad about the petrol motor ruining an otherwise competent package. Why this super-important car doesn’t have the Nexon’s engines from day 1 is beyond me to understand. @ Tata: you have amazing powertrains READY and in-house, why the heck won’t you use them? This was the simplest part = merely a cut + copy + paste from the Nexon’s bonnet to the Altroz's! It’s like going to a war, but leaving your AK-47s behind in the cupboard. When you have the ammunition READY, why not use them? As I’d mentioned for the Harrier in 2019 (i.e. the 2020 car will be superior, and it was validated with the ’20 Harrier AT that got so many improvements), I say the same for the Altroz. Wait for a year for the better car / petrol-engine. Problem is, most customers won’t be waiting. The i20 is coming with all guns blazing; the existing competitors are strong too. Further, I cannot understand the insane premium for the diesel engine. 1.7 lakhs! That's almost 2 lakhs OTR. In comparison, Ford asks for a far more reasonable premium (look at the price chart here). There is no AdBlue system required for a small diesel, so this kind of a premium is abnormal. Heck, even higher-end cars like the MG Hector brought out BS6 versions at more reasonable prices. Tata Motors is like a competition runner that prepares really hard, wears the right safety equipment, is fast & muscular, runs in the marathon and leads it all the way….but when just 10% of the race is left, the runner collapses of dehydration. He recovers later, but is no longer leading the race...ending up in the mid-pack. See the Altroz & its lame petrol engine, or how the 2019 Harrier was launched unfinished, with flaws, niggles and no AT. Tata hurried up with the Harrier to beat the Hector & Seltos to the market = did it make any difference at all? Please take more time and launch it RIGHT from day 1. You've done it with cars like the Nexon, Hexa etc. so why not the Harrier & Altroz?", 16th April 2020,tata-altroz,Bombay,"70,236","298,017"

The car seems a bit shortchanged when it comes to engine options and AT options. Even when they have all the time, they dont seem to load them with right options. One thing I have been observing with Tata vehicles is use of too many pieces(for ex the dash area, or the rear). Doesnt give the smooth, clean classy looks. Also adds to not being able to give a good finish to the many corners that show up. Hope it will show up in customer's mindspace given the situation today.

Maruti didnt have a diesel, but they borrowed one from FIAT and their cars sold well with it.Tata why cant you borrow one from Suzuki? K12B or maybe K14B Petrol especially since this engine seems to be the weakest link. The only car which has sold well in Revotron is Tiago, to use the same engine on a car which weighs 100 kgs more is strange.

I had personally checked out the Altroz back in January and felt it to be a winner, of course the useless petrol mill and lack of AT aside. It's on my list to be my first EV car later. I understand Tata is making an effort. But they cannot expect overnight results. They'll have to sweat it out for the next couple of years. Plus the constant goof ups don't help. They cannot afford such new products to be forgotten. IMO, only the engine/AT issues are a dealbreaker. Once these two are ironed out, Tata will have one of the most complete cars they've ever made.

The wait & anticipation for it rewarded and how! Thank you so much. Rating it 5 stars for the lack of any more stars in that list! The car really shows how far Tata has leaped since HorizoNext started. A true fruit of that project. While people consider Nexon a well designed car, open the engine bay and it still shows it's Vista roots. They are finally gone with Altroz. The good finishing, tight packaging & overall merger of design & engineering is fabulous with this car. Pleasant to look at even with the bonnet open. It is a big head turner. Not possible to miss it in the crowd. Even on divided highways with median having trees, an Altroz going in the opposite direction grabs attention. It is a very tightly designed car & not exactly the largest among the peers. Yet - thanks to its width and that menacing face - it looks very large & aggressive. First time I saw one coming towards me at speed, I skipped a couple of beats. I have experienced the car personally. I like it a lot - but I'd buy only the diesel avatar of it. There was a poll recently where a BHPian was contemplating between the Nexon & Altroz. I am a Nexon owner & I was one of the very few folks who suggested going for the Altroz between the two. The car really is a big leap ahead in quality, build & overall comfort/features. A nice, safe & spacious place to be in along with nice sporty handling. Quality of materials & taste in design of the cabin is substantially better than the Nexon. These 2 cars - Nexon & Altroz are going to compete with each other for sales rather than with their peers from other brands IMO. Sales figures will show in a few months. Let's see. Engine I'll not comment on, GTO has summed it up nicely. With the 1.2 Turbo petrol from the Nexon, this car would have costed probably the highest in the segment. But it would still have sold far higher than what it would sell now. The lack of common sense in decision making at this organization really is becoming boring. Its like they want only hard-core loyalists to buy the cars & not win over more customers who think with brains. The other points after petrol engine I really don't like are these - The ORVMs are really pleasing to look at. However, there is a slight preference to style over utility. Look closely and right extreme of the mirror glass is too deep in the cowl & ends up showing the mirror housing itself rather than the view behind. Some wasted space there. A single reversing lamp? I'll even excuse the NA 1.2 petrol engine. But not this. Not in India, sorry. You give a cruise control but not 2 reverse lamps but a dummy on RHS? Especially for what is also the widest car in the segment? Indian roads / lanes are not safe & people don't really pay attention much. There are multiple angles from which a single reverse lamp is NOT visible. I hated the Polo, Punto, Tigor for this and now I dislike the Altroz for it. Its like a trend! Best looking cars goof up this item. Blasphemous. I never found cruise control of use (speed limit maybe yes, but now we have the beeper so its redundant). Why not a simple auto IRVM. It costs peanuts really. Really! I never thought Tata would go the way to skimp with a smaller spare wheel. Dayum!

Alternately they might have heard the complaints here on team bhp about features being removed after launch, and decided to solve that problem by doing it before the launch. I wish Tata develops a better gearbox for it's smaller cars. The TA65 has been bottlenecking performance of their entry level cars for over 10 years now, starting with the Indica dicor in 2008 to as recently as the Tiago jtp and now the altroz. When the nexon was launched, I was hopeful that it's gearbox would trickle down to at least the premium variants of the smaller cars, and the altroz was a prime candidate.

I still can’t understand why Tata is repeating the same mistakes from Harrier launch. I was looking forward to buy Altroz as a replacement for my Aspire because of the superior safety, but alas there is no Automatic option and I will have to look elsewhere if they are going to mate the automatic to current engine. My Aspire 1.5 DCT is only let down by the build quality and the options left in my budget are Nexon and XUV 300 both having AMT which I hate and the tasteless interiors of XUV.

23, DicKy , 17:01 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Excellent review, and couldn't have come at a better time. Pray there are atleast a couple of WIP official reviews for us to tide over this isolation. Loved the styling, especially in the flesh. Personally the only gripe I had was the rear door handle. Trust that, at night, for 90% of people, even enthusiasts would be scratching the door for the 'handle'. Its so mid 2000s design, if it wasn't for the Swift, Tata wouldn't have gone for it I guess. I mean, no one's going to be fooled by the '2 door design'. Don't particularly like the swooping black beltline piece too. Hope it doesn't make way to the sedan version. Like the variant spread too, especially the different 'packs' and customisation options. Except for the rear wash/wipe, makes the lower variants VFM too. The lower variants also get decent analogue meters, unlike the across the range stupid digital instrument cluster that Tiago/Tigor/Nexon has. Mechanically enough has been said about the 1.2 petrol. Not too much worried about the diesel detune it has relative to the Nexon, it's at par with the competition. The only 'theoratical' gripe that I have is the 5 speed gearbox. Even the Nexon with 6th gear does 100kmph @ ~2000rpm. Hope the Altroz diesel has a similar cruising ability with the 5 speed gearbox. It is Tata's lame excuse that gets me. 'The engine bay can't accommodate a 6 speeder.' Wish the Altroz success , especially with the diesel and the new direct injection turbo petrol with DCT. Not to say, the EV which launched would be the the cheapest mainstream EV. I would buy the Altroz diesel for my own use, but for family use, would have to go with the Nexon. Dad was looking to change the Etios cause his health wasn't agreeing with sedan seats and the underbody used to scrap heavily with full load (actually it was the rear mudguard most of the time). The Altroz with its low set rear seat and low GC wouldn't be a good replacement. , which the Nexon with its all round good seats and excessive GC is.

24, NiInJa , 17:12 ,Senior - BHPian,"Thanks to the Kotharis, we have another brilliant review to read I guess Petrol engines are Tata's Achilles' heel, right from the days of Indica, they haven't managed to make a good NA Petrol engine that can really compete with the Koreans and Japs. But wait, they had the turbo petrol from Nexon. Then what happened ? Some Shakuni must have advised them they keep the turbo petrol for later as a 'premium', but did not realize that the NA petrol is going to create the first impression. Somehow, I have a feeling that the Altroz might not take off, even if they launch the Turbo petrol, with DCT later because by this time, competition will come with better offerings (i20, 1.0 Polo TSi). They should have launched her with a better engine (which they already have) to start with. The premium hatchback segment is hot and extremely competitive.

This shows TATA has improved leaps and bounds and this was quite evident when I went to see the car in the showroom. The plastics and fit & finish were much better than the Nexon, though yes there are a few more rough edges to be sorted. This is also the first time I believe the interior quality has not been mentioned in the 'Negatives' in a Tata car. Great job TATA. I have been really looking forward to the Altroz if I'm buying a car anytime soon, but for sure, I will wait for the Turbo Petrol and the Diesel to be launched as well. And one thing that I wish existed in every car is the 3rd Headrest (centre headrest in the rear bench)! Why are manufacturers not providing such a basic safety (and comfort) feature is something I fail to understand. Only if the RTO insists a clause stating every passenger needs an individual headrest may we be able to see that being provided for every car registered as a '5 Seater'. I also happened to check the soon-to-be launched i20 in a different thread and it looks really promising. I wish Tata does enough to promote the Altroz and position is correctly.

But - their pricing and sales strategy with the diesel has been baffling, to say the least!

As mentioned in the review the sheet metal also is very good and doesn't flex. In my opinion Tata can launch the petrol in two engine options at different price range. This will give proper options to a diverse set of buyers. And also spruce up the service experience. These days it's getting better but still some way to go. One last point though, the new Tata cars are really good.

29, arjab , 20:56 ,Senior - BHPian,"I test drove the ALTROZ petrol, quite extensively, after it was launched in Calcutta. The styling, overall packaging, contents and fitments, feeling of robustness were all fine. However, I could not get rid of the nagging feeling that the ALTROZ will have its work cut out against the competition when it comes down to pure sales numbers. Why? After the novelty value of the styling wears off, owners will start digging deeper into the aggregates that make up the ALTROZ and that's where she'll have to put up a very strong fight to win against its talented competition, viz; the Hyundai i20, the Maruti Baleno, the Maruti SWIFT top variants and the Honda Jazz. As has been discussed many times, in many forums, the gasoline powertrain in the ALTROZ cannot hold a candle, in terms of overall ""feel"" and peppiness to what Suzuki and Honda powertrains offer. Again, like the TIAGO first gen, its not the absolute power output figures that falls short, (which can be masked by some clever gearing, just ask Renault what they did with the Triber and its puny heart!), but the way the power is delivered. While the ALTROZ plays footsie on steady, part throttle application quite well, open her up in any gear, say a typical 40-80kmph overtaking manouevre in 3rd gear, on wide open throttle, and it falls flat on its face. Apart from the vibrations, which are a constant tingle on the clutch pedal and the lovely steering wheel rim, the engine seems to pleading out to the driver, ""Sir, enough, please don't spank me so hard, I cant run much faster"". The feel is rough, the wicked ""Tiago petrol like flat-spot"" peeps in for a while and the overall aural experience sounds so unrefined that anyone with a wee bit of mechanical sympathy will back off the throttle. In the Rs 4 lakh bracket, potential customers may have forgiven such traits, but not in the Rs 8 lakh plus segment where expectations run very high. I still remember when my cousin had purchased the first gen Tata Sumo, (the one with the dog-leg 1st gear gate), the seats were absolutely flat and basic. But for some strange reason, they gave good support on long highway runs. Cut to the Safari, whose seats still can cock a snook to luxury SUV's 5 times its price, the MANZA whose rear seats were lounge like, the Indica Vista and the ZEST whose seating comfort were again superior to the competition. But what happened to the ALTROZ? Its seating is neither good nor bad. The front seats are a tad undersized. Underthigh support is lacking and it is quite difficult for persons with long limbs and over 5ft11in to get comfortable behind the wheel. If you have sat in a SWIFT driver's seat, before you sat in the ALTROZ, you will be muttering sotto voce, to TML, all the expletives you know! The rear is even mediocre. Lesser under-thigh support, and a hard upright backrest will not win it much favours, specially from our ageing parents. In fact my father, who had accompanied me on the test drive, flatly told all, that our Zest rear seat was a far more comfortable place to be in compared to what the ALTROZ was dishing up. The suspension passes muster. Again, it lacks the suppleness of the BOLT / ZEST setup and lacks the iron-fisted high speed body control of the NEXON. It's somewhere in the middle, trying its best to put up a brave face. Grip levels are very nice though with strong front end bite, good resistance to understeer and well controlled bodyroll. The calibration of the steering is spot on. Offers the right amount of feedback and feel, but possibly not as good as its cousin, the Nexon's helm. Fit, finish, contents , fitments, tactile feel and haptics are good. Everything moves with a nice, well oiled feel without the perception of the controls snapping or falling off. And that's the ALTROZ's problem. It's a very pretty looking Mr Average. It excels in styling and that's about it. Dig a little deeper, draw the Japanese and Korean competition into perspective and the cracks in the beautifully made up face start showing. And being mediocre in today's competitive world is not a good thing. If you are brilliant, you are already at the top, if you are a loser, you get another opportunity to prove to yourself to get to the top. But if you are mediocre, you are stuck in the middle, dithering, vacillating, desperately trying to find the shortest path to brilliance. I think, till date, the SAFARI STORME 400Nm, the ZEST, the HEXA and the NEXON were Tata's best attempts in their respective segments. While the first one was a swansong edition to a segment creator, the ZEST moved the goalposts in the compact sedan segment and showed the kind of engineering excellence that could be done on an ageing platform. But, the best i feel, till date is the NEXON. Again, a generation old platform, backed up by solid engineering. Radical styling, excellent packaging, competitive performance, very good dynamics and attractive pricing. And now its even ushering in the future of mobility in its EV guise. I feel bad for the ALTROZ. Not that the car is bad - but for the fact that it could have been way, way better. In its present form, it will will slay the competition as far as looks are concerned but when it comes to comparing overall performance, refinement and the many other bits that make up a motor car, the competition will be breathing down its neck very heavily indeed.", 16th April 2020,tata-altroz,MAA/CCU,"1,401","5,297"

However, contrary to the popular presumption of it being a copy-paste, I think there is (rather, was) a technical challenge in getting the 1.2 Turbo mill from the Nexon to work in the Altroz. A challenge of heat dissipation. Look how tightly that NA petrol motor is packaged in the bay already. Quite a different layout compared to the other cars using this engine. Add a turbo charged unit in that same space, I suspect they were having problems with heat dissipation & cooling. Yes agreed that the large 1.5 Turbo diesel is fitting in that bay, but then a diesel engine's operating temperature is generally far lower than that of a turbo petrol. A tight engine bay throws this challenge of quick cooling. Remember - everyone kept on saying the vent on the bonnet of the JTP twins is functional - surely its for the excess heat to blow out fast enough. With that not a possibility on the Altroz, they must have been working out the safe installation method. I'm guessing that has taken a lot of time and the engine couldn't come at launch.

Having non-funcltional cut and creases just for the sake of having them is not my definition of beauty, a few can be tolerated but Tatas have gone all guns blazing and given this one a design element in every square inch- headlights, door handles, tail lights et al. While thier efforts all well appreciated , it is always difficult to coherently bring together so many new design elements and I can only say it a partial sucess. What makes me especially turn in opposite direction is the side profile and the kink in the body below tail lights. This one is second Tata whose rear makes me curse the designers - first one being nexon. There are buyers who believe that simplicity is also beautiful and all those will skip Altroz. Maybe the pics do no do justice to the car. Maybe the car is much handsome in person. Maybe it will grow up on me eventually. Maybe some other colour bring out a more beautiful side of the car.

Thanks to Kothari family, mods and everyone involved for making this happen. Coming to the car, is the lame powerless engine Tata's way to keep the passengers safe? On a serious note - Altroz seems to be a well rounded package. Decent looks (I like Tiago facelift better for some reason), nice interiors, good space and handful attention to detail shows that Tata's design team has come of age. As a downside, I would rate the 3 cylinder engine a bigger concern than the power figures of the car.

The review didn't contain the usual headlight throw picture at night for low and high beams. Please do include it in all the future reviews, as it is a important factor. About the car, I kind of have mixed opinions. Kinda similar to what I had when the Harrier was first launched, back in January 2019. Hits- . The car looks sexy, whichever angle you look at it. . Spacious and comfortable interiors as always with a Tata car. . The famed TATA build quality. . Much bigger boot than the Elite I20. Misses vis a vis the Elite I20 and Baleno- . 3 cylinder petrol engine vs the 4 cylinder one's. 4 cylinder one is always preferable, come what may. . Below average petrol engine (maybe due to the added weight) compared to current Hyundai. The Maruti is in a different league altogether. . A 5 speed diesel gearbox vs the 6 speed of Elite I20. (I hope Hyundai is coming up with a BS6 diesel) . Some feature omissions like Auto dimming IRVM, LED headlamps(Baleno), 2 rear parking sensors vs 4 . No automatic option (the turbo petrol might come with a DCT, again with its own set of issues) . The ASS. TATA vs Hyundai/Maruti is a no contest. X Factor- All the above comparison is based on the current gen I20 and Baleno, which are on their last legs. And to be frank, we all know the new gen I20 and Baleno (launching this year), will be much better than their current generation versions in almost all parameters. That said, I am not sure, if I would pick the Altroz over the current gen I20 and Baleno. Deja Vu- Yes, the Altroz is giving me the same feeling when the Harrier was launched. I fear this might result in the failure after the arrival of new gen competition, just like Harrier faced with Hector and Seltos. Sad to see TATA playing catch up with the competition when it comes to product having a great styling package. Earlier it was vice a versa. . Sexy exterior design, marred by the same fit and finish issues the recent new TATA launches have been having. . Feature lists that are par for the course, but not enough to fend off the new upcoming competitions (Hector, Seltos for Harrier/ Upcoming I20 and Baleno for Altroz). . A below par and unrefined engine compared to the rivals, (140 BHP vs 170 of hector/ 3 cylinder petrol vs 4 cylinder of I20 and Baleno). PS- Hope this doesn't come of as rant against TAMO. My sister owns a Tiago (on my recommendation) and except some service issues, she couldn't be happier with the choice.

Hi, I think you have beautifully summed up the entire review in your post. I would like to add another point, i.e., 'The time of the launch itself'. We are already seeing average number of sales for the Altroz mainly due to various reasons as has been discussed before. The thing is, I can only see it going down in the coming months/years. This is because we expecting the new i20 to be launched later this year. The all new Baleno should be here somewhere in later part of 2021(going by the current product cycle) and the new BS-6 Jazz is expected shortly, with a Honda hatchback also in plans for a future release. Now Tata could have utilised this scenario and could have launched the Altroz with a better petrol engine and much more features to ensure that the others 'follow' them. However, with the current engine and average or shall I say 'at par' feature set, the Altroz will soon start trailing the other cars in the segment. Now you could say that the diesel heart is good, but it is a fact that most sales are going to come from the petrol engine irrespective of the caliber of the diesel engine. I appreciate Tata for ensuring a '5 star safety rating' for the Altroz. If a car with such a high safety rating starts selling more and more, it puts pressure on other manufacturers to do the same whereas it the sales number aren't too high, they don't really bother.", 17th April 2020,tata-altroz,Mumbai,"1,214","3,770"

45, Turbokick , 13:53 ,BHPian,"I feel one aspect which wasnt sufficiently highlighted in the review was the suspension setup. Altroz's ride and handling balance is easily the best in class. Especially the ride setup is perfect. It is silent and makes very little noise while doing its job. And some stiffiness adds to the excellent high speed stability. Forget cars like Baleno or i20, this set up betters the elder brother Nexon and probably the c segment sedans as well. Agreed that the engine and price equation is bit off target and it needs a powerful (and refined) turbo petrol as soon as possible. But these are the problems which can be sorted in the coming months making the car more competent. Same cant be said about the compromise in the platform to save costs in the upcoming i20 (based on Santro platform) or the rather mediocre performance in the safety tests of the lightweight heartect platform. These changes cannot be altered.", 17th April 2020,tata-altroz,Bhubaneswar,647,"1,304"

At the end of the day we responsible BHPians want a reasonably safe car at a reasonable price (unlike VWs which is selling decade old cars and charging a fat premium for their over hyped safe car/ German engineering image.) Also I would like to highlight that the current gen i20 scored only 3 stars in crash test which is a as bad as Baleno's . Maybe we overlooked this aspect because i20 had better sheet metal and better interiors.

Here are the points you can think about -Replace Tiago with Current Altroz - The Altroz with same engine, may not give you a big difference in driving experience over your current car. Additionally - you'll lose out on the convenience of AMT that you currently have while paying quite a price too. So as of now - don't buy the Altroz and stick with your Tiago. Replace Tiago with new Nexon right now - If you don't mind the extra amount to pay on a Nexon right now - it is worth every penny. Its not overpriced. You'll find it a good car and a very good upgradein your garage too. So if you want a car change right now - go for the Nexon & enjoy. The 120 PS Altroz whenever it comes - will not be cheap either. It will have an overlap with Nexon trims here and there for sure. If one has a Tiago already - Nexon is the right upgrade chronologically. An Altroz from Tiago is more of a ""half step sideways up"". Wait with Tiago and buy 120 PS Altroz when it arrives - If you don't need the high ground clearance, like a sporty low riding car to throw around on curvy roads - you can wait for an Altroz 120 PS automatic. No idea when it is coming though, so no idea how long the wait will be either. How old is your Tiago? Any express need to change it?

We would be only looking at a automatic for our next car, and honestly we love our Tiago very much to let go that easily , though a bigger car would be more practical. I have test driven the 2019 Nexon AMT and i am a fan of it. We considered Altroz as there was rumor that the new engine comes with a dual clutch transmission , while the Nexon is automated manual. We are not sure how good DCT would be , that's something we can drive and experience. Changing the car is more in a practical aspect than bored with the car.

If you don't need to upgrade right now, you could wait for a better engine as I'm not too fond of Altroz's engine. If you need to upgrade soon, IMHO you cannot go wrong with the Nexon! It's a beautiful car and very pleasurable to drive. And the latest model looks better and retains the features i miss in my older generation Nexon. And the best thing about it is the ground clearance! MBMC is on a mission to improve the roads before the congestion caused by Metro work reaches its peak. Due to this almost all roads in my area have been dug up heavily, and the Nexon absolutely shines! Where others hatchbacks and sedans hesitate, i plow over the roads fearlessly. All in all, both the cars are amazing, just choose the correct engine and gearbox option that satisfies you and you'll know which car to pick. Such a detailed review the likes of which can only be found on Team BHP! I remember seeing the Altroz on the road whilst driving on the Highway. It was a white colour varient being driven by the showroom personnel. I spotted it from behind and didn't recognise it instantly. When I pulled next to it I was bowled over by its looks! The piano black on the rear on a white Altroz looks gorgeous! The whole car overall has great proportions and is the best looking car in it's segment hands down.

I feel, post launch, few initial gold colored pictures of Altroz were not so impressive, but this car does grow upon you, reading review of this white Altroz makes me realize gravity of thoughts and efforts put by TML in this wonderful car. As per discussion below this thread, everything is in order except the engine capacity, what I think is, all car manufactures are lowering the engine size (lowering the manufacturing cost and increasing the profit margin, I'm not sure but BSVl compliance could be contributing factor too), be it, polo face lift 1 L TSI or latest Elantra 2020 1.5 L petrol. Apparently, not all but majority of Indian car buyers do yarn for lesser service and maintenance cost and the iconic 'kitna deti hai' factor to which car manufacturers are paying serious attention nowadays, also younger generation giving preference to bells and whistles (car features/electronic gizmos) rather than the engine capacity and performance.

Sadly, TATA has learnt nothing from its past mistakes with the Harrier. As they say, first impression is always the last impression; they messed the first impressions of the Harrier and paid a price for it. Surely they have improved the 2020 Harrier, but the competition has already caught up and has better deals to offer. So I wonder how well the Harrier will fair going forward. I assume the same case for the Altroz; though their working on the 'turbo' petrol motor and the rumoured DCT box; looks like it is still a good year away from being released in the market(considering TATA's lackluster approach and the current pandemic situation).

74, CarguyNish , 21:30 ,Senior - BHPian,"Excellent Review of a Great Looking car at Right Time. In this Lockdown period, time doesn't move as expected, hence this review came at right time. I had a quick First Look of Tata Altroz back in January. Being a loyal customer of Tata, I was attended immediately and everything was explained, hatsoff to that Executive, who had so much information about this car, he even managed to answer my questions, as things got interesting, a phone call made him disappear, didn't see him even when leaving the dealership. Then a lady comes in and attends me, she too was equally very good. I continued to ask her questions, of which some where related to launch 1.2 Turbo Petrol + DCT to which she said, it's under development and will launch at end of this year, (already knew that) Till then, the Altroz will remain in manual only option. After the conversation, had a detailed look at the car and 2 things came to my mind, 1. Segment of Altroz, 2. Same Brand, Bigger and Upgradable option of my current car. So, I am taking about 1.(i20), and 2. (Tiago), those are the 2 cars I drive and it made comparison easier. If we take into consideration the i20, the Altroz simply impressed me much more than i20. Be it the design, highlights all around, alloy wheels, tail lights, stance, interior design, seats, storage spaces, etc. It simply felt superior to my i20, also it's a large car, it looked longer and wider than the Nexon standing beside it. Some things which I disliked were lack of Auto Dimming IRVM, instrument cluster. Digital part is good, but font used for analog speedo isn't good at all, looks very cheap. Rear Space surprised me because the car at Auto Expo didn't feel that spacious, but here when I sat 1st time, it immediately felt much better. Although Jazz & Baleno/Glanza are way ahead. In comparison, my i20 feels cramped. Boot space is big, but it isn't as well shaped as Jazz and also the loading lip is bit high. Test drive cars were not available at that time, since the car wasn't launched yet. But, even if I drive one it would be the Diesel. I haven't liked Petrol Engines (NA) of Tata since Indica days, I have driven Nexon Turbo Petrol which is much better, but there too I liked Diesel more. Just like Tiago, if in future I upgrade to Altroz, it will be Diesel despite my running not more than 10k/year. Post the Lockdown lift, there is buzz that car sales will pick up, I hope every manufacturer gets benefit from this. Tata needs to bring that DCT option quickly, because Honda is updating Jazz while Hyundai is launching All New i20 in August. Again when i20 launches, it'll again make life difficult for Tata, hence better Tata speed up the launch. At least a more powerful Turbo Petrol could save them if the i20 is improved thoroughly. My 6th sense says that i20 will be a hit and will leave Altroz way behind. Here are some snaps of the GOLD STANDARD. As rightly pointed out, a rare car that looks terrific in all colors.

One question though, in the comparison chart for premium hatchbacks, why is the Honda Jazz missing? Underbody covering is very important in Indian roads, what with humps and other stones etc sticking up on the road. I hope Tata looks at adding that in future. Also, disappointed to know about the weak engine. Given that its premium hatchback, and the demographics there are probably not the most sedate of the drivers out there, I wonder why Tata went with this petrol engine choice??", 19th April 2020,tata-altroz,Blr/Hyd,377,531

Shocked to know there was actually no diesel available, which Tata is known for. I have had 3 different Tata cars in past - 2004 Indica 1.4L Petrol (sold), 2010 Indica Vista 1.3 Quadrajet (sold) and 2015 Zest 1.2L TPetrol, and I know Tata's Petrol engines aren't the best, like Aditya said. My dad was a fan of Tata for it's VFM and practicality offering (clearly). Sadly with the evolution of design Tata has lost it's niche, for instance no 60:40 split at Rs.10L is just absurd. Ride quality in my Zest is undoubtedly one of the best if not the best in its segment and perhaps a segment above, on the contrary Altroz comes with a firm suspension and weak motor (possibly to limit the body roll), which doesn't add up to me. The shocking part for me was it's priced more than the Baleno, the segment leader. You add on Tata's ill famed ASS, and not sure who Tata is targeting with this. Hopefully, JTP is on it's way with the Altroz version that can make use of the car's dynamics better.", 19th April 2020,tata-altroz,Bangalore,40,134

Tata motors used to offer 60:40 split seats on their indica DLX but surprisingly Tata motors new generation hatch back cars Altroz, Tiago even top end variant XZ+ doesn't get split seats. In guise of strengthening Altroz positioning, on BS6 Tiago XZ+ variant, TATA motors decided to delete small but useful features like boot lamp, rear parcel tray strings, side body plastic moulding, multiple drive modes, projector head lamps. When Tiago is already available in AMT, Altroz not offered any type of auto transmission is not going to help its launch complete and impressive.

You can easily potter around in 3rd gear at 40 km/h with the engine revving at ~1,750 rpm. Make no mistake = it has enough poke to carry you around town with few gear changes, albeit in a relaxed manner. You won't find the need to rev the Revotron hard as long as the driving style is sedate. However, if you need to quickly close a gap in traffic, you’ll have to drop a gear or two. Not really enjoyable as the engine gets noisy, with that classic 3-cylinder thrum too! Overall, the car is a practical point A->B commuter, but it is no scorcher at all. Like some other 3-cylinder engines, city driving can get a tad jerky, especially in stop & go traffic. One needs to be more careful with the accelerator & clutch pedal co-ordination to avoid jerks. Thanks for great review, though diesel review is missing which is more important for many. Above paras are important for me in terms of engine as it is the most talking point for now in Altroz. From these observations, I think many people will not be very unhappy. Though this is not great engine, I am sure this will satisfy 60% people's needs in India. It's good for sedate drivers as review mentions, rest car is anyway very good. Lot of people see car as overall package & Altroz fits that bill perfectly. Overall very nice car by Tata and hope they will come up with different & more powerful engine as an option. Overall great car Tata, all the best.

Then D & E (say a terrible play 2 pay model, performance and bugs) will be horrible because some other development house put it together and these two pieces were united by Corporate HQ. Then through a DLC model they keep patching things up and a year or two later the game is in the state it should have been on release.

May be Tata thought they could do an i20 With the Altroz petrol (referring specifically to the i20's weakish 1.2 petrol engine) and still stack up high sales numbers. But the 1.2 Kappa is a 4-cylinder engine and leagues ahead in terms of refinement and driveability compared to Tata's 3-cylinder 1.2 Revotron. Tata should have got this right at the Altroz launch.

I think this car is the outcome when you let a bean counter decide what goes into a car. Some chart on some powerpoint somewhere on some computer inside the Tata offices is saying, release this car with an under powered 1.2L petrol. The people don't know the difference and they'll take it. The said bean counter must have decided, Baleno, i20, Figo, Jaaz all have similar Bhp and Torque output so this engine is fine and people will buy it. I understand the financials of the decision and most car buyers who don't think too much about these details will not bother either. Unfortunately, if you are on T-Bhp you aren't an ordinary buyer are you? Left to us, we'd take Bhishma MBTs to buy groceries simply because of the power output. In January I had a rather lengthy discussion with my friends on whether I should opt for the car. The XT(O) variant in all its glory at 9.13L was on offer with everything inclusive of cruise control. Very very attractive, but then I compare it with a people carrier like the Ertiga and lo and behold, same price, minus cruise control and 28 Bhp more and 25Nm torque more and a whole cylinder more and more space and more comfort.

94, puneeth2 , 20:51 ,BHPian,"I don't think having a 3-cylinder engine should be a deal breaker here. As we know, most manufacturers are offering 3-cylinder engines in their cars, even some premium brands do that. It helps them keep the car light and fuel efficient. 3-cylinders might sound different but not all of them suffer from vibrations or harshness as a lot of people here say. Yes, a relatively free revving 4-cylinder would've been good. But for an average buyer who sees a car as just a mode of transport and is happy with it as long as it work and costs as less as possible, any engine should be fine. Adding to that, Tata finds itself in a sort of a dilemma where the market and emission norms force manufacturers to produce fuel efficient engines and the buyers do not favor their cars as much as they do with other cars. Tata just has this one market for their passenger cars for now, especially for their smaller cars. It is easy to see why they have that 3-cylinder engine. Even the critically acclaimed Ford Fiesta ST has a 1.5L, 3-cylinder engine with 200PS and Koenigsegg Gemera has a 600hp 3-cylinder. Not all is bad about these engines after all.

It would be very interesting to see what the automotive enthusiasts will say when that engine comes up finally (Perhaps no sunroof then or dual clutch automatic or voice command or some other nonsense) , the reality is this. Altroz already has a competent engine - The diesel! If you do like the car, saying it has a weak petrol engine is a lame excuse, just buy it if you are really into the market for buying a car.

But TATA, how can you miss the Engine which is the heart of the vehicle? Why not Turbo engine on the launch itself? Same was the case with Harrier too with the lack of an auto-gearbox at the launch. The interest dies down after some time and people don't like to wait when they have so many options in the market. But deep in my heart, I want Indian manufacturers to lead the market.

Ever since Tiago, I think Tata has the best shaped steering in all the segments IMHO. And in Altroz, they took it one step further, it feels great to hold. Sadly I did not not get a chance to drive this car, so cannot comment on the driveability. From the outside, if the badge read Volvo, it would've retailed for 25 lakhs (I love the oldgen Volvo V40 Crosscountry and this looks a little close to that car).

I really wish it was equipped with a better engine from day 1 to complete the package. But the biggest drowner I felt was with the meter console. I am a person who glances at speedo every now and then. Even if it is a Uber, I will just glance the speedo and check how many kms it had run. I wonder what on earth TATA was thinking while approving this console on such a modern car. That speedo seems to be lifted straight from their truck range.

The (much lesser talked about) price delta between the 1.2 turbo petrol and 1.5 diesel in BS6 Nexon is 1.5 lacs . Since the same 1.2 turbo petrol will make its way to the Altroz, and assuming petrol-diesel delta is same as in Nexon (as they are detuned versions of same engines), the Altroz 1.2 turbo petrol should be ideally priced at just a premium of 10k over the NA petrol.

Has to be petrol and Auto due to low running within city 2. has to be compact, as small and easy to drive as possible 3. Safety - build quality and features like minimum 2 Airbags 4. Need the car in July urgently (Wife's learner license will expire in August so She needs some practive and go for the final test) I had test driven Altroz on release. loved it. Key highlight was the safety rating however due to the Covid scenario a lot of things changed suddenly in between. Also there was non Auto available. Now the condition as it stands is that I have a booking request for Hyundai Nios but the delivery is not in sight as the New June Manufactured stock is not yet available as per the dealership. If the Altroz Auto is available with a July release, then I can go for Altroz otherwise will persue with Nios.

We are a minority for sure considering the number of hatchbacks & SUVs we see on the road without a rear wash+wipe. However - Tata should NOT make it a standard feature unless the market becomes mature enough to appreciate safety features. For decades the TML cars have had better feature list at lower prices which hasn't resulted in sales numbers (for other reasons like perception, material quality, service confidence etc.). Its better they do what others are doing & do it right. Whats disappointing actually is - the rear wash + wipe is NOT a mandate in India like it is in many developed countries for hatchbacks and sedans. I feels mandates are required in things where the customers are not aware of real value of things. In our country sadly, we see mandates where they are most illogical and bring little value in educating people. Let's hope in line with the ABS, front airbags & rear parking sensors sooner or later we see rear wash+wipe as a standard feature on these particular segment of cars. For this single feature of rear wash + wipe - my current and previous cars have been top trim (Aura & XZ+). Otherwise I'd rather have picked the lower trim & modded it to the brim.

The response below 2000 rpm is non existent, it starts to pick-up only after that. Tiago definitely felt more responsive and I don't think a mere 50 kgs weight difference could make such a difference, I think it has more to do with the addition of balancer shaft, ECU mapping and larger rolling radius (taller tyre) instead, but, I could be wrong. Otherwise Altroz felt more composed and stable than Tiago. It is a very capable highway cruiser in terms of stability. The suspension (16"") is also very nice as half of the time I drove over gravel instead of a road and it never felt uncomfortable it just glides over them all.

Cars will always face such things in their lives & good to see you aren't too stressed out about it (like I used to be). As for the repair - did the ASC explain WHY the door needed to be changed? did they open the interior panel & check if there was any internal damage? Or just looked at it from outside and summarily told to get the door replaced? The exterior damage looks really minimal. Given that you probably did this at parking speeds - I feel there is little chance that interior structure of the door frame got compromised. Insist on the ASC to fix the door dents & repaint it. Cover that under the insurance. The ASC seems to be trying for a larger margin replacement (usual things going on in covid times sadly) rather than a repair job. The reason why I suggest ASC repair - in general Tata ASC body shops are very good & they also match the paint very well. The Altroz's gold signature shade is not exactly a commonly used paint and an FNG might botch-up the paint job.

251, Vij81119 , 07:56 ,Newbie,"First post alert Got the AL 04 ECU update on my December 20 Altroz xz model. Few changes I thought is worth sharing. The update came from a call from the TATA MOTORS itself who took the car to the nearest TC MOTORS RAJARHAT workshop for the update free of cost. I have driven the car for nearly 800 kms in this new ECU update and had already driven 700 kms in older version of ECU. So that should put both in equal footing for comparisn. Changes that was visibly noticed are 1. The power delivery improvement. There was never a lack of power in 1st ,the changes were seen from second shift onwards. My black beauty is picking up cleanly from 15kmph easily anything below 10 kmph does invite shudderness. Still a big improvement from the older version. The overtaking gears are 3rd and 4th. One can pick cleanly from 25kmph and 30kmph respectively and can pull way up till 70 without breaking a sweat. 5th gear are also having some power and is not absolutely dead as was earlier. If the overtaking maneuver is planned even 5th can be used. 2. The oil pump sound coming from the rear end has been subdued drastically. Earlier there was this continously humming sound when the sound system was turned off. But now with the update one really have to search for the sound. 3. Mileage part I am still not sure about, may be tad decreased than earlier i will update that in my upcoming post. Overall the power delivery is improved. Its not yet engaging enough but its not dull either.

One always need to compare how much the difference it is having on the diameter and width of the overall replacement. You can compare the change in the diameter and width in any of the tyre comparison sites.

259, freakmuzik , 03:07 ,BHPian,"I happened to find some time and ended up checking out the Altroz Diesel since I had only driven the Petrol exactly one year ago. Likes: 1) Smooth clutch and gearbox. The shifts were super easy and clutch was as light as that of a petrol 2) Power delivery - city driving was a breeze for me 3) Driving position & seat 4) The driver armrest was useful to me plus the gear stick was in a different, yet comfortable height compared to other cars 5) Decent power on tap 6) Audio System 7) Touched only 80 today but the car masks speeds beautifully Dislikes: 1) Bit of gruffy engine higher in the revs 2) Ride is harsh at lower speeds 3) Rear seat back-rest is a little too upright 4) The engine noise is audible (but isn't too intrusive either. Compared to the petrol, the diesel isn't actually bad) Overall, the engine is very tractable, has good power with surely good FE as well! It took off in second gear easily too. The entry ramp to the dealership was in such a bad shape and i feared it would scrape the underbelly, but it didn't! To choose between a Turbo Petrol Manual and Diesel manual might be a little tricky frankly. As i mention that, the Turbo Petrol isn't available yet for a test drive. I also entered a Honda Showroom quite close by and checked out the Jazz. Though I couldn't take a test drive, I would like to share a few points that i observed vs the Altroz: 1) Jazz trumps the Altroz in terms of Interior space and rear backrest angle though under-thigh support is comparable 2) No rear headrests in the Jazz even in the ZX trim! 3) Plastics are quite comparable to touch and to see 4) The boot of Jazz has a better shape and seems more usable 5) The seat adjustment levers of the Jazz were super smooth to use whereas it was just okay in the Altroz Mind you, Tata sells the Altroz Diesel at the same price in which Honda sells the Jazz Petrol Manual!", 1st February 2021,tata-altroz,Chennai,620,"1,340"
260, Shanksta , 13:28 ,BHPian,"Ever since the beginning of the Pandemic and the lockdown, people have been getting married like there is no tomorrow. After having successfully skipped many marriages owing to the pandemic, I just had to attend my best friend/colleague's marriage. No escaping this one ! The marriage was to take place in Madurai, which meant a cool 900km roundtrip. I was pumped and we decided to take my Innova as we were six friends travelling together. As per norm one had to drop put in the last minute and hence we decided to take another friends recently acquired 2 month old Tata Altroz XE Petrol for the trip in the interest of a smaller fuel bill. (But government be like LOL ) I was the self appointed driver since my friend is new to driving. Now that I have bored you with above story, lets get to the drive experience. STATS: Total distance Driven : 1035 Kms ( I drove about 700 kms) Fuel Consumed : 68 Liters Mileage: 15.22 Kmpl SPACE & COMFORT: * We were five healthy adults in the car and with a boot full of luggage, we had no reason to complain at all. Good Leg room and a nice wide cabin. * Lots of space to store water bottles, snacks, wallets, handbags, etc., * Reasonably well shaped boot ensured we were able to do justice to that 345 liters. * Front seats were very supportive, the rear seats were angled maybe 2-5 degrees too upright. But both have a common problem, inadequate under thigh support. Not a deal breaker but you do definitely feel the effect after a 450 km trip. * The Aircon did a great job of keeping us cool on a hot afternoon (36 degrees). GROUND CLEARANCE: To be frank I expected the Altroz to bottom out on speed breakers, owing to the relatively long wheelbase and the 165mm ground clearance. Surprise ! Surprise ! Absolutely zero scrapes thanks to the relatively stiff suspension. Just once my friend ran over a speed breaker quite fast fast and we just heard a very mild thud. RIDE AND HANDLING: The base XE version rides on 165/80 R14 Tires. I have mixed feeling about the ride. I would not say it is the best in the segment, I felt a underlying stiffness every time you go over a pothole at city speeds. At highway speeds this is greatly reduced, although you still do feel it a bit. The Handling is extremely good and almost on par with my Grande Punto. Even the XE that I drove with the puny tires was very confidence inspiring. The way the Altroz masks speed is something you have to experience. Felt absolutely flat and composed between 100-120 kmph. Minimal body roll and the rear of the car does not feel soft or bounce about much when you go over those sudden undulations and expansion joints. Special mention to the steering wheel. Weighed up nicely at high speeds, relatively light at low speeds. Will not be a deal breaker for a car guy. ENGINE, GEARBOX & BRAKES: Now we come to the so called Achilles heel of the Altroz, the 1.2L Revotron Naturally Aspirated engine. I would start by saying the reviews are quite misleading, this is an extremely decent engine for an everyday point A to B car. The engine was very tractable and I did not stall the car even once with full load, there was no unnecessary revving to get moving as well. Was able to maintain sustained speeds of 100-110 kmph comfortably on the highway. Not a performer or scorcher in any way, overtakes need a teeny-weeny bit of planning. But overall I can understand why Tata was able to sell 47000+ units of the 1.2L NA Petrol Altroz. The gearbox is a bit vague, first gear is very short. Third gear is very usable between 20-40 kmph in the city. The clutch has a long travel, but felt light. Brakes were adequate, maybe it feels a tad better in the higher variants with the 185mm rubber. I had two emergency situations and did not experience any drama inside the cabin. NVH: This is where I hate the 3-pot engine. I could feel the minute vibrations on the steering, pedals and gearbox while accelerating. The engine noise inside the cabin makes it sound like a diesel engine at high speeds. Again not a deal breaker but there is a drone. Otherwise the wind noise and tyre noise was nil. OTHER POINTS * Loved the instrument cluster in the base variant. The analog dials looked sweet with classy white lighting. * A ""High Speed"" light starts glowing on the instrument panel when you cross 80kmph. Once you cross 120kmph, an Overspeed message also pops up. * The high speed warning beep was very classy and not irritating * Tata being a company that is known for safety at the moment should seriously include the rear wash wipe as standard across the range. This is a big omission. * A-Pillar creates a bit of a blind spot and the IRVM is tiny. * Doors close with a nice heavy thud. * Stock low beams are fine, but the throw from the high beams was not adequate. * Seat belt reminder for the passenger also with a dedicated warning light. Well done Tata. * The central locking system (pushing the door handles in to lock and vice versa to unlock) reminded me of my Punto. * My Friend's car had a weird niggle, the aircon was blowing air to the footwells even though it was set only for the dashboard vents. IMHO: The 1.2L Revotron NA engine is an extremely decent engine for a daily car and is not a slouch. I found this base XE variant very decent for the 6.5 odd Lakhs my friend paid. Although my suggestion remains, If you can afford the diesel go for it. Would I buy this car ? YES ! (If I was in the market for a big hatchback with a budget of 7-9 lakhs) Can this be my next car ? NO ! Feels like a more modern version of my Fiat Grande Punto but definitely not a significant upgrade over it. ", 6th February 2021,tata-altroz,Madras,793,"2,825"
261, RavenAvi , 20:09 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"So, the first annoying feature of the XM needed a serious upgrade - the single-tone horn! I swear, I have never heard a more meeker horn than this one. Traffic doesn't even bother to move, let alone look behind - for most of them it might have been just an Activa asking for side to pass through. Heck, forget traffic, this horn doesn't even bother the flies sitting on the bonnet! I had a couple of hours to spare from my busy February schedule, so I was off to the dealership. They recommended the pressure horn (Pom! Pom! type) but I rejected it. Needed something more sleeker than that, specially something shrill which suited the Altroz's profile. And, but of course, it needed to be dual-tone. Came to know from the dealership that the new Tiago & Tigor are also coming with single-tone meek horn units, same as the Altroz! (haven't checked it out myself) You would never guess which ones I finalised. Let the pics do the talking. Out comes the front bumper + grille portion. What's that on top of the wheel well section? A closer look - it's an additional hidden layer of insulation padding! On the other side too. How thoughtful of Tata. I am told the new Nexon also has these. Label on top of the white plastic tank in front of the wheel well (second pic). Date can be seen. Label on the wiring headed out from the left headlamp. Notice the ""x451"" code? The OEM single-tone ""meekest of the meeks"" horn. Removed. The much, much elder brother of the above - from the Safari (also used in the Storme)! Notice the size and finish differences? Finding a suitable spot for the second horn was a pain. Spot finalised and wiring done. The final setup. Twin Safari babies - shrilly as heck! Each horn cost me Rs 500/-. Needless to say, the effect was seen instantly. Not only did the traffic quickly sway to the sides, but they also turned around to see which car was behind them causing all the ruckus. Nighthawk has been a real head-turner on the roads. Mine is the first Grey Altroz in our city and and it's been making a big impression on the people all around. Some also pose by our car while taking a selfie, while others come forward to check her out thoroughly. Makes us proud. I wonder what effect it will have on my wife's groups when she starts driving it. It's already become our ONIDA TV - neighbours' envy, owner's pride. Next on the agenda - OEM foglamps with DRLs.

Sreerudran shares his experience us: Quote: Issues reported is as follows from the date of procurement with just 2162 km of usage till date. This is how we have registered complaint with Tata Motors i) The roof top antenna slot found leaking during cleaning snaps attached for reference. This is a “HAZARD”, the cabin light was filled with water and this might have trigged the issue for short circuits which may cause issues to the end users life. It’s a risk and threat to end user to use the same vehicle. ii) Complaint registered on 10th Feb 2021. As per the guidance from Tata Motors, dealer contacted and have taken the vehicle on 11th Feb 2021, the same was returned after checks by 12th Feb 2021. iii) In order to cross-check the stability and consistency of the roof antenna slot cap, we have tried to wash the vehicle on 14th Feb 2021. iv) The result after washing was annoying, the Antenna cap came all the way down. This really is not a piece of quality product from “TATA Motors”. v) This is to inform that till date we used to praise TATA Motors for built quality and 5-star rating and hence we took this vehicle to home. vi) The leakage made us to think for a second time to suggest this peace of vehicle to end users like us. Case study: i) There was no proper quality fixed ceiling mount (antenna slot cap) from TATA which makes leakage. The HAZARD’s of this kind is a threat to passengers - may begin with a normal short circuit and collapse with a big loss. Conclusion: The above mentioned compliant may be simple according to organization but the consequences may not be as simple as we think where I could inform TATA Motors team that it’s a 100% quality failure from your end. This needs to be rectified with immediate effect, if you feel that this car is having batch issue please recall the vehicle and satisfy the customer with 100% CSI.

289, Vij81119 , 21:46 ,Newbie,"Got the new ECU update done by lexus motors. The visible changes were the new infotainment interface. Well this is the second update i got from tata motors. The first one was ALT 05 update (JAN 21) that I got 4 months back was definite improvement from ALT 04 which i have already posted earlier. The improvement which i got from second update (APRIL 21) are 1. The smoothness of the engine and ride went few notches up. The engine definitely feel smooth and refined than what it was earlier. What even amazes me more is i have a tigor 2017 with same N/A engine, and the refinement is clearly palpable when someone drives these two engines alternately. 2. The marked improvement is in 2nd gear. This gear now pulls cleanly even in the range of 5-10km/hr with lesser throttle input than earlier. This just takes the stress away from the clutch when in 2nd gear and gives you more confidence in bumper to bumper traffic. 3. Consecutively the 3rd and 4th gear is marginally revamped 3rd gear goes down to 20kmph and 4th to 25kmph easily. The rev range for 3rd and 4th gear is more healthy than earlier ECU. In slow traffic i at times do get quite amazed when I dont have to downshift from 4th gear even at slower speeds which wasn't the case earlier. The 5th gear is dull overall as compared to other gear range. 4. The engine overall is much much livelier and fun to drive. The marked change that I have noticed in this kolkata's summer heat is that even with AC on, the overtaking maneuvers is smooth which wasn't a few days back. I really needed to put the throttle hard to make overtaking possible earlier. 5. I even found the sound of the infotainment system more soothing and powerful but i guess that is more of my euphoria than in reality.. 6. The million dollar mileage question will take some more kilometer from my side to come to a conclusion. But the initial impression is a marked improvement from previous values. Will try and post a mileage post with values in my later reviews.", 30th April 2021,tata-altroz,KOLKATA,13,33

I have seen (and cleaned also) many a filters like these inside the cabin in passenger footwell over the years - and the amount of dust and other particles accumulated into them - definitely show they work. Maybe there are better options available - but these are not useless. Almost all manufacturers have the same density nylon mesh for this task. Denser the filter you use here - lower will me the cool air volume you get from the vents. They have to strike a balance. These are placed near the footwell on passenger side. Typically in the way the blower unit works - air is sucked from this area and blown out the top vents.

332, akshye , 13:41 ,BHPian,"My experience with Altroz 1.2 NA Petrol after 2000kms: I got behind the wheel of Altroz when the odometer read 50! Hence, I have been driving the car very gently, 30% in the city and 70% on the highway. As has been said already, it's underpowered; but it is good enough for a daily commuter. It pulls well at around 2000 rpm (and at 2200 upshift indicator shows up). For a new car, I have not crossed 3000 rpm yet. The best thing I found in this car is, it automatically rev-matches as you release the clutch. It's a great feature for a new driver or when you're switching from another car. Handling is just perfect! Car is always perfectly planted. Suspension is at right balance between comfort and handling. The brakes are alright. The OEM MRF tyres are not that good anyway, to hold with harder braking. The steering weighs up quite a bit at speed and is light enough at parking speeds. There are some design issues that are pretty annoying for daily use though.The auto AC reacts very erratically based on external sunlight/shadow. I believe the temperature sensor measures some surface temperature, rather than room temperature. So, when sunlight hits the dashboard, AC starts chilling already cool car. Hence, every time you need to set the temperature of AC, based on the way the HVAC is behaving at that instance of time (sometimes I have to set 25, sometimes 27 for the same feel). HVAC is set to 23 degrees, every time you start the car. No memory, no nothing. (Searched through settings and user manual, no work-around was found) The horn switch is too narrow - so you need to aim right for it, else you end up changing track. The track change as well is very sluggish. It takes longer to honour your request. Radio starts playing every time you start the car. No way around it.

361, naadopaasaka , 09:24 ,BHPian,"Sorry if Im late to the party: I briefly drove an Altroz for the first time yesterday with the NA petrol engine. With just me in the car, it feels fine. It isn't exciting or anything, but I won't call it underpowered with that load. I do, however, suspect that if there are 4 people or 3 + luggage, it will feel sluggish. For what it is worth, the power delivery does feel linear. The official review says that the clutch has short travel range. I found that the clutch (though light) goes very deep after the biting point. (Maybe I have misunderstood or Im just wrong.) That might get annoying, or you might just get used to never fully depressing it. The biting point is easy enough to find. I cant quite recollect but the gear felt a little rubbery. None of this is too big a complaint though. But the suspension, ride and handling are mighty impressive, to say the least! Feels like a much more expensive car. It seems to have great aerodynamics too. I can't imagine how wonderful it must feel on the highway (with the better engines, of course). It is composed and exciting, if that combination makes sense. Engine and tyre noise does get into the cabin, but again, I cant claim to have any major grievance with that. The cabin feels rather nice, although it is no Hyundai. I wonder if Tata can somehow defy the laws of physics and retain the same dynamics while increasing ground clearance a smidge. It seems like such a good package overall- spacious too. Were I in the market for a car, I probably will not mind going really slowly through major potholes/ big speed-breakers if I get to enjoy these driving dynamics. Ill pay a lakh or two less than a similarly-equipped trim of the Nexon/ XUV300 for the dynamics and higher fuel efficiency of this car, while making a compromise on the powertrain. The XUV300 has nearly 100L boot-space too. I wonder also if Tata can also offer a little more underbody protection towards the front of the engine bay in the Altroz.

I do, however, suspect that if there are 4 people or 3 + luggage, it will feel sluggish. I had this exact suspicion as well: wanted to decide between this and iturbo (a good 90k premium over NA petrol in Pune). Ended up taking a test drive with 5 family members (4 adults+1toddler) and a sales executive (all average sized adults). Even drove over a flyover with everyone aboard. To my surprise, the performance didn't suffer much- provided one shifts gears a little late (I currently drive a Hyundai Eon- so didn't feel a lot different). I surmise that the car is hefty enough- a further weight addition might not demand much extra out of the engine . To be honest though, these comparisons are strictly for city travels, and from POV of someone who is used to driving his car for going from point A to point B (a sedate driver- not an enthusiast's perspective). Also, as I have driven the car only for a test-drive distance, not sure how the fuel economy, engine health etc may suffer with such relatively frequent gear shifts. I keep hearing Altroz iturbo is a 'better Altroz': would like to know how far true this is, for someone who's not craving for performance, but is primarily going to use the car for city commutes and a fortnightly highway drives.

If the NA sells more, then it probably makes more sense to have the auto paired to it. Could probably bring more sales than if the iTurbo had the auto. While all us enthusiasts would have appreciated the iTurbo and auto together, perhaps the business believed, based on whatever market data they have, that the NA and auto pairing would make more sense. One of the comments also mentions that the pricing would have become outrageous. Even if the iTurbo and auto combo came through, would anyone have paid that much more?

413, MasterFoxD , 15:09 ,Newbie,"A general info to all BHPians owning an Altroz XZ, especially the ones with dual port headlamp configuration. As per Tata user manual (attached pic), high beam is supposed to have normal reflector with H1, 55W halogen bulb, while low beam is projector type with H7, again 55W halogen. This, according to my understanding until now, is the normal convention for bulb placement due to beam forming nature of the H1 & H7 bulbs, and accordingly I bought a pair of Phillips X-tremeVision G-force (55W) H7 bulbs as well as Osram Nightbreaker Laser (55W) H1 bulbs. Today morning I opened the lamp housing of the car and to my utter surprise, both the stock bulbs are H7 and of course, the bulb holders as well. Now I've a pair of non-returnable H1 bulbs bought for ₹1400 and I can do nothing about it. So much for believing the user manual! Yeah, I know I should have consulted the service guys prior to the purchase but in my defence, I can say that I did my research online for Altroz bulb replacement but there was not much about the high beam issue. Nevertheless, I think this sort of careless treatment of material in a user manual from reputed companies like Tata is completely unacceptable. I'm intending to write a mail to them, and even though I don't expect any personal benefit out of this to mitigate my lost money, at least someone else who refers their user manuals for replacement parts benefit from the cause.", 5th March 2022,tata-altroz,Coimbatore,11,14

Bookings for the Atroz DCT have already begun with deliveries set to commence soon. 2022 Tata Altroz DCT Specifications Unlike previously rumoured, the Tata Altroz DCT with its six-speed gearbox is being offered with the base 1.2-litre Revotron three-cylinder petrol engine only. This motor makes 86PS and 113Nm. The wet-clutch DCT used in the Altroz uses switch-by-wire technology and uses a planetary gearset that uses fewer components to improve reliability. The gearbox also has a India-specific cooling system while the shift program has been specifically developed by Tata Motors for this gearbox. The DCT also incorporates a self-healing technology that will flush the system with oil and reset valves to increase transmission life. Other engine options on offer are the 1.2-litre turbo-petrol with 110PS and 140 Nm. A diesel version is also available with a 1.5-litre motor that makes 90PS and 200 Nm. All engines can be paired with a five-speed manual. 2022 Tata Altroz DCT Features, Variants The Tata Altroz DCT is being offered with the higher XMA Plus, XTA, XZA and XZA Plus variants, along with two Dark variants. Notable features include projector headlamps, 16-inch alloy wheels, climate control, semi-digital instrument cluster, cruise control, 7-inch touchscreen infotainment, eight-speaker Harman sound system and keyless entry with push start.The Altroz DCT will get a new Opera Blue paint shade and will also be available in the Dark styling package. The Altroz has a 5-star GlobalNCAP safety rating with safety features including dual airbags, ABS with EBD, rear parking sensors, and a parking camera. 2022 Tata Altroz DCT Prices, Rivals The top-spec Tata Altroz DCA XZA Plus Dark is priced at Rs 9.89 lakh while the mid-spec Altroz DCA XZA costs Rs 9.10 lakh. The Tata hatchback competes with the likes of the Hyundai i20 1.2-litre CVT, the Honda Jazz CVT as well as the Maruti Suzuki Baleno and Toyota Glanza AMT twins.

416, ps_abhijith , 17:52 ,BHPian,"Update on my Brothers Altroz Diesel : The car was around 6 months old and, and went in for the 15k km service. Brother has a bit high running because of his work. Apart from the slow, buggy and occasionally crashing head unit, everything else was apparently normal to us, the SVC called by evening (Focuz Kottayam), and informed that they have identified a serious issue with the car and they have already communicated the same to Tata Motors, and have ordered the replacement parts (Under warranty). Kudos to the service team for this, and the prompt response. I am pretty sure any other SVC around here would not have even identified the issue. (Personal experience with other SVCs around the area) So, the issue was they saw oil leaking from the clutch housing, which upon inspection turned out to be the input shaft seal of the gearbox being damaged (They did not give more details, or an explanation for how this happened). Oil was leaking from the gear box, and was dripping on to the clutch, and was leaking out through the bell housing. They communicated that they would not be replacing the gearbox as a whole, but would be replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, input shaft seal of the gearbox, and would drain out and fill new oil in the gearbox. The parts took around 2 weeks to arrive, and then the work was completed in 2 days. Brother was happy that the issue was identified on time, and more than happy to have a new clutch at 15k km. Cannot stress this anymore, please have the extended warranty on your cars. Overall this was a pleasant experience for us. We were charged around 1000 rs for the consumables for this work including the gear box oil and few other plugs/nuts/washers etc, which we were more than happy to pay for. We got a separate bill for the 15k service. About the issue, not sure if this is a common issue or just a one off case. Post the job, SVC had asked us to keep an eye out for any dripped oil marks on the parking area for a few weeks. It has been almost a month post this, and thankfully we have not noticed any oil leaks so far.", 3rd April 2022,tata-altroz,Cochin,120,540

I was expecting a noisy engine given the fact that Tata has done little do improve on NVH but was pleasantly surprised. The gearshifts were fairly smooth and the clutch, light.

What also surprised me was how stiff the steering felt in comparison to the lightness it had on the slow stretch. Took a U-turn and tried accelerating again to 80 kmph.

Yes its not a fault but its meant to be like that. Also lately I have been facing this recurrent issue with my Altroz.

It doesn't let you lock the car properly. And after 2-3 hours it triggers the panic alarm by itself. One has to go unlock-lock the car again.

Finally I settled for Graphene coating and did not go for PPF for reasons listed below: 1. PPF is too costly : to buy and to maintain (in case of replacement) 2. PPF will also have scratches down the line (after 3-4 years) 3. Not sure about how genuine are the products being offered by the installers. 4. I got Graphene coating done for 16.5 k with 5 year warranty and 3 maintenance / (if needed) complete re-coat in between. I found this a VFM deal.

454, freakmuzik , 23:42 ,BHPian,"I have had the opportunity to drive the Petrol (naturally aspirated) Altroz for quite some distance over the past couple of months. The primary car is my good friends', and another being one of another aquaitance in which we recently travelled through a set of very horrible roads+4 laned roads to places like Tada waterfalls and other parts around it. Wanted to share a few points which stood out for me: 1) Engine isn't a strong point but it absolutely isn't bad. 5 people + Luggage + AC - it easily climbs slippery slopes super easy. In very low revs esp in 1st & 2nd gear, there is a cabin shake/ judder as the clutch pedal is released - noticed this in both the examples of the Altroz (P). Didn't get a very positive feeling about the gearshift quality - there's something very unrefined about it in layman terms. But overall, the drivetrain does a very decent job. 2) Suspension is brilliant! It is a bit stiff in lower speeds but overall, it's superbly tuned and it tackled bad roads in decent speeds easily without rattling the occupants. Also, the ground clearance wasn't an issue on the worst of roads. Not once did it bottom out with 5 passengers on board. The stability is solid, steering is very precise & the brakes do a great job as well. 3) Seating and comfort - I loved the front seats but not the rear. The rear seats are too upright to relax and under-thigh support was a little lacking. Otherwise, legroom is great, Air-con is good and handrests are very useful too. For the driver, the dashboard is set a little high so I always preferred raising the seat height. 4) Infotainment has been really good. Apple Car Play and Android Auto worked seamlessly every single time and audio quality was really good even in the XT trim. For the very first time, I tried using Cruise control in a manual vehicle and it was interesting. I'm okay with the screen size. 5) Car no. 1 has run 6k kms - zero rattles + one or two tiny niggles. Car no. 2 has run 17.7 k kms and has been handled quite rougly - zero rattles. Absolutely loved the car as I drive it more and more. I would have loved if the engine were smoother and the cabin shake in low revs never existed. It doesn't fit in a 9L car or rather, any car in 2022. Along with it, a slightly more inclined rear seat would make such a huge difference to the rear seat comfort. Can't wait to drive the Diesel sometime soon!

Congrats on the purchase. Do you mean body roll while turning into corners or harshness that enters the cabin over potholes and bad roads? If it's the latter, the Altroz certainly has it in slow speeds, I'd say anything below 60-70 kmph. The car is much stiffer than the competition and it shows in the slow-speed ride quality. But, the upside is that it's stable at high speeds and is unfazed going over rumble strips in triple digit speeds. I think the Nexon's higher ground clearance and thicker tyres helps its ride quality. There's not much the service center can do about it. Which variant do you have? The top-spec variants have a lower profile of tyre which hurts the ride quality a little bit more.", 30th December 2022,tata-altroz,Bangalore,87,131

While they were good enough to give us LED lights, they saved some money by providing only one, but then they put it way ahead, towards the front, and for what, to save some more on wiring and cable routing? At the very least, it could have been placed a wee bit towards the rear. Regarding possible solutions, I went for the 2nd proposal from @NB_4763. Way easier, with no cutting and fumbling, but of course, no possibility of syncing with door switch. I bought one with an easy push-to-on/off switch off Amazon, USB rechargeable as well, and best thing is you can always get it off the metal plate (stuck on the roof) to use it as an emergency flashlight. It helps since it's pretty bright as well. I've many a time used it search for lost items near the footwell or boot (very weak single side bulb there). Only issue was the stock double-sided sticker that the item came with, which could never stand the hot temperature of the roof during our hot summer, and fell down every now and then after parking out in the open. I changed it to 3M automotive grade Double-Sided Attachment Tape, and now it's rock-solid.

B) Surprisingly the Tata dealer was actually good and was very proactive in follow ups and arranging for test drives which was very different in my experience with two different Tata dealers when I was buying my car. C) The features and fit and finish were best in class. The Kiger felt as premium but you needed to spend a bit more to get similar features as the Altroz.

It gives me immense pleasure to be a part of this community and am looking forward to share and read many interesting stories. Having used my 2nd hand WagonR (bought it to learn driving) for almost 2 years now, it's time I upgrade and buy my first new car. After much research, I have narrowed down on Altroz iTurbo. Need help with below points before I actually go and book it. 1. Does it make sense to buy one in 2023 over Kiger (my other shortlisted car) 2. Has anyone bought Tata cars via Wasan Tata? I have been given big promises of car delivery in 2 weeks, which I personally feel is being overdone just to make me book faster. 3. I have heard a lot about the quality of Tata service being a hit or miss. Has there been any improvement on this front? 4. If bought, this will be a long term vehicle. I know Altroz has been around for just three years, but I would like to know if the car is reliable? I ask this as I don't intend to drive in city and the car is most likely going to be used for Highway drives to my native with my Mother. Would hate to be stuck in the middle of highway with my mum.

The new 'XM+ (S)' trim is expected to be positioned between the 'XM+' and 'XT' trims and could be offered with all three powertrain options. The report also states that the XM+ (S) variant will get a few additional features over the XM+ trim. These include a shark fin antenna, a digital instrument cluster for the CNG version, a knitted roof liner and rain-sensing wipers. The Altroz XM+ (S) will be offered with the usual set of petrol and diesel engines.

Similar confusion is there with respect to their variant classification in website to brochure. Congratulations on booking your new car! I too have booked the Manual Transmission of the Altroz today. I initially thought to wait for the Sunroof (not a fan) and the shark fin antenna (preferred) to be added to the Petrol/Turbo variants but later figured out it would be best to save money rather than spending on features that are only pleasing to the eye for the initial few months and don't add any real value to the car or the driving experience. Certainly not a deal breaker. So I decided to book the regular iTurbo MT variant. Accessoeries: Please don't get me wrong here but maybe you seem to have overthought on the list of accessories you wish to add. Or maybe it's only me. I only got the Door visor and Mud flaps as an accessory as they prove to be utalitarian and i prefer to have them factory fitted rather than cheap aftermarket. Good thing you mentioned about the door edge guards. I should probable add those to my list too. I strongly recommend you to get the Anti-rust and silencer coating done from a good automotive shop that deals in detailing and other stuff, as you can watch them do it and be sure of the thickness of the layer applied as I have heard of instances where the showroom only apply a thin layer of these to the underbelly. However, if you trust your sales associate and the manager, then that should not be a problem. I'm sure the Service center is equally competent and equipped to put a nice coat of anti rust and silcencer coat. Coming to other accessories, I believe it will be wiser to spend on a ceramic coat for your car or getting it PPF'd so that it looks new for a longer time and saves your car from minor scratches. Nonetheless, I am very happy and excited to hear about your new car to arrive and wish you all the best and happy miles ", 27th May 2023,tata-altroz,Mumbai,9,6

I made a couple of calls to the details provided by Rhienhard and my friends who got their vehicles coated at 3M. Getting better deals. Also came to know from 3M directly that there are lot of complaints from a couple showroom including mine. All this is related to the claims that 3M coating is done on the car and 3M has found either no conclusive evidence of their genuine materials used or genuine materials used but not as advised. Eg. Silencer coating with 1/10 th usage guidelines. If 1 bottle is suggested for the vehicle, only 1/10 of the contents used on the problematic vehicle and rest might have been shared with other vehicles. In other cases, the materials used for ceramic coating are counterfeit ones, not genuine. A few having taken things legally it seems. So 3M representative requested me to exercise caution and ask for 3M guarantee certificate from dealership. When I made this request, the dealership gave vague replies like ""Trust us"" , ""We will guarantee "". I politely refused and planning to go with 3M genuine Showroom nearby with certification for 3 years. Let's see.", 29th May 2023,tata-altroz,Pune,96,410

Yeah that was my understanding too. I looked up on official Amaron/Exide website and third party sellers like batterybhai.com for my options. They do list out batteries with 60 AH(Altroz has 38Ah or 60AH batteries depending on the model) and bigger options. But none of them are EFB type. And its been mentioned more than once on the battery and the manual that we need to use the specific type. Hence I am trying to stick to it. Spoke to the customer support for Amaron and Exide who passed on the numbers for dealers in my city. The Exide dealer knew about the battery type but suggested that i should go for a regular 60AH battery as there was no supply. Also According to him the dimensions of the EFB battery is smaller than a regular 60AH. Which means there is a plate in the battery compartment that needs to be removed in case I am opting for the regular battery. Amaron Dealer had no clue about the battery type. I am quite surprised with the limited information available online and with official dealers about this battery considering other cars like Nexon are using the same battery type. Anyhow I managed to pull some strings and got the dealer to place an order for the exact same Amaron battery. It should arrive in 2 days.

515, Vivian.A34 , 03:43 ,Newbie,"It all started when my younger brother was searching for a car and I had to assist him with one. This was almost 10 months back when I was the only driver at home. you'll know how a middle class family works when you are the only car driving member in the family. The sleepless long drives when your entire family is dozzing off in the back seat. Anyways coming back to the topic so we started with Suzuki obviously because it is the most famous brand when you have budget less then 10 lakhs. We visited the Suzuki showroom in Nashik MIDC and I had suggested my brother Swift as it was quite popular in the hatchbacks. However I always had my 6th sense poking me saying no to Suzuki because of the bad safety ratings I have heard for Suzuki Xpresso and other cars they made. And just to let you'll know I use to drive my classic Ford Fiesta which was a gem of a car it was a 1.6L Duratec Petrol with a power which can even beat today's modern generation sedans, it was full of power and comfort and it was a 2006 model. I will write another post for my experience with my Ford. However I now own a KIA Sonet D 1.5 IMT again another post and review for my current IMT. My initial expression the SA was trying to push us towards wagonr and the new celerio I am not sure why but may be they had sales target for these car that month. But I was firm and asked my brother to only insist for Swift. They did not have a manual available for test drive so I tested the automatic petrol version also for some reason they insisted I drive in their parking lot only and not outside on the road it clipped me and I immediately felt something off with their SA and we had an immediate disconnect. I could not test the full potential of the vehicle because of this incident and we left the showroom. I am assuming it was a delivery vehicle for some customer and they did not want to show kms on the ODO. Next up we went to Sterling Motors near Dwarka in Nashik the SA was quite good and welcoming he immediately adjusted a test drive vehicle and we are off doing a test drive. First up the looks of the car are amazing the curves and the body structure you will know the engineers have put a lot of effort in designing the exterior of this car and it is a piece of art. Similarly the interior is equally mesmerizing with the ambient lighting and other loaded features which you usually get in a car above 10 lakhs with good hard plastic and fiber used only where required and still it did not felt cheap inside the car. It was heavy traffic that day hence I could not drive freely so we insisted we get another test drive the next day during noon hours when there is less traffic the SA was okay with it. Me and my brother were on time the next day at 1pm for a test drive and this time I took it for a good 15mins ride initial expression the car had less power then my Ford and that was understood as this was a 1.2 NA Petrol and the eco mode was anyways designed to have less power and more efficiency however I was expecting more from the city mode but that mode also did not please me. But then my brother was going to be learner driver hence I was okay with his car having less power and more of safety. Comfort wise the seats are adjustable for height and position so it was good, the visibility from the cabin was good only durin right turn the A pillar was blocking the view subsequently this could have been better. Atat Altroz XZ model which we were eyeing at comes with R16 so the ground clearance was good. Harman music system is a cherry on top with its crystal clear output and bass levels upto the mark it makes the Altroz a complete car. We were suppose to check out the i20 but we decided that Altroz it is as me and my brother had a common opinion on the new looks of the i20 and it did not pleased us also it was more expensive then the Altroz. Ford which was already out of market hence Figo was never there in our checklist however I still wonder if Ford was still available then it would have been a difficult choice for us. We booked the car and now the waiting period started for the delivery the SA told it will 1month but the car arrived in 20 days we did a PDA at their warehouse we had booked the opera blue colour. Delivery experience was great 11th Nov 2022 the car was ready for delivery the SA explained my brother about the whereabouts as per their standard process and also helped us with the paperwork swiftly. Dec 22 we made a trip to Indore in the new Altroz the car performed beautifully on rough roads and speed bumps. There was not many jerks and the suspension is accurately built for the Altroz to sustain impacts. Steering is comfortable and weighs adequately and gives a sense of control on speeds above 100kmh. It gave me a good average of 19kmpl on highway with all the traffic and bad roads near Dhule. I felt the engine could have been more peppy as I felt the car gives up after it crosses 120kmh. Maybe I am asking more from a 1.2 NA but then Altroz is a full size hatchback it did need a peppier engine. Doors are heavy and it feels the car is built with strong metal. Automatic climate control AC is good not as good as my KIA but does the job nicely. Weight distribution of the car is good and you do not feel the centrifugal force pushing you harshly here and there on high speeds. Overall I would rate the car a 7 out of 10 only because of the engine. P.S Tata still needs to work on their customer service reps at the service center as they are still not trained to handle passenger car customers. Tata will lose its ground if they do not improve on their customer service skills they are making excellent vehicles but only because of their customer service they will lose it.", 17th August 2023,tata-altroz,Nasik,3,25

They had to call the patrol police to help them open the car (you can watch the video below). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhkKOX5s-Rw My friend has some questions: 1. My friend has left the key inside before several times without this problem. So, we're wondering why it happened this time. 2. Before they left the car, they noticed the inside light wouldn't turn off, even when they tried. You can see it in the video.

If the car service connects a computer to it now, will it show any error messages? 4. Has anyone else had this happen? We'd like to know if it's something unusual with Altroz alone or is it a electronics fault that can happen to any brand. P.S. We've already told our friend to be more careful with the key, keep a glass breaker tool in pocket, or use a phone app to lock/unlock it and he is very frustrated with the experience and the irritating free advice on top of it from all of us .

I'm not sure if this is the case, but one potential issue with these smart keys is that a low key battery could make the car think the key is outside. This, in turn, may lead to auto-locking. As the battery nears low, the key detection strength will decrease. The low key battery warning would only show up later when it hits a certain threshold.

I didn't mean ancient in a bad way, After driving swift and micra diesel for a good part of last decade, when i test drove the altroz, the interior and build quality felt like a generation ahead. However, the engine and gear box in the diesel variant felt like an older generation. Altroz is such a wonderful product, it deserves the 1.5 Diesel mill in Nexon's state of tune, with either a 6 speed MT or atleast an AMT. I understand there are price and technical constraints for not having these.

However just rethink investment into Diesels, especially after the recent announcements/ rumours / press conference given by the Govt. Prasanna's thread on Altroz Diesel is a beautiful guideline. If nothing is going to deter your will, you will have no regrets with your purchase of a diesel Altroz. With your running, you will be having your RoI very early.

Hi Praneeth, Altroz diesel is a wonderful car at 12L. It's as fast as a 1.5 TDI and as efficient too. You will be surprised by the excellent highspeed dynamics too. I have the same usage as yours. I am happy with the altroz diesel (56,000 km in about 22 months), but I am also contemplating about going Electric, altroz diesel will stay + Tiago ev is in the plan. Tiago LR EV at 11 lakhs on road is a compelling package. Claimed range is 315 km but in real world you get anywhere between 150-200 km per full charge. You had informed you don't have charging infra at your home. If there is a way, do check. Running cost of about 1 rs per km vs 5rs per km of altroz diesel. Plus it's super quiet and effortless to drive in traffic too. But as a primary car/ only car, it won't work.

531, Stupaq25 , 16:37 ,Newbie,"Hello BHPians, This is my first post and here Im going to share my experience of 1 year with my Altroz 1.2 N.A petrol XZ. Were a family of Tata fans with my fathers Tiago XZ Plus and brothers Nexon XZ Plus, so I may sound a bit biased. I was looking for a spacious car within 10 lacs OTR. Body types were not an issue but both me and my wife wanted a petrol car with manual gearbox. Since my father in law had an Alto (now replaced with a Celerio) and my father has a facelift Tiago, we wanted a slightly bigger car, with a focus on rear seat comfort. The cars we considered were: 1. Tigor 2. Punch 3. Nexon 4. Altroz 5. XUV 300 6. I 20 7. Amaze 8. Baleno/Glanza 9. Brezza 10. Kushaq/Taigun 11. Magnite/Kiger Among these, - Tigor was ruled out as soon as we test drove the car. Its all the same like Tiago - Punch was also ruled out because of narrowed rear seats. However I liked the reclining of Punch - Nexon was opted out mainly because of smaller parking space in my apartment as Ive to accommodate my Suzuki Access 125 as well. However I really loved Nexon as I test drove - XUV 300 (W6) was out of our budget and the boot space was also smaller - i20, Baleno/Glanza and Brezza were omitted due to lack of a good GNCAP rating - Honda Amaze, Renault Kiger and Nissan Magnite were also omitted because at that time (September -October 2022), there were adverse media speculations regarding their India operations - Kushaq/Taigun duo were rejected because of budget and the notorious service costs of Skoda/Volkswagen. Finally, it was all about Altroz N.A Petrol vs Turbo Petrol. The GNCAP rating, features, riding comfort and looks (although subjective) were key deciding factors. We took test drive of both the cars and immediately liked its driving comfort. In fact, the first thing I liked was its steering response, both in n.a and turbo powertrains. Sure, the turbo engine is more fun to drive, but the naturally aspirated engine is not bad either, for a sedate driver like me, as most of the driving is in city (my office, wifes school, occasional visit to malls/movies on weekends, occasional outstation trips etc.). So after a lot of discussion with my wife, my father and my brother I finally decided to go with the Altroz XZ naturally aspirated petrol. As a Union Govt. Officer currently based in Kolkata, BH number series seemed prudent to opt for and my final OTR price came out as ₹.8.78 lacs (including accessories). So, we booked our Altroz from Dulichand Motors, Anandapur, Kolkata on November 25, 2022. Initial colour option Opera Blue was replaced by Downtown Red, although I personally liked the Avenue White most. We took delivery on December 22, 2022 and as on today (27.12.2023) Ive driven 11650 km, (anniversary odometer  11317 km) which includes a Kolkata  Puri roadtrip during Durga Puja, 2023 and a few trips to my native place in Bankura district, West Bengal. 11000 km in a year is not bad for a new driver. Except the engine refinement and initial acceleration, Ive faced no issue so far. Yes the gearbox was a bit stiff, but after 10000 km, its become smoother. Regarding mileage, Im getting between 15-17 kmpl in city traffic in Kolkata and 22-24 kmpl on highway (with AC being switched off most of the time). During my Puri road trip, Ive had managed to get 25.5 kmpl as the best mileage figure, with AC being turned on occasionally. What adds more pleasure to the highway drives is the punchy Harman 4 speakers + 2 twitters sound system. Its so beautiful and better than Glanza, I 20. But yes, additional 2 twitters (as with XZ Plus) generates a more balanced output, as in my car, higher volume translates into slight distortion. One more thing, despite having a low ground clearance, the body roll problem is very much there in Altroz. So cornering is not always a cakewalk. Ive rotated the tyres while checking the wheel balance and alignment post 8500 km completion and had to change the brake pad as it was heavily damaged. Im also thinking to replace the OEM MRF ZVTV tyres (195/55 R16) post completion of 20000 km, with either of the following ones: MRF Perfinza, Continental UC6 and Yokohama Blue Earth GT; as the ZVTV tyres produce a lot of cabin noise, and the braking is not that great. Overall, the Altroz n.a petrol is a very good family car. But a slightly more powerful and refined engine would have been great. Heard that the BS6-II engine has reduced the NVH to a great extent, and delivers slightly more power, but Im yet to test drove that updated engine. Regarding the initial pick up issue, Ive talked with tuners in Kolkata for a ECU stage 1 remapping, but have not decided yet whether I should go with it. One thing I would like to see improved is the service centre experience. Tata Motors needs to seriously look into it. In fact, if showroom/service centre experience is concerned, Ive the best experience with Toyota (I visited Topsel Toyota, Anandapur, Kolkata, just beside Dulichand and their service centre is conveniently located on the same premises). Toyota guys are so professional and knowledgeable. If Toyota rolls out a good car with a good BNCAP rating, who knows my next car will be from Toyota. Regards!

There is a leakage in AC suction pipe which needs replacement & price quoted is 5500/-.

Tata is offering upto 75000 offers on Altroz this month. This is the pic shared by Trichy Kaveri Tata. I don't think individual dealers would give such huge discounts. Tata must have sent a circular regarding March offers (given the end of financial year by 31st March). Also, BS6.2 engine is very noticeably refined.", 13th March 2024,tata-altroz,TRICHY,"2,919","18,294"

Probably TATA want to clearup the existing stock engines before 6.2 hits the market. Otherwise it'll become difficult for them to push older engines in the presence of newer and more refined ones!, 14th March 2024,tata-altroz,Bangalore,9,4

BS6.2 has been selling for about 6 months now IIRC., 14th March 2024,tata-altroz,TRICHY,"2,919","18,294"

Tata has upgraded their 1.2L revotron engine to BS6.2 way back in March 2023. We bought a Tigor in May that came with a BS6.2 engine. , 15th March 2024,tata-altroz,Madras,793,"2,825"

We bought a Tigor in May that came with a BS6.2 engine. Got a call from another Tata Motors dealer from Kundanahalli, Whitefield area. Even they claimed they are getting BS6.2 engines from last Nov itself. How's your experience with BS6.2 w.r.t NVH levels compared to earlier lower versioned engines of TATAs if in case you have driven them? And about overall engine performance?", 15th March 2024,tata-altroz,Bangalore,9,4

I have driven the the 1st gen Tiago with the original 1.2L revotron for quite a bit. Compared to that the BS6.2 is much more refined and slightly quieter. Also while comparing to the BS6.1 Altroz I have driven earlier the BS6.2 Altroz DCA I drove recently felt nicer.", 16th March 2024,tata-altroz,Madras,793,"2,825"
