0, Aditya , 09:48 ,Team-BHP Support,"The Mahindra XUV300 is on sale in India at a price of between Rs. 7.90 - 11.99 lakhs. What you'll like: • A truly premium crossover. Nice build, quality & refinement levels • Great looking! Smart design has none of the usual Mahindra quirkiness • Cabin has enough space for 5. Quality-wise, the interior is more like a Hyundai • Fantastic engines. The petrol & diesel, both, offer fast performance & good driveability • A compliant ride with neutral road manners • 5-star NCAP rating & kit. 7 airbags, ESP, ABS, all-wheel disc brakes, TPMS, seatbelt reminders for all & more • Loaded to the gills with equipment (front parking sensors, sunroof, cruise control, auto headlamps & wipers etc) What you won't: • The most expensive Compact SUV in India! Not overpriced, but definitely higher than expected • 257-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. There are cheaper hatchbacks which have a larger boot • Concerns over niggles in a freshly baked Mahindra. Our test car itself had issues • Lack of a proper middle variant. W6 trim is simply too bare-bones, while W8 is expensive! • No automatic option in a market that is moving toward ATs • Mahindra's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble • Some important features missing (dead pedal, parcel tray, rear air-con, steering reach adjustment etc) The 2021 1.2L Petrol Automatic (AMT) • Link to Review This review has been jointly compiled with Vid6639 & Suhaas307.

2, Aditya , 09:49 ,Team-BHP Support,"Exterior Our early 2019 sales charts reveal that seven out of the ten top sellers in the C2 segment are either SUVs or crossovers! Maruti's Vitara Brezza has been a regular visitor on the top 10 cars list of the country. The Ford EcoSport is a good performer too, as are the Honda WR-V & Tata Nexon. Mahindra has had presence in the 10-lakh SUV space too. However, their vehicles have all been old-school SUVs with body-on-frame constructions. This limited their appeal, as most urban buyers today prefer more modern monocoque-based crossovers which are car-like to drive. The XUV300, which is based on the SsangYong Tivoli, will be the company's first C2 segment SUV with a monocoque construction. The most important job for Mahindra was to chop the rear & bring the car's length to under 4-meters for tax savings. SsangYong has sold more than 2,60,000 units of the Tivoli in more than 50 countries since its launch in 2015. By the look of things, the XUV300 seems to have started off well too. Our sales chart shows that Mahindra sold 4,484 & 4,742 units of the car in the initial 2 months of production. Because it's based on the Tivoli, Mahindra saved big bucks in bringing the car here, as compared to developing a car from the ground up. We wish that Mahindra had done an ""XUV500"" with the pricing. When the XUV500 was launched, it was priced so well that the market response exceeded all expectations! With the XUV300, no one will say that. As the most expensive Compact SUV in the segment, most people feel that it's premium-priced, while some BHPians even feel that it's overpriced. Fit & finish are better than other Mahindra vehicles – in fact, they are among the best in this segment. The car is solidly built with 68% high strength steel in its construction and the doors, tailgate and bonnet have a good deal of weight to them. There's barely any flex if you press the door metal with your thumb. The vehicle's kerb weight of 1,296 kg for the petrol and 1,360 kg for the diesel makes it heavier than all other monocoque sub-4 meter rivals...and even some larger ones like the Creta! The paint quality is as good as we’ve seen in the segment. To power the XUV300, Mahindra have used the 1.5L, 4-cylinder turbocharged diesel that was first seen in the Marazzo. A 1.2L, 3-cylinder turbocharged petrol is also available. Both powerplants are mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox. While there is no automatic option on offer at the moment, an AMT is expected in the short-term. Some rumours insist that a proper torque-converter AT is planned for later. Coming to safety, the XUV300 is equipped with dual front airbags, ABS + EBD, ISOFIX child seat mounts, impact-sensitive door locks and all-round disc brakes as standard. The top variant also gets 7 airbags, 3-point seatbelts for all seats, front parking sensors and seatbelt reminders for the rear seat! Mahindra has not equipped the car with an audible speed warning (yet). However, you do get a visual warning on the instrument cluster, albeit at a speed no one is expected to drive at. Additionally, you get TPMS, tyre position display and a reversing camera. While the XUV300 has not been crash tested by independent entities like the NCAP, the SsangYong Tivoli got a Grade 1 (highest) safety award in the 2015 KNCAP (Korean New Car Assessment Program) test. It also obtained a 4-star rating in crash tests conducted by the Euro NCAP in 2016. Anand Mahindra had publicly congratulated Tata for the Nexon's 5-star safety rating & we think Mahindra will be gunning for the same with the XUV300. Mahindra is offering a standard warranty of 2 years / unlimited km, which can be extended to 5 years / 150,000 km. We strongly recommend this extension as brand-new Mahindras are known to have niggles in the early batches. There has already been a problem with faulty shock absorbers in this car (even our test car was affected by it!!!). Thankfully, this is one Mahindra design without any quirkiness. Slim grille flanked by projector headlamps. Prominent air dam, LED DRLs and its width give the car good road presence. Chrome is used on the grille and air dam, but somehow, doesn't appear overdone: Smart rear end, but its more ""hatchback"" than SUV. LED tail-lamps appear to stick out from the sides. Tailgate features prominent cuts and creases. Use of chrome is limited to the badges. Exhaust pipe is barely visible. Faux skid plate is huge and adds to the character: The XUV300 is based on SsangYong's X100 platform; while the Korean car measures more than 4 meters in length, the Mahindra has been shortened to suit the Indian market. We do get the feeling that larger bumpers could give the car a more complete look. Still, I really liked the looks & stance of the XUV300. Side body cladding, large wheels and roof rails enhance its crossover appearance. Note the blackened A, B & C pillars: One of the best angles to view the XUV300 from. It has a wheelbase of 2,600 mm, which is the longest in the segment. Its 1,821 mm width makes it the widest car in the segment too: While there are some prominent cuts and creases on the sides, they don't seem overdone and gel nicely with the overall design. Just see that prominent rear haunch! Ladies found this Sunburst Orange colour of our test car ""sexy"". We loved it too: Headlamp clusters of the W8 & W8 (O) variants have black and chrome inserts. Low beam projectors are regular halogens. Follow-me-home and lead-me-to-vehicle functions have been provided. DRLs are integrated in the headlamp cluster and run on the top as well as the sides. They extend down onto the bumper, which is unique: With all the lights in action: DRLs are bright and prominent, even during the day: Piano black grille features a large Mahindra badge, a chrome strip on the top and multiple small chrome inserts as seen in the XUV500. The chrome strip on the top merges with the LED DRLs in the headlamp clusters. Overall, the grille is slim & chic: Front bumper is dominated by the large air dam with four horizontal chrome slats and a silver skid plate. The DRLs appear to connect the headlamp clusters to the foglamps, which have piano black housings: Small halogen foglamps provide adequate illumination. Cornering lamp function is not provided. Parking sensors are located below them, close to the corners of the bumper. When you are driving in the city and go too close to a car, the parking sensors will warn you. It’s probably a good thing considering the width of the car: Front towing point is neatly integrated in the air dam: Small, silver plastic skid plate adds to the SUV'ish look, but it is obviously not functional. There is a good deal of underbody protection - necessary since the unladen ground clearance of the car is 180 mm. Sufficient, yet the lowest in the segment: Long bonnet features a wide and largely flat central dome, while the prominent creases on the side give it some muscle: The XUV300 is equipped with automatic rain-sensing wipers. The sensor is located in the center of the windshield: Old-school wiper blades. We were hoping the XUV300 got aero wiper blades like the Marazzo (link): Windshield washers are hidden under the bonnet. Each unit shoots out water through three nozzles: Big wipers have a good sweep: Shut lines are tight & uniform - the best we have seen on a Mahindra car: However, they get wider around the bonnet... ...and tailgate: Dual-tone body colour + black ORVMs with integrated turn-indicators. Notice the subtle chrome insert around the blinker. The ORVMs don't move the other way. They could get damaged if a biker side-swipes them. Surprising miss by Mahindra as almost all cars today offer India-friendly ORVMs: W8 and W8 (Optional Pack) variants get this request sensor on both front door handles. Simply walk up to the car with the key on your person and touch the request sensor to lock / unlock. Keyhole is provided only on the driver's door: Roof slopes down towards the rear. A, B & C-pillars are blacked out, giving a floating roof effect. Looking at the roof section reminds us of the Mini Cooper in some ways: C-pillar is thick and has a shiny black panel which merges with the rear windshield. Notice the vertical crease on it: Just look at the beefed up wheel arches! Similarly, there's a prominent haunch that originates on the rear door and runs across the rear panel, merging into the tail-lamp. You can see this in the ORVM Front tyres get aero flaps ahead of them: Black plastic cladding runs along the wheel arches. W8 (Optional Pack) variant gets the FUNKY 17"" black and silver diamond cut rims shod with 215/55 MRF Wanderer tyres. They fill up the wheel wells nicely. Like the Vitara Brezza, these get 5 lugnuts. W8 variant gets different 17"" alloy wheels, while lower variants get 16"" steel rims, with 205/65 section tyres: Prominent crease runs low on the doors. Black cladding for that crossover look! Cladding extends all the way down to the frame of the XUV300. Corners haven't been cut with this car: Subtle protrusion on the cladding of the rear wheel arch acts as a splash guard: Disc brakes are provided on all four wheels of the XUV300 - a segment first: Like other sub-4 meter cars, the rear bumper doesn't protrude out and the rear looks chopped off (which it is actually). A rear impact will easily dent the tailgate: W8 (Optional Pack) variant gets a very-welcome sunroof. The other two to offer a sunroof in this segment are the EcoSport & WR-V: W8 (Optional Pack) variant gets dual-tone roof rails (cosmetic only), while W8 and W6 variants get black units. W4 base variant has none: Stubby antenna sits at the rear of the roof. A shark-fin unit isn't available, even as an accessory: Tailgate gets a neatly integrated spoiler, which houses an LED HMSL: Windshield washer is neatly integrated in the spoiler: Split tail-lamp clusters have an LED outline for the pilot cum stop lamp (all others are halogen): With all the lights in action: When the brakes are applied, the LED strip becomes brighter and the lights above the turn-indicator and reversing lamp glow. Love the attention-to-detail: Number plate is housed in a large recessed area on the tailgate. Rear windshield is proportionately sized. We appreciate that a chrome strip has NOT been slapped on: Only the W8 and W8 (O) variants get rear wash & wipe and defogger. Quite stupid from the safety POV: Reversing camera is tucked away, above the number plate with the electromagnetic boot release next to it: Yes to variant badging, no to engine badging (anywhere on the body): Like the front bumper, the rear one is a dual-tone unit too. It houses two foglamps, four parking sensors and a large silver skid plate: Rear towing-point cap has an arrow indicating where you should press to remove it: Twist beam suspension with coil springs at the rear. Mahindra has said that a particular batch of dampers was defective. Our test car was one of the vehicles with these defective shock absorbers & it resulted in dangerous high speed behaviour. If you've bought an XUV300, I would strongly recommend that you call your dealer & check if your car is affected. Exhaust pipe peeps out from a cutout in the silver skid plate: Shot at the Mumbai-Pune mega meet (link). XUV300 looks boxier and edgier than the more rounded and funky Ford EcoSport. We like the styling of both! Tailgate-mounted spare gives the EcoSport a more SUVish look than the XUV300's hatchback-like rear: Both are among the best lookers from this segment IMHO: XUV300's body line is more conventional than the coupe-like Nexon. The Mahindra will appeal to most, while the funky Nexon will divide opinions: ", 15th April 2019,mahindra-xuv300,Mumbai,"17,609","76,005",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
3, Aditya , 09:49 ,Team-BHP Support,"Interior - Front The front doors open and shut in a triple-stage action. As mentioned earlier, they have a fair amount of weight to them. There is a good thud when you shut them. The doors don't close easily and need to be pushed hard at times. They open wide enough and the running board is not excessively wide. The floor of the car is at a comfortable height, while the roof is on the higher side. Thus, it's very easy to step in and out. Once inside, the XUV300 offers sufficient legroom & headroom at the front. The front windshield is large, but the roofline slopes downwards and I found the rear windshield + windows to be on the smaller side. Still, there is enough light entering the cabin to keep occupants from feeling claustrophobic. The use of beige on the dashboard, doorpads, seats, pillars and roof helps matters. Except for the long gearshift, this feels more like a mini-Creta than a Mahindra! Reminds one of a Hyundai in many ways. Even if you look at the steering design, its very similar to what we have seen in some Hyundais. The XUV300 feels like a top quality package the minute you get in. As expected for this segment, the plastics on the dashboard are all hard, yet their quality is better than the main rivals in the segment. It's even superior to the more expensive XUV500! Almost every part is well-finished and there are barely any rough edges. The seats get leatherette (artificial leather) upholstery and there is some leather applied on the doorpads as well. The dashboards styling is functional, and there is no ""wow"" factor. It has a beige & black theme with silver inserts, while piano black has been used on the center fascia (climate control panel) and air-con vents. While the lower part of the dashboard is beige, the carpets and floor mats are thankfully black. This is cleverly thought out as they will do well to conceal any signs of soiling. Ergonomically, the cabin is well laid out and all controls are easy to find and reach. The feel, quality and finish of most of the buttons / switches is good: Windscreen is huge and offers a good view of the road ahead. The seating position is a little high up, but it's more like a tall hatchback than an SUV. Owners will appreciate that they can view the bonnet while driving. Not only the bonnet...you can also see the contours on its sides! Smart leather-wrapped steering wheel has a perforated pattern, silver inserts and thumb contours. Design is very Hyundai-like. It is sufficiently thick and feels great to hold, with adequate grip on offer. The steering-mounted controls have large buttons, which makes their operation easy. The hornpad isn't easy to reach for those with shorter thumbs, but is easy to press: Buttons for the infotainment system and telephony are placed on the left spoke. Mute function (very useful) has a dedicated button which has to be long pressed. The track change and mode buttons are terrible to use. Several times, one ends up changing the source instead of the track (we frequently went from Bluetooth to radio). It doesnt have a tactile feel. Buttons for operating the cruise control and voice commands are placed on the right spoke: Zooming in to show you the very-consistent stitching pattern on the steering: While the finishing is very good at most places, the top of the hornpad has a rough, unfinished edge: Steering can be adjusted for height only, not reach - even in the top spec! This is a major omission as a reach-adjustable steering greatly contributes to the 'perfect' driving position. Any car with premium aspirations MUST have this. It must be noted that the Ford EcoSport, which was the car that started the sub-4 meter SUV segment, comes with telescopic adjustment: Engine start/stop button has a chrome ring around it. If you press the engine start/stop button without pressing the clutch, a red light glows (""ignition on"" mode). When you press the clutch, a green light comes on. Press the button to start the engine and the light goes off: Simple instrument cluster is easy to read. Tachometer on the left & speedometer on the right (just the way we prefer it) with a 3.5"" TFT MID in between, with the digital fuel and temperature gauges. Meters have red outlines, and red parallel rings running on the inside too. We like how the redline is marked differently. While the tachometer of the petrol is marked till 8,000 rpm... ...the revv counter of the diesel is marked till 6,000 rpm: The MID shows an odometer, dual trip meters, time, outside temperature, average and instant fuel consumption, a distance-to-empty counter and digital speedometer. The trip meters show their own average speed and driving time (individually). The selected gear is displayed as well (pointless IMHO). When the MID is in the digital speedometer mode, long pressing the ""set"" button (weirdly placed on the center fascia) will turn the illumination of the instrument cluster including the needles, rings and numerals on / off. So basically, you can drive with only the digital speedometer & MID showing: The MID throws up a number of warnings. Upon switching the car on - if the front wheels are in a turned position - the system warns you accordingly (see the Hyundai influence?). There is a warning for an open sunroof if the engine is switched off, service reminder and seatbelt reminder for both the front seat occupants. It also displays the specific door that is open. We appreciate that a bonnet-open warning has been included (this is rarely ever seen in cars). There is a parking sensor display for the front as well as the rear: If the bonnet is left open, the MID shows the car's bonnet flashing. The hazard lamps start flashing as well. Excellent attention-to-detail! MID settings can only be changed when the car is stationary. The colour of the inner rings of the meters can be changed (separately for day / night if you find the red too bright), along with the brightness levels of the cluster. The overspeed flash is a visual warning wherein, the inner rings of the speedometer start flashing when the car touches 160 km/h. You can disable the welcome sound too: You can choose between red... ...yellow (yuck!)... ...sky blue... ...dark blue... ...and white (the only one we'll consider): The illumination of the inner ring can be turned off as well (our top choice & incidentally, all the colours of the Team-BHP logo): Very busy stalks. Wiper and light stalks give positive feedback and are great to use. Foglamp switch is integrated on the light stalk itself. Auto headlamps and auto rain-sensing wipers work like a charm. A lane change indicator is present. See the second 'auto' setting on the left (silver button)? That's for one-touch washing & wiping of the windscreen! Press it once and water will be sprayed for 2 seconds, then the windshield will be wiped 4 times. After that again, the washer fluid will be sprayed for 1.5 seconds & the wipers engage for 3 seconds. Mist feature is provided as well. Rear wiper has two speed settings. The silver button on the light stalk is a dummy unit: Side air-conditioner vent has a piano black surround with a silver border, and a chrome tip on the air flow direction controller. The air flow volume can be regulated as well. In the ""OFF"" position, absolutely NO air flows out of the vent (again shows attention to quality): Buttons to disable the traction control system (don't ever do this in India), idling start-stop system (recommended) and front parking sensors are here. Note that switching the parking sensors off will only stop the warning beeps from the front parking sensors. The visual warnings continue to be displayed. The three blanks give an impression that something is missing in an otherwise loaded car: Fusebox is located low on the dashboard: White OBD port is located at its base: J-shaped bonnet release lever is easy to hold. It is sturdy & well-finished: Fuel flap release lever is located on the floor and sticks out of the carpet. Floor mat should have featured a cut-out (as seen in other cars) for easy removal: Like the dashboard, the doorpads get a black + beige colour theme with a piano black insert. The beige portion is at the middle and lower down. It's sure to get soiled with time. The doorpads are well finished with no sharp edges anywhere. Notice how the speaker is placed in the upper half: W8 and W8 (O) variants get chrome door handles. While the handle itself is sturdy, the lock/unlock lever feels flimsy. Lesser variants get black door handles. A small usability add-on  the kind of things that make a big difference on a day-to-day basis  if you want to open the drivers door, you just have to pull on the handle (no need to unlock via the lever first): While all the plastics are hard, there is a soft, leather pad where the driver's elbow will rest: Good-looking silver buttons for the power windows and ORVMs. They're housed in a piano black panel. Action of the power window buttons is clicky & flimsy. They dont feel robust either. Only the driver's window gets one-touch up / down & anti-pinch. The windows also have an 'extended operation' feature wherein, you can operate them for a while even after the car's engine has been switched off. Useful to catch any window that's been left open. ORVMs get the auto-folding function on lock / unlock. Switches for the windows are illuminated in orange, which seems so yesterday! Exposed screw on the doorpad looks ugly and out of place in an otherwise good interior. Should have been covered up with a cap: Door pockets are deep, but thin. They can hold 2 bottles and some knick-knacks: Both front doors get red warning lights: Door sills aren't too wide, which means lesser effort to move your feet in & out of the car. Black scuff plates provided: Front seats are draped in off-white leatherette upholstery...how incredibly silly for India! These will get dirty within a week of ownership - what was Mahindra thinking? Because of the airbags, owners can't even put seat covers over these. Lower variants get more practical black seats. Seats are wide enough to suit even larger drivers. While the under-thigh and shoulder support offered is enough, lower back support is ordinary. Lumbar adjustment is missing and those with a delicate back are likely to complain. The seats have something that Mahindra calls ""dual stiffness foam"" in them, but I felt they could have been firmer, which would have made them more suitable for longer drives. The headrests are adjustable, but are on the firmer side. A convenient center armrest has been provided as well: Sturdy levers to recline the seat and adjust its height: Solid metal lever for fore & aft movement: Fore & aft travel is good enough to allow even drivers with a laidback driving position to be comfortable: Healthy range for the seat height adjustment. Short or tall, no one will complain. Even the headroom is enough - with the driver's seat at its highest position, I @ 5'10"" had about an inch of headroom to spare: The leatherette upholstery is well stitched and the quality of material is good. Notice the perforated design pattern (it's fake, of course). Just wish a more sensible colour was chosen: Front seatbelts are height-adjustable: Front seatbelts get pretensioners. Like the Marazzo, the pretensioners are exposed units: One of the rare cars in which the brake pedal is almost at the same height as the accelerator pedal. Usually, the difference is more. Additionally, the accelerator is too close to the brake pedal. There will be some times when you intend to press only the brake pedal, but youll press the brake + accelerator at the same time!!! This is a design failure for those with a large shoe size. No dead pedal provided: ORVMs are sufficiently wide, but could have been taller towards the outer ends. W8 (O) gets heated ORVMs which can be used to get rid of mist. An incredibly sweet touch  from the ORVMs, you can see the muscular haunches of the rear wheel arches (like in sports cars). The only other car I remember seeing this is in is the new Swift: IRVM is wide enough to cover the entire rear windshield. Thick C-pillars restrict visibility though: IRVM gets the auto-dimming function. While it is ""ON"" by default, it can be switched off by pressing a button. When it is active, a green light glows: Sensor for the 'automatic headlamps' is located behind the IRVM (basically, facing the road ahead): While reversing, the rearward view is just average. The rear windshield is short in height and the C-pillars are thick. Better to rely on the reversing camera and parking sensors: Center fascia gets a combination of shiny piano black and silver inserts around the ICE and air-con vents. Piano black has been used on the climate control panel as well: A look at the dash area, on top of the center console. Just a design, although one gets the impression that a storage compartment has been left out: 7"" touchscreen head-unit sits at the top of the center fascia. Its functions are covered in a separate post. A silver casing runs around the entire unit: Buttons to operate the rear defogger, hazard lights, MID (weird placement for MID here) and steering modes are located below the ICE. Seatbelt reminder lamps for ALL passengers (including 5th) are placed here as well: Dual-zone climate control system, a first in segment feature, has 3 memory settings (three different sets of temperatures can be memorised)!! The blower has 8 levels of adjustment. It starts getting loud on levels 4 and 5, while on levels 6, 7 & 8, it is annoyingly loud. Best to keep it at level 3. The lowest temperature that the system goes to is 18 degrees centigrade before hitting LO, while the highest is 32 degrees before hitting HI. Air-conditioning is not as chilling as we have seen in some other cars. It is strictly average on a blazing summer day. At the front, it is just about adequate; at the rear, things can get warm as there are no rear vents & the front unit is so average on a hot day. Our petrol test car's climate control system had a bug. Whenever the engine was revved hard, the cooling would stop. However, this problem disappeared after restarting the car (we didn't face this problem in the diesel). Another complaint we have is that the display has a dated look and the buttons are thin, making them difficult to operate: Aux-in and a pair of illuminated USB ports are located below the climate control system. While the USB port on the left is for charging devices, the one on the right allows you to connect your smartphone for Android Auto / Apple CarPlay: 12V power socket is located at the base of the center fascia, along with a storage space for your smartphone. It has a rubber lining on the surface for protection: Bird's eye view of the center console. Armrest is not adjustable, but it is placed at a comfortable height and has a soft leather cladding. Handbrake is heavy to operate: Two cupholders are located to the left of the handbrake. Each gets 3 grips to hold the cup in place. Good attention to detail: Center armrest has a deep storage compartment underneath. Its strange shape can reduce its versatility. Floor has a soft lining: Cut-outs in the front wall and lid allow one to store a tablet in the storage compartment: Along with the dual-tone colour theme, strong creases keep things from getting boring on the passengers side of the dashboard: Long and fairly deep storage space above the glovebox. One can keep odd items here. Has a partition (left of the smartphone) to keep things from falling: Glovebox is medium-sized. Light is active only at night (when the pilot lamps are on). Cooling vent missing (mentioning since the car is otherwise so loaded): Glovebox lid gets a compartment to store the owner's manual of the car: Roof bezel consists of map lights, a sunglass holder and sunroof controls. After locking the car, all cabin lights go out with a theatre-dimming effect: Sunglass holder has a soft opening action and a protective lining on the inside to prevent your sunglasses from getting scratched: Spring-loaded grab handle above the passenger door. There's none on the driver's side: Bluetooth mic is located above the driver's sunvisor. It should have been integrated in the roof lamp console for a cleaner look IMHO: Sunvisors are well built. Both units get a slot to hold tickets... ...and illuminated vanity mirrors with a lid. No cost cutting in this car: Dual airbags are standard on all variants of the XUV300. W8 (O) trim is the only SUV in the C2 segment that gets 7 airbags in total!!! These include ...a driver's knee airbag... side airbags (no seat covers here please) and curtain airbags: Airbag marking on the B-pillar: Sunroof cover is manually-operated: A view out of the sunroof. It has an anti-pinch feature: You can pop it up for ventilation by pushing the button upwards: With the sunroof open, a lot of light comes into the cabin. This is the max it opens to: Things are neat & tidy even in places where most people wont look. No loose wires or bits dangling anywhere. Notice the S201 marking on the EPS unit. The XUV300 project was codenamed S201: Foam insulation on the underside of the dashboard in the passenger footwell aids in keeping engine noise out. Wow! The cabin is very well insulated indeed: ", 15th April 2019,mahindra-xuv300,Mumbai,"17,609","76,005",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
4, Aditya , 09:49 ,Team-BHP Support,"Interior - Rear Like the front, the rear doors of the XUV300 also open and close in a triple-stage action. They swing out sufficiently wide, the roof of the car is pretty high and the floor isn't too high off the ground. This makes ingress & egress convenient for most people (including the elderly). The rear seat is placed at a comfortable height as well: Adequate space between the B-pillar and the bench makes it easier to step in & out. Door sill isn't excessively wide, which means occupants don't have to carry their feet over too much when entering or exiting the car. Unlike the front, the rear door sills do not get scuff plates: Like the front doorpads, the ones at the rear have a black & beige theme with a piano black insert. The rear speakers are similarly mounted in the upper half, while the armrest area gets a soft faux leather surface: Door pockets are just as narrow as the front ones and can hold a 1L bottle + other slim items: Unlike many of its competitors, the rear seat is wide enough to accommodate 3 average-sized adults. Larger adults are likely to find the space tight though. While the seatbase is largely flat, the seatbacks have some contours to hold you in place: Legroom is healthy and two 6-footers can sit one behind the other in reasonable comfort: Rear bench gets 3 headrests - all are on the firmer side. All 3 occupants get 3-point seatbelts as well. Center passenger sits a little higher up due to the slightly elevated seatbase; he also sits a little more in the front because of the center armrest. Yet, the width of the car makes it easier to sit three abreast: Seatbelt buckles are housed in dedicated cut-outs. Additionally, they get an elastic strap to keep them down. It's the little things, really! ISOFIX child seat anchors have been provided on both sides: A look at the maximum and minimum legroom available: With the front seat in my driving position, I have about 2.5"" of knee room to spare. With the front seat moved all the way back, I have barely an inch of knee room. The seatbacks of the front seats are hard which isn't cool at all!! In almost all cars, the seatback area is soft, thus it doesn't hurt you. What helps matters a little bit is they are scooped out where the knees are placed (but it's still not an ideal situation): The seatback doesn't recline, yet the angle is comfortable. Those who are 5'9"" & taller will find the seat to be a little on the lower side (as a result, lesser under-thigh support too). All headrests are adjustable & useful: Unlike the stupid hard seatback area, the surface at the base of the seats is soft, so it won't hurt your legs. There is enough room under the front seats to tuck your feet in: Roofliner is scooped where the rear passengers' heads would be. Headroom was adequate (not excessive) for me @ 5'10"": The center armrest is positioned at a comfortable height: It is wide & soft, and comes with two cupholders: Overall glass area is adequate, but shorter passengers will feel some restriction due to the way the window line slopes upward. Still, there is enough light coming in and the cabin doesn't feel claustrophobic at all: Window rolls all the way in: No seatback pockets. Instead, what you get are bungee straps for storage. They look cool, but are absolutely useless for storage. @ Mahindra: why fix something that isn't broken? Apart from seatback pockets, Mahindra has also missed out on providing air-con vents and a 12V charging point for rear passengers. Air vents at the back help in maintaining a more consistent temperature across the cabin. On a hot day, things do get warm at the back. The driver will have to put the front air-con on full blast: Spring-loaded grab handles. Both rear units get useful coat / bag hooks: Seatbelts can be parked in these slots (when folding the rear seat down): Whitish-grey roofliner dips down where the sunroof is located. 2nd cabin lamp is placed behind the sunroof, hence serving both seat rows: Cabin lamp has one button with two positions - ON (pressed) or door (not pressed). There is no ""OFF"" position & we agree with this (why would anyone want to disable the cabin lamp?): Short floor hump isn't much of a bother. Interestingly, the XUV300 brochure claims that the car has a flat floor (which is clearly not the case): 257-liter boot is the smallest in the segment. It can accommodate small to medium-sized bags only. This will be a deal-breaker for many owners considering the XUV300 as their sole car. The Tivoli has a larger boot, but as you know, Mahindra chopped off the rear to bring the length under 4 meters: While slots for a parcel tray have been provided, Mahindra isn't giving you one. Period. Reason? A parcel tray will make the boot look even smaller in the showroom. It's a marketing trick: Area on the tailgate - where the hook to hang the parcel tray would be - is blanked out by plastic. Gives the impression that something is missing: Boot light is located on the right: The boot floor is adjustable for 2 levels: There is a visible difference between the 2 levels of adjustment. Here is how the boot looks with the floor at the higher level... ...and at the lower level: For increasing cargo space, the rear seats can be folded down. Pull this knob up to unlock the seatback; we feel it's rather big & ugly looking: Rear seat has a split, but instead of the usual 60:40 split, it's a 40:60! Basically, the split is oriented for left-hand-drive. The seatbase is fixed and cannot be tumbled forward like in the EcoSport (click to see): Folding the seat down gives you cargo capacity of 625 liters: Move the boot floor to its upper level if you want an area that's closer to flat (but still not flat): Top tether for the child seat (there's one on each side of the rear seat): Loading lip is high. One will have to make the additional effort of lifting bags over it and placing them inside the boot: Tailgate gets full plastic cladding on the inside. No ugly bits sticking out anywhere: Remove this cap at the base of the tailgate... ...to access the tailgate emergency opener. Move this lever to the left to open the tailgate. It's the first time we're seeing this feature in this segment: Both sides of the tailgate get plastic covers, which can be pulled out... ...to access the bulbs of the part of the tail-lamps housed on the tailgate: Lift the boot floor up with this strap to gain access to the tool kit & spare wheel: Boot floor has a segmented design and has to be lifted out in a stepped manner: Tools are neatly arranged in a Styrofoam casing kept within the spare wheel: Nope, the spare isn't an alloy wheel.

6, Aditya , 09:49 ,Team-BHP Support,"Driving the 1.2L Petrol MT 1.2L, 3-cylinder petrol engine has a turbocharger; puts out 110 BHP & 200 Nm: The XUV300 petrol is powered by Mahindra’s in-house developed 1,197cc, 3-cylinder turbocharged engine mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox. This is essentially a reworked & turbocharged version of the 1.2L unit found in the KUV100. It features variable valve timing and produces a healthy 110 BHP (@ 5,000 rpm) and 200 Nm (2,000 - 3,500 rpm). While the power figure puts it behind the EcoSport’s segment-leading 121 BHP (1.5L) & 123 BHP (1.0L EcoBoost), the torque rating puts it comfortably ahead of all its direct rivals. In two words, the petrol engine is ""damn good"". With a hefty kerb weight of 1,296 kg, the XUV300 is heavier than the EcoSport by 15 kg, making it the heaviest monocoque sub-4 meter SUV in India. It has a power-to-weight ratio of 85 BHP / ton and torque-to-weight ratio of 154 Nm / ton. While the former puts the XUV300 behind the EcoSport and Nexon, the latter is comfortably higher than all its rivals. To start the engine, you need to press the clutch and then hit the engine start button. While the clutch pedal is light, we found its travel range to be on the longer side for a monocoque crossover. Despite it being a 3-cylinder, very few vibrations come into the cabin. At idling, you can barely hear the engine and there are no vibrations felt anywhere. The refinement is certainly impressive! Not many will be able to tell that it's a 3-cylinder engine, whether at idle or on the move. Throttle response is acceptable & the XUV300 moves off from a standstill in a clean manner. Despite the turbocharger, the low-end performance is good. The car can pull from even <1,000 rpm fairly easily. It managed to clear a speedbreaker in second gear without a problem. You won't need to shift down too often. It is only when a gap to the vehicle in front needs to be closed quickly that one needs to drop a gear or two. The XUV300 does not fly off the line from the word go, but the engine starts coming into its stride above ~1,700 rpm. Around town, it can cruise at 45 km/h in 3rd gear with the engine spinning at 1,700 rpm. What is not good is that the power delivery at low revvs isn't linear, but spiky. Owners will need a little time getting used to this spiky nature of the engine. The minute the needle approaches 2,000 rpm, the thing suddenly starts surging ahead. One has to go easy if there are passengers onboard. The constant surge while driving can easily get to them. In the interest of user-friendliness, Mahindra should have given it a more linear power delivery (keeping the mass market in mind). The average Joe won't be able to drive the car in a very smooth manner. Some enthusiasts though, will enjoy it. On the open road, you'll enjoy the punch of the turbocharged motor. As mentioned earlier, the engine comes into its stride after 1,700 rpm and there is a strong surge post 2,000 rpm. Want to overtake? Just drop a gear and fly past the slow moving car. The XUV300 can make fast progress on the open road if you have a heavy right foot. What is also nice is that the motor actually sounds nice when revved hard. Enthusiasts will like it. Downside? The engine revvs till ""just"" 5,900 rpm which is on the lower side for a petrol. The fuel supply cuts off abruptly at this point. This rev limit can catch you out in the middle of an overtaking maneuver! Also, beyond 5,000 rpm, it doesn’t have much performance to offer. So, while the mid-range is impressive, the top-end is poor. The overall driveability is good and you won't find the need to downshift often, but there is some lag in the higher gears. So, while getting past slow moving vehicles on undivided highways, it is better to shift down and get the engine in its power band. Long-distance cruiseability is strong. In 6th gear, the car can cruise at 100 km/h and 120 km/h at 2,100 rpm and 2,500 rpm respectively. Additionally, while cruising on the highway, the engine is silent enough. As mentioned earlier, the clutch is light, but has a long travel range. Another fly in the ointment is the gearbox. While it is light & sure-slotting, its throws are too long for a car of this class - a habit that Mahindra appears to have picked up from its bigger UVs. The shifter should have been short + slick. This long travel clutch pedal and long throw gear lever gets irritating in stop & go traffic conditions. The W8 and W8 (O) variants are equipped with an idling start/stop system, which Mahindra calls 'micro hybrid tech'. The system switches off the engine when it's idling (about 4 seconds after the clutch pedal is released) to save fuel. The motor is cranked again on pressing the clutch. However, this can be tricky in stop & go traffic. The car was caught on the wrong foot a few times & we had to restart it manually! While FE conscious users will keep the feature engaged, most people will switch it off. We found it terribly annoying. Do note that the air-conditioner's cooling is affected as the compressor switches off too. Coming to NVH levels, the XUV300 does very well at slow speeds and around town for a 3-cylinder motor. There’s almost no engine noise heard in the cabin if you're driving in a calm manner. Even while cruising on the highway, the engine is silent enough. Of course, at higher rpms, the engine gets audible. This high-rpm note is actually enjoyable and will appeal to enthusiasts. Even regular folk aren't likely to find it disturbing. Mahindra has done a fantastic job with this engine & the overall refinement is among the best we’ve experienced among 3-cylinder petrols. Wind noise is minimal at 100 kmph, while road and tyre noise are par for the course. In terms of fuel economy, the XUV300 carries an ARAI rating of 17 km/l, which is at par with the Ford EcoSport and Tata Nexon, but 0.5 km/l lower than the WR-V's (17.5 km/l). Powerful turbo-petrols in heavy bodies (e.g. EcoSport EcoBoost) don't usually deliver class-leading FE figures & we expect the same from the XUV300. GTO saw 9 - 10 km/l in the city, while I saw 11 km/l with a light foot. Bonnet is solid & heavy. Lifting it takes some effort. Hazard lights come on whenever the bonnet is opened. Both engines get a sheet of insulation under the hood: A plastic cover has been provided for the engine: Engine gets variable valve timing. Aluminium components include the crank case, bed plate and oil sump: ABS unit is shared with the Verito sedan: Honeywell turbo sits just ahead of the engine: Ample underbody protection provided: Remember the white foam insulation we saw under the dashboard? There's some provided in the wheel wells as well. All of these things do add up & the driving experience is very refined: Leather-wrapped gear knob has a glossy black top and a chrome insert around it. It's chunky and feels nice to hold. However, the gear lever's throws are too long...especially for a compact crossover. Takes away from the driving experience: Gear lever has a leather boot. Reverse is engaged by lifting up that plastic collar: Gearshift indicator has been provided. While the MID displays the current gear engaged, it momentarily flashes the gear that the car should ideally be in, with an arrow sign. Newbies will appreciate this feature: The cruise control sign appears momentarily when the feature is activated or deactivated. The green indicator (in the speedometer) stays on as long as the function is activated: ", 15th April 2019,mahindra-xuv300,Mumbai,"17,609","76,005",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
7, Aditya , 09:49 ,Team-BHP Support,"Driving the 1.5L Diesel MT 1.5L diesel is shared with the Marazzo. Developed in-house & puts out 115 BHP & 300 Nm: The XUV300 is also available with a 1.5L, 4-cylinder diesel engine that has a variable geometry turbocharger. Like the petrol, this one is mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox. It's already been seen in the Marazzo MPV. However, in the XUV300, the state of tune is different. Here, it develops 115 BHP (@ 3,750 rpm) against the 121 BHP (@ 3,500 rpm) of the Marazzo. Its 300 Nm of torque is identical to the Marazzo’s, but it is produced at 1,500 - 2,500 rpm, while in the Marazzo, it is produced at 1,750 - 2,500 rpm. The XUV300 diesel produces more power and torque than all its direct rivals. In two words, this engine is also ""damn good"". With a kerb weight of 1,360 kg, the diesel has a power-to-weight ratio of 85 BHP / ton, which is higher than its rivals. The XUV300's torque-to-weight ratio of 221 Nm / ton is considerably higher than all cars in its segment too. Like the petrol, the diesel does not have an automatic variant at the moment. Diesel rivals like the Nexon and Vitara Brezza offer AMT variants. As a late entrant in this extremely competitive segment, we feel that the XUV300 should have come out all guns blazing to make an impact. That's usually how Maruti & Hyundai do it. To start the XUV300’s diesel engine, press the clutch and hit the engine start button. The diesel fires up with very little noise, and without transmitting any noticeable vibrations to the cabin. At idle, it is impressively refined. The clutch is light to press, although it has an annoyingly long travel range - real bummer in traffic. The gear shifter is light, but again, it has long throws for a car of this class. What is good is that its gates are well-defined and smooth. The usual rubbery feel that you find in Mahindra gearboxes isn't there. Release the clutch gradually and the car moves forward without any throttle input. In fact, with mild accelerator inputs, you can move off from a standstill in 2nd gear. The car even managed to clear a speedbreaker in 2nd gear from a standstill! Throttle response is good and the power delivery is acceptable. However, there is some lag at the absolute bottom end. Let the revvs drop too low, and the engine stalls (me & GTO both stalled it). There is no anti-stall feature and the engine dies out abruptly. You cannot be careless with the accelerator & clutch modulation. Other than this, the engine's driveability is satisfactory in the city. It pulls well once the revvs cross 1,500 rpm and when the turbo spools at 2,000 rpm, you'll experience a surge of power. Once you get used to the behaviour of the engine, the XUV300 is easy to drive in the city with its light controls, a tall seating position and good visibility. The only drawbacks are the long-throw gear lever & clutch pedal. On the open road, the XUV300's performance feels strong & there is ample grunt available. Work the XUV300 hard on the expressway and you can make fast progress. The mid-range is where the XUV300 is at its best. This 1.5L feels strong in the 2,000 - 4,000 rpm range. When pushed, the engine will revv to 4,750 rpm. However, there is no point taking it beyond 4,200 rpm as power delivery tapers off. The top-end isn't strong, with the engine getting noisy above 3,500 rpm too. In terms of cruiseability, the XUV300 will do 100 km/h & 120 km/h in 6th gear at 1,900 rpm & 2,300 rpm respectively. And even in 6th gear, the motor feels tractable. If you want to overtake, say from 100 km/h on the expressway, you don't need to downshift. It can be done in 6th gear itself. Only if the revvs drop too low will a driver feel the need to downshift. The W8 and W8 (O) variants are equipped with an idling start/stop system, which switches off the engine when it's idling to save fuel. It functions just like the petrol's, so you can refer to our comments in the post above. In a nutshell, we find it annoying! Maruti has made the feature a lot more seamless in its newer cars (e.g. Ertiga) & Mahindra needs to learn from that. Further, the Marazzo got an ECO mode which we'd much prefer over this idling start/stop nonsense, if we were looking at saving fuel. Coming to NVH levels, the XUV300's cabin is nicely insulated & the car is surprisingly refined. It feels more ""Hyundai"" than ""Mahindra"". Even the insulation from exterior / traffic sounds is good. Wind & tyre noise are both well-controlled at 100 km/h. The engine feels superbly refined and under regular driving conditions, it can hardly be heard inside the cabin. The motor starts getting loud only above 3,500 rpm. There is a faint buzz on the gear lever when the car is idling, but no one will notice this (except for a BHPian). The XUV300 diesel has an ARAI-certified fuel efficiency rating of 20 km/l. This puts it behind all the sub-4 meter SUVs in the market and way off the segment-leading 25.5 km/l of the WR-V. However, we must remember that the XUV300 is a much heavier car & has more power too. Diesel engine fully fills up the engine bay: Engine has an aluminium oil sump. Good that a plastic engine cover has been provided... ...because it's an ugly sight without the cover! This is among the most cluttered engine bays we've seen: Underbody protection is satisfactory: Indicator light glows when the idling start / stop system switches the engine off: ", 15th April 2019,mahindra-xuv300,Mumbai,"17,609","76,005",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
8, Aditya , 09:49 ,Team-BHP Support,"Ride & Handling First, an important clarification. The first XUV300 test car we got was a poor handler (link). Turns out, the rear dampers / shock absorbers were defective (link). This affected most of the early XUV300s. So, if you bought one, be sure to have it checked up ASAP. Below are our observations after getting a properly functioning test car. ------------------------------------------------------ The XUV300 uses a ubiquitous MacPherson strut suspension with an anti-roll bar at the front and a twist beam at the rear. Low speed ride quality is compliant & mature. Small bumps are absorbed well, but keep in mind that Mahindra has raised this car compared to the Tivoli, so they would have to firm things up a bit. Plus, it runs on 17 wheels. There is a bit of a firm side to the ride which you will feel on bad roads & large potholes. Owners won't complain as it is overall compliant, but not plush. Equally, we might add that the suspension is more comfortable than most of its direct rivals (EcoSport, Nexon), yet not as good as the WR-V. The ride improves as the speedometer climbs. It is comfortable on the expressway. Must be noted that our test vehicle was running on 17"" wheels, while lesser variants get 16"" rims with taller rubber. The ride quality on those will be cushier. The suspension hardware functions silently too, with no unpleasant noises heard. Being a monocoque crossover, the XUV300 is car-like to drive. Owners will appreciate this in the city & on long journeys alike. Out on the highway, straight line stability is good, even well into triple digit speeds. It doesn't get bouncy over bumps or road undulations either. Grip levels are satisfactory and the car remains composed through fast corners. Some body roll is there, yet it's controlled and there are no scary surprises. That said, in the area of handling, the EcoSport remains the segment-best. The Mahindra does not have that absolute composure & poise of the Ford (I also found the EcoSport's steering to be the sharper one). As with all Mahindras, this one is rough-road friendly. You won't see yourself slowing down for rough patches, broken bits of road or dirt tracks. The XUV300 feels abuse-happy and there's a certain ruggedness evident when tackling rural roads. The grip provided by our petrol car's 215/55 MRF Wanderer tyres was decent, though not exceptional. Interestingly, our diesel test car came with Apollo Alnac G4 rubber, which was certainly grippier. The XUV300 gets an electric power steering with 3 selectable modes  Comfort, Normal & Sport. These modes can be engaged via a button on the center fascia. The vehicle remembers the mode that was chosen, even after a restart. Comfort mode - The steering is one-finger-light at parking speeds and does not require any effort to turn! In fact, it reminds me of Hyundai steerings. It is that light. This mode is excellent to use in the city where speeds are very low. Normal mode  The steering is still light, but not as much as in Comfort mode. It can still be used in the city and to some extent, on the highway as well. It's neither here nor there, frankly. Sport mode  Our mode of choice for highway runs. The steering has noticeably more heft here. On the downside, the steering needs proper calibration. We don't know why, but Mahindra never gets its steerings right. We found the steering to be too sensitive at high speed, especially in Comfort & Normal modes. Always remember to firm up the steering by putting it in Sport mode. The XUV300 has a turning radius of 5.3 meters, which is wider than the Nexon's 5.1 meters and the Vitara Brezza's 5.2 meters. Conversely, the unladen ground clearance is rated at 180 mm, which is lower than all its rivals. Still, 180 mm is enough and we didn't scrape the undercarriage anywhere. Not even on the rough patches we put the car through for photography. All variants of the XUV300 come with all-wheel disc brakes, ABS + EBD and corner braking control (top variants further get ESP, rollover mitigation & hill-hold). The stopping power is adequate even when slowing the car down from high speeds. While the brake pedal travels very little before the pads start biting, it feels spongy & mushy (again, a Mahindra trait). The brakes do feel over-servoed and you'll take a couple of km to get used to their bite. EPS gets 3 modes to choose from.

9, Aditya , 09:49 ,Team-BHP Support,"Other Points  Built at Mahindra's Nashik production facility and not the more modern Chakan factory. We're surprised!  At least 5 people who asked us about the car during our test-drive discounted the XUV300 from their shopping lists due to the lack of an automatic transmission. A missed opportunity. AMT is coming soon. Apparently, its just a temporary fix while a proper torque-converter AT is developed.  The SsangYong Tivoli was imported for research back in October 2015. First spotted testing in India in December 2015. Caught with Mahindra-spec bodywork in November 2018.  An electric version of the XUV300 is rumoured to be coming in 2020. About time Mahindra did something with EVs! It bought Reva years ago and still has nothing really to show for it. So much for a first-mover advantage.  Under panic braking conditions, the hazard lights will start flashing to warn those behind.  Mahindra knows that the boot will be a deal-breaker for many. Its showrooms actually have luggage demonstrations! Click here to view BHPian Sherlocked's post.  Available in 4 trim levels - W4, W6, W8 & W8 (Optional Pack). Even the W6 has a lot of stuff missing. The pricey W8 variants are the only ones we recommended. Mahindra should kit out the W6 properly for those on a lower budget. Middle variants are very, very important.  Doors auto-lock at 20 km/h. All doors unlock when the engine is switched off. Weirdly, all doors also unlock when any of the front doors is unlocked. As much as we're fans of auto-locking, we hate any kind of auto-unlocking. Our country is too crime-prone for that.  Service interval = 10,000 km / 1 year. Labour-free services are at 1,000 km (just a checkup I'm guessing), 10,000 km and 20,000 km. Yes, the XUV300's MID will remind you when the service is due.  Standard warranty coverage is for 2 years / unlimited km. Extended warranty available for up to 5 years / 150,000 km. Don't even think twice; considering that the car, engine & transmission are all new, just go ahead & pick up the extended warranty with your eyes shut. If still in doubt, read this 300-page thread. Not to forget, our test car itself had a defective rear suspension!  Mahindra is providing roadside assistance to all new XUV300s for a period of 2 years from the date of sale.  The SsangYong Tivoli is sold with an optional AWD.

10, Aditya , 09:49 ,Team-BHP Support,"The Smaller yet Significant Things A look at the more practical black seat upholstery of the lower variants: Apart from the Sunburst Orange colour seen on our test car, the XUV300 is available in 5 other shades. These include Red Rage, Aquamarine, Pearl White, Napoli Black and D-Sat Silver. Two of these shades are available with a white roof. Here is the Aquamarine + White combo... ...and the Red Rage + White combo. These dual-tone versions are available only in the W8 (O) trim and cost Rs. 15,000 more than the single-tone versions. This Red + White was a hit with the ladies: While our petrol test car was shod with MRF Wanderer tyres, the diesel sported Apollo Alnac 4G rubber: Partial cladding in the front wheel well... ...and full cladding in the rear: Both engine variants get their dietary preferences marked on the fuel cap. A small plastic hook is provided on the inner side of the fuel flap... ...to hold the cap while fueling: 42L fuel tank is a couple of liters smaller than all of the XUV300's direct rivals, except the Honda WR-V (40L): No LED headlamps, yet the halogen projectors do a good job of lighting up the road ahead: With the high beam engaged, the throw is just average. Could have been better: Recommended pressure of 34 PSI for the 17"" rims is on the higher side. 16"" variants have a 32 PSI rating: Rubber beading is soft, of good quality and well-fitted. Cabin insulation is very good: Driver’s footwell gets 2 hooks to hold the floor mat in place. Don't miss the contrast-white branding on these mats: Flippy key looks and feels premium. Lowest button is for ""SOS"" or locating your car in a crowded parking lot: Volume button got stuck frequently on our test car. Mahindra needs to figure how to sort these niggles out. Three problems on our test car (rear shock absorbers, air-con cooling & this button): A system check is performed every time the car is started. The speedometer and tachometer needles do a clean sweep as well: While the engine start button is backlit in white... ...the other switches are backlit in orange: USB and AUX ports are backlit in white. Storage space below them gets orange lighting: Orange ambient light strips are provided on all 4 doors (below the armrests): Front seatbelt buckles get a soft lining to prevent them from scratching / making a noise when rubbing against the center console: If any of the 3 rear passengers hasn't buckled up, the seatbelt reminder light blinks all of 33 times before going off. We like this. In the update, Mahindra should add a non-stop chime to force them to buckle up: Soft foam insulation, just behind the radiator grille.

Mahindra really impresses with the quality, build, refinement, fit and finish of the XUV300. In so many ways, it feels more like a mini-Creta than a Mahindra. And the company is smart. The Indian market has now matured to a level where customers are willing to pay a premium for top quality. That said, I wish they'd done an ""XUV500"" with the pricing, at least in the initial period. When the bigger Mahindra was launched, it led to jaws being dropped. Not the case with the XUV300. While I personally don't find it overpriced (keeping the quality & equipment levels in mind), I do know that some BHPians do. The lack of a proper mid-variant only complicates matters further. I expect Mahindra to release a W6 (O) or W7 variant. Lovely engines as well.

City driving is pretty average for engines which boast of segment best power and torque specs. The diesel, particularly, is spunky only after 2000RPM below which it is fairly average in terms of power delivery.

They're on a roll ever since the Marazzo has come in. The quality has gone up since the XUV500 days and this is a good thing. We surely didn't expect such competent products from our homegrown manufactures 10-years ago. Its indeed a proud moment for us Indians to see products which are now more-or-less ready to take on the global markets. The XUV300 is an interesting package loaded with tech. My dad, a noob when it comes to tech was actually surprised with the XUV300 when his colleague got one in the fully-loaded trim. He was impressed with the overall kit on offer. In comparision, our 2-year old Hexa felt barebones The only thing which didn't impress him are the highway manners. Otherwise, its a well-rounded package and there's hardly anything to fault with the car. Only if M&M could've given us a well-specced mid trim for the budget minded folks. The W8(0) is glaringly expensive. It has the equipment to back its price but it ain't a Hyundai when brand image is concerned. The XUV300 W8(0) costs roughly the same as the XUV500 W8 did in 2012!

The weight of prior knowledge is surely to blame; there was a time (around 2008 roughly) when Rs.10 lacs would get you a Scorpio. I know that and these facts as well - there's a 4-6% YoY price increase announced by OEMs, there have been a lot of features added to cars viz. safety, comfort etc. Inflation being what it is, prices overall have gone up. The power of compounding does astound me. And someone like Jeremy Clarkson might even condescendingly tell me that it is my problem if I won't/can't pay for this exceedingly good car. I don't know why exactly I feel this way - but I feel that Mahindra are banking entirely on the customer's willingness to pay here, as it is with iPhones. It can't be all due to inflation and high input costs in the XUV 300's case. The gap between the cost to build such products and their MRP is a huge, yawning chasm. Nothing but the customer's willingness to fill that chasm can justify such prices, or at least that's what I feel. Now, if only the early movers who buy newer cars every year (I'm looking at the kind who live in richy-rich Coimbatore) keep disposing of their cars quickly, us conservative folks can enjoy these vehicles in a pre-owned state at sane costs.

Mahindra has got it almost right except for that small boot and higher pricing. The overall whole package also seems to be more functional than funky which is a good move IMO. It will surely be a good choice for small families who want a compact SUV with some kind of exclusivity. On a side note, the scenario of XUV300 in the market can be related to the movie 300 in which a small group of men hold their ground against a huge Persian army.

One of the reasons to move out of my current car was this. Saw the photo provided in the link, the suitcases will be empty and will bend in a bit. If it is stuffed it will bulge and even lesser space will remain. Indians are not know to pack light. 2. Price, at 14-15L on road Bangalore it is good 3L more expensive than Nexon XZ+. The feature list really does not add up to 3L. Also if I am spending 15L why not spend another 1L and get the Creta SX variant.

For what it's worth, I took 2 test drives of XUV300 and rejected it for the following reasons (my frame of reference is the Ecosport S 1.0) - - The driving dynamics are way inferior than the EcoSport. The car just does not feel planted at all; body roll is significant and the ride feels very bouncy and light. - Irrespective of the steering modes, the steering is extremely light at its core. The different modes only add weight to the steering, nothing else. There is minimal feel and feedback and it does not even feel connected to the car. - The maintenance of the ivory seats is a horror story on its own.

Perhaps I went into the test drive with higher than usual expectations given the considerable power and torque figures which were published (in case of the diesel version, especially). When I did drive the diesel, I found the performance below 2000RPM to be fairly underwhelming - in other words, till 2000 RPM there was noticeable turbo lag and not much of excitement or pull on offer. Yes, once past 2000 RPM there is certainly a strong slug of torque, which is why I mentioned that highway driving with this car will be a fun experience, given the strong mid range performance. However, in a city like Bangalore (or any of the crowded metros for that matter), one will very rarely get to use mid range performance. It is mostly low end performance which is critical. To meet that spectrum of usage, the Ford's TDCI is a much more suitable powertrain where power starts coming in from around 1500 RPM. Possibly, for drivers who are able to exploit midrange performance more frequently, the XUV300 will be a good vehicle to own. The petrol XUV 300 however is much better, and should be a better city slicker. Haven't driven it much though, since I was more interested in the diesel variant.

M & M should learn how to sell a premium product. Here are my two cents: - In the era of floating ICEs, M & M design is a let down as it is difficult to look into the Map while driving, floating display gives almost heads-up kind of experience which I was not able to get in this car. Let me give you a comparison with i20, wherein this problem is not there because i20 seating is low-slung and thus the ICE display in map mode is easily visible without taking eyes off the road, which is not the case with XUV3OO because of high seating - The in-city driving around BikaJi Cama area was not up to the mark as low end torque is at par with other cars; gear shift was required from 3rd to 2nd to keep the engine at boil - The steering is quite sensitive, yet there is a complete lack of feedback. It is also dead in the straight line drive condition (few degrees on either side) On almost every other aspect, it looks and feels great.

I really loved this car, and owning a TUV300 for last 2 years I taught myself to live with M&M niggles. As I write this reply, my TUV is resting in service center due to AMT issue. Missing rear AC vent is a big bumper, I know the pain as my TUV also doesn't have rear AC vent and my wife complains everytime we go on a long ride. I have to sacrifice my side of AC vents to face back passenger. Such features rich car should have it figured out. I loved the road presence of XUV500 and its sibling continues it. I am eagerly waiting for the EV version of this to get my hands on. Hopefully M&M will listen to customer feedback and improve on this model and include things like rear AC vent, bigger gas tank, better wipers and more mordern looking center facia.

At the risk of going off topic, I would like to respond. Boot space is very important for me (and few of my close friends). The XUV300 boot space is quite similar to the space in my WagonR. In my current car, the boot is insufficient even for the luggage for a 3 day trip for two people. We have to use the rear seat or fold the seats almost every time we travel. And I hate doing that. We carry variety of luggage based on the requirements and duration of trip. Most big suitcases won't fit or will eat the whole boot space. And I have carried 2 or more of those in few trips. Sometimes for a single day trip and 4 people on board, we carry food, quite a few water bottles, a mat, etc. This is enough to eat the whole boot space and then of the seat space as well. I am against the roof loading idea as I find it inconvenient (lazy!). Also for long trips, keeping the luggage inside the car protects from the elements and risk of theft. I was shortlisting CSUVs as potential upgrade options for future and boot space is a major criteria for my next car.

Why did Mahindra have to start out with a price-conscious product design (sub 4m) and then make it feature-rich and price it out of the 4m ballpark? That's certainly part of my dislike here. Virender Sehwag was never one to play half-hearted shots in his illustrious career; if he ever played a shot, he went hell for leather and went all the way with it. Even cricketing purists had to laud his game, albeit with a grimace. What Mahindra have done with the XUV 300 is to start with a backfoot defensive stroke (by cutting it to below 4m in length) and then tried to powerfully hit a sixer with it straight down the ground. Such shots have a 50/50 chance of making it past the ropes or to the hands of a fielder at Long-on or Long-off. If they come out with a temporary (and innately cheap) AMT for the XUV 300, that'd only accentuate their primary folly even further - the cricketing equivalent of playing across the line.

Small boot. with my own personal experience I can tell that Indians are not light travelers and we have already seen in previous posts people are willing to let go of the car just for low boot space alone 2. Lack of A/C vents in the back. In these days where even smaller hatches are providing rear a/c vents, its definitely a bad miss. Indian summers can be extremely harsh. The review already talks about a mediocre a/c performance and lack of rear vents will only add to the sweat in the rear seat 3. No automatic option - Anything less than a standard torque converter AT will not work. I do not understand why M&M would want to bring in an AMT even in the short term. AMT by the very definition is cheap and I hate to see AMT going into such a highly priced car 4.

63, spittie , 14:49 ,Newbie,"Thought I'd give my first hand opinion of the XUV 300, having got it just about 3 weeks ago. I've been using an Ecosport (1.0 L ecoboost) for the past 6 years and I did a LOT of research for the perfect next car (including the new ecosport). I got the petrol XUV W8 (O). In a nutshell, this is a perfect replacement for an Ecosport or similar compact SUV. As mentioned in the review, it's loaded with features! What did it for me for the superb (and refined) engine. Even though this is a Ssanyong model, Mahindra has done a terriic job of localising and refining it. Engine has a lot of pep, very much like a naturally aspirated one. I used to reach near suicidal levels with the turbo lag of the ecoboost, especially at crucial overtaking or sudden thrust necessities. Didn't expect such a refined engine from Mahindra. They've come a long way, every since I test drove the first gen Xuv 500 and wrote off the company for not being on par with its global peers. It has achieved this milestone now! Comfort is really good, but as i'm driving the X300 more, I've realised a major lack of lower back support (i'm 5'10), which has made me get a thin 1"" cushion for this area. When pushed to the limit at high speeds, the engine emits a burning sort of smell. Will be having this checked at the service schedule (tomorrow) which I was promptly reminded of, by the MID. This seemed to be a more ""grounded"" car than ecosport, but at high speeds on curves, I found it to be much lighter. Can't go overboard, and shouldn't anyways (in most cars), unless you're in a sports car!! The size of the car is just perfect and styling is very fresh. Found too much chrome in the front and blackened out most of it as you can see in the image Accessories added were the front skid plate extender and rear parcel tray (yeah, i expected this as standard). IMO the skid extender gives a much nicer (and aggressive look) to the car. Images below is of my car after the accessories fitting (and chrome blackouts) and before. The only negative point of this car is the lack of a dead pedal. Other than this and lack of lower back support, i couldn't find any flaws. (smaller boot space, etc didn't matter that much). Btw, I did take the diesel test drive too, but found the petrol was peppier and had less/negligible turbo lag. Overall an excellent city car. Would recommend it hands down if your priorities are performance, power and features. Quote: Originally Posted by sahilkhurana Very detailed and thorough review as always.

OTOH, the Tivoli available in Australia has a 1.6L petrol engine (and a 1.6L diesel too), is 4202 mm long with 423 litres of boot space, and returns a fuel efficiency of 11.62 kmpl (8.6L/100km) for the urban cycle and 18.18 kmpl (5.5L/100km) for the extra-urban cycle (i.e. highways) for the petrol engine (combined cycle = 6.6L/100 km). Moot question is, how much cheaper is the car in India with its smaller engine and shorter chassis? The on-demand AWD version of the Tivoli has a multilink rear suspension instead of the twist beam suspension of the FWD cars. Given the shortened tail, I suspect that the multilink suspension cannot be installed, so the XUV300 will never get AWD so long as it is a sub-4m crossover/SUV-pretender.

I noticed in your review you mentioned about the blue sense app for xuv 300. I couldn't find this in the iOS AppStore. There's only one for xuv500. Or is it the same app that can be used interchangeably? Also as far as the niggles go- Ive started to get some strange sound (very light though) from the rear left side when the car goes on bumps.

80, @viral , 11:43 ,BHPian,"Drove to Mumbai and back to Pune through the expressway and completed 1k+ on odo. Here are some of my observations. 1) I am not too happy with the suspension (both front and rear). The car seems to be a bit bumpy while driving. Almost, as if the tyre pressure is not right. This is when tyres are filled with nitrogen and inflated to prescribed pressure of 34 PSI and same being confirmed on tyretronics. There were two adults in the front and two kids in the back seat without any significant luggage. The ride quality used to be much better in an S-Cross which I owned earlier. 2) The cruise control is quite effective and holds the speed fairly constant. Missed the dead footboard. The proximity of the clutch and accelerator as indicated in the mail review was a bit confusing as it is quite difficult to figure out if the foot is resting on the brake or accelerator. 3) The charging is quite effective through the charging port as well as the USB port. 4) Android Auto is not a very nice experience in terms of connectivity. It keeps disconnecting the Bluetooth for some reason which I still have to figure out. Steering controls to skip tracks does not work when playing music through Android Auto. 5) The mileage started showing 15.5 kmpl for the first time. Will know the actual figures when I get the tank filled next time. Using HSD from Shell this time. Keeping the drive light-footed is important in this car to get better FE. Also, the higher power from the engine allows me to keep RPMs between 1500 and 2k for a normal ride. To overtake while in this RPM band, makes power available instantly. 6) The front suspension makes an almost rattling noise at times when on uneven road. This could be due to low profile of 17"" wheels to some extent but was expecting a better ride quality. 7) The 6th gear is fairly powerful and did not need to downshift much even while overtaking. 8) The car can stall suddenly without notice if it falls to a lower speed in a higher gear. I am still trying to figure out how to get a hold on it either through feel or through the dashboard display. If anybody has figured it out or has suggestions, please respond. 9) Was able to do sharp turns at high speed without much body-roll and could not hear any screeching noise from the tyres either. 10) Auto-headlamps responded quite promptly when entering or exiting the tunnels. They would usually come on within 3 seconds of being in shade. Please feel free to ask question on anything that I might have missed.", 22nd April 2019,mahindra-xuv300,Pune,94,103,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

88, blueeyed , 22:37 ,BHPian,"Hi all, Did a short test-drive of xuv300 petrol variant. Being a recent EcoSport (ecoboost) owner, I wanted to know what i was missing/gaining from my vehicle when compared to Xuv300. Below are my observations. Looks: At the front, there is hardly anything that you would feel awkward of. Usage of chrome is minimum and it actually looks good up front. Side is plain and rear is where you may get the hates. From the rear it looked a bit awkward to me. Overall the design felt good. But in traffic, it would be easily mistaken for a Brezza and hence you won't be getting any special attention, rather you would just be getting lost in a sea of Brezza's. But up close, xuv looks bigger and wider. Interiors: Its inside the vehicle, where I was really surprised. It just don't feel like a Mahindra. Fit and finish levels are beyond expectations. Even the plastics feel good to touch. Build quality is nice. EcoSport has some rough edges, but xuv's interior doesn't feel so. Dashboard layout is plain and simple. Nothing there is in your face. The only sore point in an otherwise nicely laid out dashboard is the jukebox inspired centre console and the silver coloured control switches. These felt dated to me. White interior is another negative point. Now being raining in this part of Kerala, interiors, especially the white seats of the test-drive vehicle was dirty and mud stained. Hope Mahindra will offer an all black interior soon. Space: Cabin feels spacious compared to an Ecosport. Can accommodate a third person more comfortably in the rear than in anecosport. But comparatively the rear bench seemed a bit shorter and hence lacking in under thigh support. Legroom and headroom were all adequate. Drive: The engine comes to life without much drama. Vibes are negligible, another surprise from Mahindra. The engine felt refined at most times of my testdrive. When you rev up in a lower gear, it becomes audible. But at any time, there is hardly any vibes that crept into the cabin. Engine felt sprightly at most times. No lag is felt, but there is a sudden surge of power past 2000rpm. That class leading torque figure is rightly felt. Right from stand still, xuv's engine felt a bit more responsive than ecoboost. Didn't get the chance to take it to high speeds though. Clutch pedal has long play and even the gear throws are long, which will require some getting used to. Low rpms are handled well and you don't need to downshift very often. Engine is ready to pull even from 1000rpm, even though it may take its own sweet time. Power and torque are adequate if not more. But it was the handling part that made me happy for my decision. EcoSport felt a level up compared to the Xuv. Xuv felt bouncy at even small undulations. SA said it may be due to tyre pressure differences, but it was not, atleast according to the TPMS. Body roll is also comparatively higher. Rear passengers felt it more. At speeds EcoSport feels much stable. Steering also feels better on the EcoSport. Although you can choose from different steering modes on the Xuv, apart from some heaviness in the sport mode, you don't get anything else. Feel and feedback felt dull at all modes. So, for a better driving experience it is still Ecosport for me. Overall, if it isn't for the ride and handling package, Xuv appears to be a better buy.

However, before I get to my observations, the important point first. Got a RECALL (that's how they termed it) on 23rd April. The rattling noise that most fellow BHPians are talking about is from an 8"" bolt (think I got the size right) in the front suspension set up - noise that is intermittent, yet loud enough to irk (to put it mildly). Got them to tell me it was a needed replacement of the bolt - an answer from the Mahindra R&D team to the myriad complaints raised across the country. Did ask them if it was specific to the infamous K2A series (mine is) and got a resounding NO - almost like they were tired of answering questions about the K2A series. With the change done, I have zero noise generated from the set up, with a keen ear for the next 300 kms now. As for the observations and remediation sought - 1. Noise from the LHS C pillar that houses the seat belt - the black bracket that dispenses the belt from the C pillar to be specific. Figured this noise was prominent when the car wobbled from left to right over undulations. The bracket seems to have a hard finish and not a soft(ish) one. Got them to fix it by sticking a single side of a double sided tape on the back of the bracket so it isn't visible to the eye. Got this done for both, LHS and RHS. 2. Likewise, the hood stay under the bonnet needed a bit of looking into. Got them to tighten the side that helps with the ply of the stay. 3. A surprising creaking sound from the driver's seat that is heard only after about 30 minutes into the drive. Almost like some joint wasn't greased. Not sure if was from the fore and aft operation or the seat height adjustment operation. Fixed for now. 4. The rear number-plate needs some padding. 5. The IRVM is a faulty piece in mine - definitely needs replacement as it rattles over broken tarmac, something that is available in abundance over Bangalore's roads The ASS said they fixed it with some adjustment - twice over! (1st service & then the recall) Going in on Monday next, to seek some heads - really!

Net net: it will be the Ecosport for me till the Venue is evaluated by TBhp. With XUV 300 Mahindra has upped the ante and our expectations.

I think Hyundai is the one to blame here, they have no serious competition with Creta and priced it out of the park and still got away with it pretty well. Now Mahindra followed the same road, promoted a few bells and whistles like auto dual zone ac, heated mirrors etc which IMHO are not really important or worthy and portrayed the 300 as a competitive car to Creta. At least that is what they trained their sales team as I've heard this from two dealers. Looks like it's working for them so far.

151, mh09ad5578 , 23:02 ,BHPian,"Went for test drive today for the XUV 300 and man I was in for a surprise. I drive a 85 ps duster and was amazed at the ride, handing, power, space and features of this car. It feels as big as the duster from inside. The test drive car was a W8 petrol and it felt very powerful, the diesel has even more power and torque. The interior quality felt good though I would have liked the switch gear in black rather than somewhat gaudy shade of silver. Sometimes I feel Mahindra still hasn't completely matured in design and tend to overdo the stuff. Coming back to the car, the only negatives I found was the lack of rear AC vents and the price. The ride quality and suspension us top notch, I felt almost on par with the duster, even on bad roads. My budget is 12 lakhs for diesel car which gets me a SX Venue two tone with a lots of bells and whistles. In this price only the W6 XUV 300 fits in at 11.40 lakhs on road in Karnataka. This version only has a 8 inch touch screen and parking sensors nothing else. If it had similar equipment level as the Venue even excluding the sun roof I'd have brought this, but in my budget the venue makes a much better vfm proposition. The sales rep made a pitch that forget Venue the XUV 300 is better than the Creta as it has 1 airbag extra and costs a full 3 lakhs less than the Creta top end. This made me laugh, I told him if this had a boot as large as the Cretas I'd have agreed but this is a mini and it doesn't compare. W8 option diesel costs 15.30 lakhs on road in Karnataka, well I don't care about the feature set but I think this is over priced by at least 2 lakhs. But Mahindra seems to be running all the way to the bank as the SA told the waiting period was 45 days for it. Don't know if this is true though.

I'll only trust BHPian test-drive reports (for how good the AMT is) and ownership posts (for its reliability). Indeed, that is why we will wait for your opinion By the way, here's my 2-cent test-drive report, based on the few minutes I spent driving the AMT variant of the XUV300 today. The AMT is out-of-place in an otherwise luxurious car. Excellent engine, excellent ride and handling, great interiors, all features you'd ever want in a car and more, and then you have the AMT. It's like checking into the presidential suite of a luxury hotel only to find that hot water for bathing has to be brought up from downstairs in a bucket. Mahindra may claim this is the best AMT around, but it still is an AMT and it's never going to match a TC or even a CVT. Creeps well in traffic and sometimes the gear changes aren't directly perceived, but the transmission gets confused and goes through a long 2-3 seconds of hesitation when climbing on a gentle incline. Once it finds a gear, it gets going but until then your 300 Nm of torque amounts to nothing. I later test-drove the Venue Petrol 1.0 DCT to compare. the Turbo petrol and DCT combination provides a much smoother experience than the AMT with the powerful 1.5 liter turbo diesel. The OTR pricing in Hyderabad for the top end AMT is expected to be around 15.2 to 15.4 lacs.

165, pavanth , 12:06 ,BHPian,"So last month when I was looking for a sub-4m CSUV(by trading in my 8-year old Honda City), I was starting to take the TD of various options available in that segment. Along with my dad, I walked into a Rajshree Mahindra that was closest to me and to my bewilderment, half the lights were switched off. The showroomw as darker than it was supposed to be(and there wasn't a power cut- I got that clarified). We were left unattended for at least 10 minutes after which a sales executive walked to us. I told him that I'm here to take a TD of the petrol XUV300 and I also mentioned that I've taken TDs of Venue and Ecosport so that he understands that I'm a potential customer and shows more interest. Unfortunately, that didn't help. The SA told me that the petrol XUV300 has gone out for another TD and that isn't available. But I clearly saw two demo XUV300s standing outside the showroom and asked him about it. He responded by saying that both of them were diesel. So then we asked him if the diesel is available for a TD so that we can get an overall experience of the car, it's dimensions and ride quality. He refused saying that both the vehicles have been booked for a TD and will be leaving soon. At this point, his disinterest was obviously greater than my interest, so we gave him my number for a TD appointment and left the showroom. On the way out, we checked out that one of the 2 demo cars had 'PETROL' clearly written on the fuel cap. So Mahindra is not getting my money. As expected, I never received a call back from the SA. If this was the sales poeple's attitude, I can't imagine the attitude of the service advisors(which I'd have to experience very frequently, given Mahindra's reputation). I wonder if he would have shown interest if I had walked in with a cheque to pay for the car immediately. Cars can't sell by themselves, however good they are built to be.

The official review is spot on. Superb refinements, lovely engines, decent ride quality and neutral handling. The car is loaded with features except for rear ac vents. The AC unit is pretty good as I drove in Chennai heat at 36 degrees and it cooled the cabin quick after putting it in low modes with fans at full blast. Not bad as I feared. Did not see much negative feedback on ac from other owners in the owners group as well. May be they have tuned it a bit post the official review. AMT is decent but the car deserves a proper AT. The AMT does ok on inclines and is decent if you feather the throttle or if you put the foot down on the throttle for which you need good open roads. If you want to drive spiritedly on moderate traffic, there is no option but use the manual mode. If you want to have a head start at the signal, then you will be disappointed as it takes it own sweet time from 1st to 3rd post which is pretty good. Perhaps a sports mode like nexon is needed. The gear shifts are felt at the lower gears only. 1st to 2nd happens at 2500 rpms, second at 2200 rpms and subsequent shifts at 1750 rpms. The vehicle moves quickly down hill in the spiral ramp at my office and brakes needs to be applied even if I take my foot off the throttle. Shifting to 1st gear on manual mode also yielded the same result. In my swift, I used to do downhill in 1st gear with mild accelerator and without brakes. Perhaps taller first gear and heavier body could be the reason. It climbed the ramp with 5 people effortlessly. I swapped my stock tyres (MRF wanderer eco tread) to Michelin 4ST for 15k more The upgrade was very much worth it for a much superior grip, better steering feedback and nil running noice. If it had been the alnac, I would have kept the stock. The other little disappointing thing is that the ecosense is not available in the AMT version. I considered the additional 2 lakhs over Nexon XZA worth it with additional airbags, TPMS, better ride quality, auto dimming day night mirrors, dual zone climate control, ESP, hill hold, front parking sensors, a more roomier cabin, less funky rear, heated ORVMs, lesser cabin noise.

Actually the Nexon's multi drive modes are more of a mileage improving mapping rather than spirited driving aides. In the Eco & City modes, the engine's power is capped at around 70 and 90 PS. In the Sport mode, it simply maps it to the actual ""standard"" map of the engine to release its rated 110PS/260Nm output. In case of the XUV300, the engine is always ""open"" with full range available all the time. So it wouldn't make much of a difference to have a ""sport mode"" if the requirement is spirited driving. Its the AMT that is the root cause. However - get used to the manual mode & have fun! I always use manual mode in my other car & boy does that K10 revv like a rocket . Its quite addictive once you get the hang of manual mode in AMT. Pretty fun to (just that shifts are slower than DCTs. Still no rubber banding like CVTs and can be lived with.).

Perfect engine braking and sufficient speed to ensure those behind aren't caught off guard in case they aren't experienced enough (which often is the case on our roads!). Use the manual mode always on those slopes. Otherwise the AMT quickly upshifts and car suddenly picks up speed! Don't rely totally on brakes, they'll wear out prematurely. Remember to use manual mode in slopes of ghat sections also. In D mode you'll overheat brake disks and pads if the slopes are long enough. Yes what you get over the Nexon for the 2 Lakhs is worth it.

XUV 300 Hits:Premium interiors Loaded with features Refined and powerful engine Ride quality Decent handling Best of interior space Airy Cabin Nice stance Neutral looks AC has been a surprise package considering tbhp review. Despite lack of rear vents and a large cabin, the A/C has been effective in Chennai weather (38 degrees max). Haven't read much of ac issues from the owner groups in social media. Perhaps Mahindra made some updates in production cars post tbhp review Mileage for the manual version seems to be very good based on feedback from the owner groups on social media Infotainment system provides a lot of good info and is loaded with features Noise insulation is top notch and one can hardly hear the engine inside the cabin Disc brakes are very effective in spite of its over servoed nature and sponginess and All other things listed in the tbhp review. The AMT is able to handle even steep ramps well so far. However it is better to drive on the inclines in Manual mode. Misses The boot space is less but not bad as I had thought. It has been sufficient for my use so far. It is less than competition though Difficult to maintain white interiors which otherwise add the much needed ""premium"" feel and airiness to the car Official number plates rattle since they are thin and are directly mounted on the car unlike Marutis who have them mounted on black plastic holders. The quality of the plates could have been better Some Iffy Plastics: The black rubber/PVC door trims on the A pillar looks a bit cheap with the matte finish and not well finished. The glossy plastic covers of the A-Pillars and C - pillars are prone to scratches and has created enough swirl marks already. I have wrapped them with vinyl (mock carbon fiber) to prevent further swirl marks. The A pillar ones does not fit snugly. Poor stock horns from hella. Upgraded them to Bosch Symphony Low beam is pretty good and high beam not so great. The difference is only visible on dark roads Rear view is a bit poor considering the height and the narrow rear glass Absence of seat pockets on the rear of the front seat makes it inconvenient. There is no way to kill the engine with the ignition on. There is already a whistling noise from the front brakes. Saw a similar issue in the XUV500 thread AMT Related:AMT does not do justice to the engine at all. It up shifts a bit too early (i.e. the turbo lag band) and while my test drive cars were up shifting at a much later RPM (2200+). Other buyers in the owners whatsapp group state that it feels much better post the first service. Not sure if Mahindra makes any updates to the ECU as part of the first service. Up shifting in manual mode makes it much better but manual downshifts is a bit difficult since we have to ensure that our downshift does not coincide with the forced auto downshift by the AMT. My first tank to tank was 10 KMPL on bumper to bumper traffic, whilst the MID was showing 12 KMPL. This is despite the AMT up shifting early. To be fair, the average speed of the trip was 15 KMPH. Other users were citing 12 KMPL during the run in period and the mileage improving post first service Infotainment SystemThe Android auto keeps disconnecting the bluetooth many times. The auto connection on bluetooth to the phone is also not consistent especially if more than one phone are paired. The music system is average. The highs seems to be fine.

Really loved the ride and handling package considering the taller stance of the vehicle. Ride quality is better than Ecosport, Nexon and venue. Upgrade to Michelin Primacy 4 ST is really worth every penny as it takes the handling, road grip and comfort to a different level than the stock MRF Wanderer ecopias. NVH levels are very good though wind noise can be felt a bit at 100+ KMPH. Headlamps are pretty decent for driving on 4 lane roads. The best part i like about the vehicle is its engine. The roomier cabin, light interiors add to passenger comfort. However rear a/c vents would have eased the load on the front blowers and could contribute to better fuel efficiency. Hope someone at Mahindra is listening. The blue tooth disconnection with android auto did not occur on my new Nokia 8.1 but happens with Oppo Real Me and Samsung S9+. It is either due to the stock android on Nokia 8.1 or due to the fact that I did not manually pair the phone on bluetooth before connecting the android auto in the case of Nokia 8.1 unlike the other two ones.

I have recently purchased a Mahindra XUV300 w8(o) AMT - upgraded from a 6 year old Hyundai Grand i10. With the look and feel of a really large car, my family (including some extended members) has started making a bunch of plans for road trips. (Note: I am unable to explain to them, that the luggage carrying capacity of both cars is the exact same - don't ask me why - according to them the car is bigger.. so more luggage.) I was evaluating the Mahindra sourced roof carrier and was looking to seek some guidance. Below are a few points i would request some assistance or brainstorming on: 1. Carrier is attached to roof rails. My idea was roof rails in a box shaped car, increases stability during high speeds. Does having a permanent carrier attached cause an impact in high speeds or impair dynamic stability? 2. Load capacity is mapped at 50 kilos. My physics/dynamics tells me the Centre of Gravity shifts way higher making the car unstable - a lot more than Question1 for sure. Are there certain aspects i need to be careful about? 3. Can roof rails really handle a roof rack? These were debated a few days ago on a WhatsApp group, and I wanted to seek some more pointers here. Note: Been a biker almost all my life, and graduating to cars now.

Sorry for the delayed response. I had typed in a long reply from my phone and while posting it, the site timed out and my response gone. Yes, 12KMPL seems low but to be fair, the average speeds (which the infotainment systems captures for every trip) of my trips are in the low 20 KMPH with bumper to bumper traffic. AMT owners on the owners group in Whatsapp also report 12 KMPL but most of them are from Bangalore where the traffic is really bad. Manual owners report very high mileage but majority of them are from North or Tier 2 cities and seem to have much average higher speeds (Based on the photographs of the infotainment console). I have seen the mileage improve with improvement in average speeds for my vehicle. On AMT, so far haven't heard many complaints but my sample set is made of very few people only. Mahindra seems to have learnt their lessons from the TUV AMT fiasco by ensuring the up shifts happen at a slightly higher RPM (2200-2500), which also may contribute to the slightly lesser FE.

Requirements: Automatic Diesel SUV with space and the ability to carry around painting canvases and other stuff( his family has an artist). Should be comfortable and safe with enough power to be happy on his regular highway runs. Budget: 12 to 13L maximum. We shortlisted the Creta, XUV300, Nexon and Ertiga Automatic ( left field but it beats the rest for space and price, loses out on all other parameters especially safety) considered the BRV but it's too costly in Automatic variants. Anyway long story short we ended up at a Mahindra dealer staffed by 1 guy, but he knew his stuff (even was at the Auto Expo officially) and was happy to oblige us with a test drive(3 of us went). First impressions when pulling out of the dealership, the car had a hard life (16k km) but that didn't show in any area except the front bumper which was damaged on one side just the day before, which caused the parking assist system to complain about an error in the sensors. Initial response is quite good with the creep being a bit too aggressive, my cousin pulled out the same way he used to with his EcoSport and we immediately heard the chirp of wheelspin. On a slightly bouncy highway NH966A ( locals know it as Container Terminal road which has the most atrocious expansion joints) the ride was quite planted and we saw speeds approaching 100km/h effortlessly. The initial acceleration from signals pushed us back in our seats and we didn't feel much lag either. Manual mode makes it a lot more fun to drive and the noise from outside except the tyre roar is quite well controlled, even the engine is a distant hum. The ride is quite good considering the 215/55 R17 tyres and braking inspired a lot of confidence. Side Note: The SA knew pretty much everything about the car in and out and showed us all the features and was quick to mention the 5 star safety rating as the first point of introduction. He even admitted that there was an initial batch of vehicles with suspension issues which were resolved as well as agreeing that Boot space was at a relative premium. He also plainly said that they are trying to reduce as much paperwork as possible and keep all communication via email or WhatsApp and provided us with price lists and such like digitally. He was open and informed us that there my be a delay till April to get BS6 variants and wasn't sure of the price hike yet. We were looking at the W6 variant since that fit the budget at 11.4 Lakhs on the road for BS4. He said that they had run out of stocks for all except a couple of W8(O) AMT in Red and Aquamarine.

Shortlisting: With Scross 1.6 completing 5 years, I was not comfortable keeping it post warranty period. Test drove only Xuv300 and Brezza and liked both, However space at the back and want for a diesel powertrain turned in favour of Xuv. Next was variant selection. I didnt want to spend too much on a new car, so it was a tossup between W6 and W4. W6 didnt feel a VFM variant (with 1L diff) and I thought of adding all the features aftermarket/ at dealer. Dealership experience: was below average, right from the sales enquiry, test drive, accessories fitment, delivery they messed up on almost all the things. With lot of negotiations they matched outside insurance price and I got handling charges waived off as well. With 25K exchange bonus I got it on road at 9.97L. For Scross 1.6, 5 yrs old, 48K run and second owner, I got 5.25L. Modification done: All Mahindra original accessories Alloy Wheel - 40000 (post 5% cashback offer) Roof Rail -3990 Spoiler - 3520 (unpainted) Central Locking - 3130 LED reflector light -1195 (awaited) Front Fog Lamp - 3800 apart from that I paid 6800 ( fitting and spoiler painting) charge.

There were few niggles (listed below) in the vehicle which Mahindra resolved as part of service actions. The dealers had a very cold feet about the recalls and service actions which needed constant follow-ups and frequent email's to Mahindra. Suspension Knuckle - There was excessive waving effect in the rear during medium speed cornering's. Also the vehicle felt instable while tackling the speed breaker humps. This was notified to Mahindra via email. We were asked to send the vehicle and the same was replaced at the dealer. AC Water Leak to Co-Driver Footwell - After every trip, there would be water accumulated up in the co-driver footwell area. On taking to the dealer, this was rectified. RHS Headlamp Glass - The right hand side headlamp glass became cloudy within a short span of time. When enquired, got to know this was also a common issue faced by many owners. The same was replaced when contacted Mahindra. During the dealer visit, I asked them to check if there are any more items to be replaced as part of service action. Hence they changed - Acoustic Plug, HFM Sensor, some kind of a ventilation pump for the headlamp. Glovebox Glove box used to fall off frequently due to faulty clips. This was also replaced. Android Auto Android Auto disconnects frequently. No fix has been provided so far. Software has been updated few times.

Looks super cool with the mods. Currently, my odo reads 770km. Completed a day-trip to Nashik on 2nd January. This was my first highway drive with Phoenix. The experience was super awesome and she is a real pleasure to drive. The diesel mill is as good as they come, and though I have not yet explored the punchy mid range yet (keeping the revs under control during run-in), it has enough grunt post 1200-1300 RPM. Got to test the cruise control feature for the first time and it is quite a help while cruising. Likes:The punchy engine. The overall NVH levels. Ride quality is great. Handles well. The steering weighs up nicely at high speeds in Normal mode. Sports mode adds additional weight. Body roll is obviously present, but acceptable. The width of the vehicle and the lower GC provides additional stability. Extremely comfortable on long routes. Park regeneration mode for DPF (not tested though). Dislikes: Removal of ESP from W8. Mahindra - what were you thinking? As many have mentioned, Android Auto keeps on disconnecting all of a sudden. Have changed cables but the issue persists. AC console display. Fuel Efficiency: T2T gave me 15.7 kmpl but unfortunately, I forgot to compare it with MID reading for equivalent mileage. This is a mix of highway as well as city driving (in Mumbai traffic) and I am quite satisfied. On expressway, the MID has shown up to 22 kmpl with a light foot. A 30 km drive in Mumbai traffic which took 1.5 hours returned 15.5 as per MID while on a worse day, the same distance took 2.5 hours and the MID showed 12.1. Boot Space: Yes, the elephant in the room! Surely, no where near the competition. But then, it is adequate for me. For a family of 2, it can easily carry luggage for a trip of 10-15 days. The 60:40 split is helpful and there won't be an issue even if there are 4 people on the move. The only instance when this will create an issue is when there are 5 people and equivalent luggage for a long trip (7 or more days). Personally, I see this happening once in a blue moon. Niggles: I asked my dealership to fit the W8(O) seat covers and the same had plastic covering (as shown in the pictures). Once I removed the same, a squeaking noise appeared (only when the vehicle is on the move). It comes from the right hand rear side near the seat belt housing. I tried to troubleshoot with a lot of use cases and found that the noise disappears when the rear seat is folded. I believe the sound is either coming from the seat belt mechanism or the clip where the rear seat is attached once it is upright. In either case, it is annoying and will try to have the SA address this during the first free service at 1000 km (which will be completed during my planned Lonavala trip this weekend). My only worry is the capability of the SA to diagnose the cause and rectify it. Did anyone else face this?

325, Aditya_Dhull , 21:43 ,Newbie,"Hi Guys, Im Aditya from Mumbai. Ive been following this thread for some time now. All of you guys discussing the car in such detail has been really helpful for me in making a decision about booking the XUV300 Diesel AMT W8(O). We are a family of tall, big people with two dogs and old parents. My wife and I are looking for an automatic car (because of the insane Mumbai traffic), that could also be easily driven on some off-beat routes (we love to take the more scenic routes wherever we drive) and a good highway cruiser (we also always prefer to drive rather than fly to our destinations). The XUV300 AMT Diesel seems to suit all these needs well. No other car in this category ticked all these boxes for us. Other than WRV no other car in this segment felt so spacious and comfortable inside. But WRV didnt have the automatic. I loved how planted it felt during the test drive. It feels solid. It feels like you are driving in a luxury car (until you lay your eyes on the dashboard, it looks horrendous). Now we are totally sold on this car. But just before booking it, I wanted to share a few things that are worrying me. I say worry because its turning out to be an expensive car to buy. And I dont want to regret missing any obvious problems with this car. Could I request some of the long-term owners of the XUV300 Diesel AMT to please share some negatives about the car that should be considered before booking it? For example: - The car did not feel as comfortable to drive in bumper to bumper traffic. The breaks were too sensitive for such heavy traffic. This combined with the slow 1st gear response made the ride feel jerky. Is this something that has been troubling the long term owners a lot while driving in the city? Should this be a deal breaker since my wife will drive it a lot in the city traffic? - I noticed that some interior parts like the glove box, buttons, rear seat armrest etc. had either come loose or had worn out in the test drive cars. Mahindra has a reputation of starting to sound like tractors after a few years. These noisy and cheap nuts & bolts & clips & buttons, are these a regular nuisance to any of you guys? - Is the maintenance of this car too expensive compared to a petrol automatic? Are there any other hidden maintenance rituals like the AdBlue additive? Is there something a novice like me should know about this BS6 Diesel AMT? Or hidden troubles or maintenance costs of the AMT itself? - How does the diesel AMT drive on the winding Ghat section roads? Does the AMT inspire confidence on Highways and Ghats? Is overtaking trucks a pain? - My wife has never driven a car before. She has a licence but no practice since she got the DL years ago. Do you guys think the AMT Diesel will be easy or difficult for her to drive? Especially in the city? Are there any other negatives about this car that I should keep in mind before booking the car? Again, thanks a lot for sharing on Team BHP. It not only helps me in deciding the car I want to buy, but in the process also educated me about various aspects of cars and driving them.

That is the way it is supposed to behave in slopes to hold the car on a safe descent, else the brakes will overheat. Remarks from the Autocar test drive for reference. The AMT variant comes with hill-hold assist feature which prevents the car from rolling back when you are on a slope. Another good feature of the AMT is that while going downhill, the unit doesnt upshift to a higher gear immediately when the speed increases. It will hold on to a lower gear to give you more control while coming down a hill.

Another good feature of the AMT is that while going downhill, the unit doesnt upshift to a higher gear immediately when the speed increases. It will hold on to a lower gear to give you more control while coming down a hill.

332, Goandiaries , 14:34 ,BHPian,"Hello BHPians, Might be posting my first issue here.. My diesel W8O MT is about 40 days old and the first 1000 km was driven within the state of Goa. I had a 3700 km planned covering 4 states, and I wanted to complete the 1000 km inspection service before this planned trip. I started my drive - exit Goa, hit some good plain roads in Karnataka (the Pune Bangalore highway) and I noticed this weird sound whenever the turbo kicked in right after 1500 rpm. The best explanation of this sound that I could possibly come up with is like this - a muffled 'chu chu chu' (like a broken whistle instead of the continuous whistle that I used to hear in other diesel cars that that I have driven). And when it happens, I feel like there is a momentary loss of power before it gives the full power surge. Once noticed in the beginning of this trip, I couldn't ignore this possibly odd sound throughout the trip! Please note that this sound is not so obvious if the AC blower is running at high speed and the audio system is loud. I normally kept the AC blower at 2 and audio at 2/3 bars, during which I could clearly hear this weird turbo kick-in sound. I am not really sure about how the turbo sounds in this vehicle is as there is not a single Diesel vehicle for test drive in Goa. I thought of testing in some other state, but I couldn't do it due to time constraints. Are there any diesel MT owners or some turbo experts here that could shed some light on whether this is how it is supposed to be?

Possibilities: 1. There is a distinct rumble @ 1500 rpm when the engine is still warming up; Check if the sound persists even after 15-20 minutes of driving 2. New XUVs have reported issues of gear oil leak that starts off as a rumble around 1500 rpm in the third gear 3. Some XUVs have a dashboard noise like chu chu chu that is more prominent on long drives, try to isolate this 4. The rubber boot near seatbelt pre-tensioners tend to dry up and create a chu chu sound. Try lubricating the rubber boot from outside and see if this resolves the issue These are the most common possibilities that I could think of based on your description. It would be great if you could elaborate more on the driving conditions, driving time, specific conditions when the problem is prominent.

I This diesel engine is right at the top of the segment in terms of refinement and NVH. I am yet to drive another diesel that is as refined as this one. However, one piece of advice for those looking at the MT: The 1st gear is too long and the 2nd gear too short. You will shift from 1st to 2nd around 18-20 kph and 2nd to 3rd around 25-30 kph. This requires you to shift down to 1st gear everytime even in mild traffic and when taking small speed bumps. Most folks won't notice this in a test drive but it becomes quite a cumbersome experience over long city drives.

I TD'd both the manual and AMT Petrol versions, over the same route that had a good mix of highway and bad roads. And this vehicle has stayed at #2 on my list since then (losing out to the Magnite on VFM) - but by far #1 of all the vehicles I've TD'd in the last 3 months. Suspension is beautiful, and you don't feel the 3-cyl setup at all. The noise insulation is pretty good and I definitely felt that I was inside an SUV whether I was in the front row or the back row. So my recommendation is, don't dismiss the Petrol variants - definitely worth a try. If I were in the market for an MT, my search would have stopped right there - the transmission was smooth and short, the response quick and prompt! But the AMT felt wheezy. I am not sure if the missing electronics on-board had anything to do with it - this vehicle came without the infotainment system.

Well, that's where the market is moving, isn't it? 3 cylinders with turbos are the norm of today. You atleast get a 1.2L motor from this and the Nexon, while competition are into 1L pots.

So a pretty middle age vehicle, which had seen a couple of years worth of test drive abuse. My impressions: 1. The refinement levels are SO GOOD! After shifting away from idle, the engine just goes so calm! No vibrations, no noise. I had set my expectations at the Nexon diesel levels, which I had recently driven for quite a bit. But boy oh boy does this trounce the Nexon in NVH and refinement. Impressed. 2. There is a slight turbo lag till approx 1400-1500RPM, but after that boy does thing just catapult you.. Nay... Trebuchet you into tomorrow! That 300Nm kicks hard and keeps on giving. It is amazing to drive. The rolling acceleration is just a whole other level. I didn't even notice when I shot from 30-90 after taking a turn. The service rep had to warn me not to hit 100 as the monitoring box logged that. 3. The ride is supreme. Those 17"" shoes give it so much confidence, be it turning, or taking curves on the highway, or going over uneven road surfaces. 4. The brakes on the test vehicle were a bit softer than I had expected from quad discs, but maybe that was down to the state of the brakes and tyres. All in all, super impressed.

Why is the sales executive pressing so hard, is it possible that the vehicle has some problem and he wants to sell it as soon as possible? 2. Is it alright to pay the ex-showroom price, but wait for PDI to pay the rest of the charges like RTO charges, insurance, etc 3. I spoke to the showroom about replacing the factory speakers, and they agreed but told me they would send the technician to my home, and did not want to do it at the showroom or the service center?

369, Aditya_Dhull , 21:36 ,Newbie,"Hey guys, Hope everyones safe from COVID. Weve been trying to be safe and patiently waiting for the car. We had booked it in February and the estimated delivery date of the XUV300 Diesel AMT White colour is still around mid-May (3-months waiting period). It gives me some time to read a bit about the car before starting to drive it. Ive been reading a downloaded owners manual to familiarise myself with the workings of the car. Meanwhile I have a few concerns I wanted to get some guidance from you guys about: - The headlights in this car seem to be weak. I noticed it during one of the test drives as well as on multiple threads and blogs and comments online. Is there any solution to this? I dont mind spending money on better new lamps but will that screw-up the wiring and hence the warranty of the electrical parts in any way? - The stock Speakers in this car are really bad, even in the top spec W8 (Optional) model that weve booked. It was very disappointing to be honest. Its quite an expensive car at the end of the day. They could have put decent speakers in it, if not the very fancy ones. I definitely want to upgrade the speakers. Have any of you upgraded your XUV300s speakers yet? Any suggestions? Mahindra seems to be offering some Sony speakers on their official accessories website. But I was wondering if there is any Bose speaker option for this car? Also, the same question as with the headlights- will the after market speakers mess with the wiring and hence the warranty on the electrical parts of the car? Is it safe to install noise dampers in the door? Do dampers affect the functioning of the air bags or any other feature? Just to clarify, I am not into blasting loud music and have a party in the car. I just like good quality refined sound when on a long road trip. Its one of the best things about driving. It almost feels like a den. - The Horn of the car sounds like its from an old Santro. Any suggestions? Should i upgrade to something smoother like the VWs horns or should I just shut up and live with the stock horn because of the wiring-work, warranty etc. - The ACs on two different test drive cars were not cooling very well. I took turns sitting in the front seats as well as the back. I did an afternoon test drive and one in the night. The cars always felt a bit hot inside. Im hoping it was because of badly maintained test drive cars and not a long-term problem with all the XUV300 ACs. Itll be a bummer if thats the case because everything else about this car is so good.

Headlight bulbs are externally connected to the electrical system and are designed to be swappable. As long as you use a new bulb of the same power ratings, NO. You will not void your warranty. Just make sure to stick to the stock power rating on both bulbs. 2. Speakers are also swappable. As long as you don't add like a dedicated amplifier+subwoofer system, just swapping out the speakers should not affect warranty. 3. Horns also thankfully are swappable.

Again no issues in honouring warranty claims. I've heard great reviews of JL Audio's C1 components as well, though, never tried them. I'm quite happy with Infinity.

373, Chitta Pradhan , 14:24 ,BHPian,"Hi All. I have heard that Mahindra has corrected the petrol XUV 300 pricing. I was today checking on road price in Carwale site in my city ( Bhubaneswar) and I found a huge price difference in diesel & petrol, which was not so earlier. For example- W8 diesel- On road- 13.03 lacs W8 petrol- On road- 11.23 lacs Difference- 1.80 lacs Will you guys still recommend a diesel? The ARAI certified FE are also pretty close 17 vs 20 kmpl, unlike other petrol/diesel models where FE gap can be 5/6 kmpl. I had test drove a diesel sometime back and that time got impressed with the car coming from my present Verna 1.6 CRDI. The NVH was impressive & 300 nm of torque was addictive. Only thing I missed is the dead pedal which I am so used to now. That time, I did not take TD of petrol as the price difference was small ( around 60 k or so). But now I think I should try a petrol too. Those who have experienced both, please draw a comparison and your opinion please- 1. If budget is not a constraint, which one will you choose? 2. NVH of both. 3. Actual FE of both. 4. Which one would be more niggle free? 5. Do you miss the dead pedal? 6. After Verna, is XUV 300 advisable? I am ok with small boot. I am considering this as almost a Creta with 2600 mm of wheel base.

Cheers I believe you should TD the petrol and that would help you decide. I can talk from diesel perspective while for petrol, I have driven it once. As you compared W8 of both, it isn't an apple to apple comparison. I believe the W8 diesel now comes with a sunroof while the W8 petrol doesn't. Please compare prices of W8 (O) for a fair comparison. Having said that, both engines are class leading in terms of torque and enough horses to make the car a punchy one to drive. I would suggest you check your monthly usage and go for the diesel if it makes economic sense. However, the diesel is just amazing especially in terms of NVH and gives the feel of a gasoline motor. That combined with that 300 NM is a mouth watering prospect. As stated above, diesel NVH is just amazing. I think the petrol has quite good NVH too. For diesel, sedate highway drives will give 22-23 kpl. Drive it at 100-120 and it returns 18-20 based on how heavy you are on the pedals. City drive with a mix of open roads and heavy traffic returns 16-17. Traffic at its worst (office hours Mumbai B2B traffic) will give 12-13. You can deduct around 3 kmpl from these figures to get petrol FE. However, do remember that turbo petrols are prone to give poor FE if driven too hard. In terms of engines, the petrol is relatively new to the Mahindra stable who have always been known for their diesel mills. However, I haven't heard of any big problems with the petrol motor serving in the XUV. Mahindra is now investing in making good petrol engines and their recent mStallion lineup is excellent too. So, you can expect the 1.2 to be niggle free. Personally no. I have never owned a car with a dead pedal and I am used to it. Others who are used to a dead pedal may miss it. Why not if your budget is in this range? It is a superb car, quite fun to drive, amazing set of engines, excellent ride and the 5* GNCAP rating. The Hyundai 1.6 is a benchmark when it comes to diesel engines in this segment and the 1.5D comes the closest in terms of drivability as well as figures on paper.

375, Dramadude , 19:15 ,Newbie,"XUV 3OO 2021 Feb model buying experience My friend bought a XUV 3OO W8 Opt after extensive research (and by extensive I mean extensive). He is a driving enthusiast who previously drove a 2010 Honda City and plans to tour on not so good roads in the near future.The main selling points as per him were the impressive safety features of this vehicle. He was particularly most impressed by the 3 point seat belt on the middle rear seat, which he appreciated on the test drive vehicle. He found to his utter dismay that the 3 point seat belt had been changed to a 2 point seat belt in the car delivered to him. Moreover, there was no tiretronics on the infotainment system. He took it to the dealer thinking they had installed a lower variant infotainment system. The dealer claimed that a software update was required and it was working thereafter. Though he was somewhat mollified by the dealer's prompt action, he was still left scratching his head at the pointless, thoughtless and dangerous action by Mahindra of removing the 3 point seat belt. For a manufacturer whose touted selling point is safety, and who is source of great pride due to their Indian origin, this is a disastrous and cheap cost cutting measure. This especially since the latest version of his previous car, the new Honda City, now sports 3 point seat belts in the middle rear seat. Not to mention the upcoming Taigun.

The after sales service has been simply outstanding. This was a pleasant surprise to me as most of the reviews on the forum state it as a hit or a miss. 2. Average fuel economy in city and highway. My city usage has been very low (less than 20%). The overall mileage has been around 17 for me. City would be 13 to 14 while the highway mileage has always been 18 to 20 kmpl 3. Availability and cost of spares Did not need any yet but looks like the overall packages offered are pretty reasonably priced. My first service would cost me 3.2K which is very reasonable 4. Seating comfort, both front and rear (extremely important) This is where the XUV scores pretty well. With wider seats you definitely have great comfort. It easily seats 3 adults in the rear, I have driven with 5 adults and 2 kids on board from Vijayawada to Hyd and no one complained about not being comfortable. One observation from the W8 seating is the driver seat makes a little karr karr noise while I try to adjust myself at traffic signals 5. How well is the car ageing? Any rattles or failures? I think this car will age really well. Mine is the dual tone red & white and it gets a few stares whenever I take it out for a spin. Only one rattle experienced so far, the IRVM was making a very small noise when driven on multiple speed breakers (small ones at toll gates). I took it to the service station and the issue was fixed. They patiently heard me out, ensured they got the issue right and diagnosed it perfectly. No niggles or any rattles apart from that 6. Any issues with the turbocharged petrol engine? None so far, it pulls like a train. I am light footed and it's definitely a peppy engine. I'm currently considering a petrol W6 variant for myself. I'm 5'11 and my family members are in 5""3 or 5""4 range. The boot space does bother me but I am willing to make the compromise since you cant get everything at a budget of 10 lakhs on road. I've considered Nexon and Altroz before putting XUV300 on the priority list. Any useful insights on the vehicle would be appreciated. I plan to keep the vehicle for the next 7-8 years minimum so need one that ages gracefully. My annual run is anywhere between 9-12k so not considering diesel. I did not take the boot space as a compromise at all. It is actually ample for a family of 4. But with standards set at 350 to 400 liters, we feel it's small. I stuffed 4 big bags and one small trolley suitcase and still had a clear view of the rear. My plan is to keep it for 10 years too. I test drove both Altroz and the Nexon. While the Altroz was too low on power, I did not like the interiors of the Nexon that much. Also, the power of the XUV is addictive, so other cars feel a let down. With safety of paramount importance, I chose the XUV trim model with 7 airbags. Must say, there is simply no regret, it ticked all the boxes I had as requirements. Also, I think with so many segment first features, the pricing is not really inflated. Go for it.", 6th April 2021,mahindra-xuv300,Hyderbad,985,"3,460","Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

390, Duckdoc , 21:01 ,BHPian,"I was wondering what car to buy, having had a Honda City for close to 11 years old and having to give it away to my daughter. My colleague suggested the XUV 300 because of its impressive safety and knowing how much value I place on that. I bought a 300 W8 opt Diesel MT. I was fortunate that the rest of the family also prefer the MT. I was concerned about what my family would think about the looks. Once I told them, it looks like our dog, a boxer, with a flat front and a chopped off tail, they absolutely were sold. I have driven 3000 kms in the first month over roads which I would have struggled on with a City. I really love its ruggedness and the powerful and fantastic engine, and not scraping any speed brakers till now. There is an exhilarating surge of power at 80 km/ hr in 5th gear, at 100 km/ hr in 6th and a milder one even at 120 km/ hr. Besides, my son who is 6'2"" was able to sit behind me comfortably though I am a six footer. I found the much maligned music system better than I expected, while not fantastic, at least for the '70s and '80s rock I mostly listen to after turning down the bass a bit and playing around with the equalizer. I was also happy with a mileage of 15.9 km/ l on bad roads with innumerable speed brakers, barricades and animals crossing at regular intervals. There were a few things which I had to get used to. Firstly, the seating position was an issue. I have to drive with the seat raised to get as much under thigh support as possible, while my wife has to drive with the seat lowered to reach the pedals, which seems counter intuitive. Then there was this blind spot of the A pillar and ORVM, and need a bit of awareness to see and avoid the 2 wheelers cutting in from the side roads on the right, without concern for life or limb. The boot space was adequate for my needs. I do miss the driving around curves with gay abandon which was a pleasure on the low slung City though, and the driving comfort. Another issue to get used to is the brake which is soft to begin with and then with a sudden bite which can be unnerving in city traffic. For someone used to controlling the speed using gears with a light touch of the brakes, here, I had to come down a bit more on the brakes. I found there was no light for the boot, apparently for the new XUVs, which was a minor issue, though it seemed pretty cheap. As someone who always made sure everyone buckled up even in the rear seats and in a profession dealing with accidents, I was excited that there was going to be 3 point seat belts for the middle rear seat. I did know by casual reading that this was not there. However, I assumed that this would not happen in the top variant. I was bitterly disappointed, especially as Indians, there was a certain amount of pride in an Indian car manufacturer having made the safest car in India and South Africa. This was especially galling since the TD vehicle had one. The above is a reason why everyone looks with awe at manufacturers like Volvo, in contrast, who made it available to everyone a long while back without charging for a patent, as the article below shows: https://www.forbes.com/sites/douglas...the-world/amp/ I guess altruism and good business ethics continues to be elusive for the Indian car manufacturer where form seems more important than substance. It gets one's goat to see someone obsessed with the media profile and gifting Thars to those who don't need such largesse, with the cost cutting being borne by the unsuspecting customer. In a civilized world, there would be a recall and fitted with the correct seat belt, especially as it was there earlier.

Ref: https://www.caranddriver.com/feature...tire-hysteria/ So I did observe it a bit more closely, and now am certain that the readings it was displaying at that point was a ""stuck"" past reading probably from my previous drive. The next day I had to drive around for about ~20 minutes, and the readings changed to more sensible values. Meaning the reading refresh/update cycle either depends on the vehicle moving, or the engine staying on for a certain amount of time for sure. Later I also topped off the air pressure in all 4, so now I am quite certain that the spurious readings are in fact just older readings that the system hasn't bothered to refresh yet.

How many here rejected XUV300 just for low boot space??? Well, a lot is said about the boot space of this car, and rightly so. It is the minimum of this segment and some hatchbacks give more. However, we should not go only by the number (257L). Let's consider the segment average as 350L (Ecosport and Nexon give this, Sonet is more while some are lesser too). This means that XUV is 93L lesser than what competition provides. That translates to one trolley extra which it would not be able to carry (the large one I believe is 77L, the medium is 67L and the cabin one is 55L). Not even any combination of the above 3 types of trolleys, can fit in the competition. Not that big, eh? What also affects the carrying capacity is how the space is implemented. For example, I believe the Polo has 280L boot space. That is because it is a bit deeper than XUV boot. But what XUV provides is a bigger opening (because of its width and height). The below picture shows how I could stuff in 7-8 bags ( 2 big, rest are smaller) in the boot, along with a vacuum cleaner. That too, without removing the parcel tray. Remove it and it can accommodate more. What's better, is that the car provides 60:40 split. So, if one not carrying 5, they can always get access to huge space by trying out these combinations. The car's width ensures that passengers at the back are comfortable, even with seats folded. Please note that I am not defending the small boot of the XUV. Of course it is a compromise, which the owners knew even before buying, and made an informed decision considering that the space would be sufficient for their requirement. What I am saying is that, the space is not hugely less than competition (maybe because competition does not provide anything extravagant). Yes, it will fit a bag lesser, but in return, it will give a comfortable seating to 3 at the back, which very few in the competition can do.", 5th July 2021,mahindra-xuv300,Thane/Kolkata,184,491,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

The Sonet, Venue and Nexon we tried all had issues accommodating two 6 feeters one behind the other which is usually the case at our home. I could care less about the boot as we are light travellers and we were upgrading from small hatchbacks anyway. Update : The mileage never seems to go above 13 kmpl in city traffic.

473, ashishk29 , 09:15 ,BHPian,"Did my first express-way run since I got the car, and some thoughts/observations, and interesting incidents follow: 1. The car is A BEAST on the expressway. That 300Nm torque translates to overtake pretty much everything without breaking a sweat. 2. Cruise control is a God-sent. It is so relaxing to just lock CC at 90kmph and relax while the car does ALL the work. Plus the immense torque means it has absolutely no trouble keeping the speed flat. I was amazed by how effortlessly the thing was overtaking other cars despite being in CC. 3. The handling is superb. I am so amazed that this tall C-SUV has less body roll than my previous low-slung Jap Jazz. At one point on those big C shaped bends on the E way I even overtook a Honda city whilst I was on the outer lane! Plus the humongous tyres keep it really stuck to the road. 4. For someone having features like auto-headlamps, auto-wipers, they are so handy. I was feeling fairly redundant at one point since the car was basically maintaining speed, operating headlights and wipers all by itself 5. Rear foglamps is a delightful addition. While returning, extremely heavy rains+evening time meant very poor visibility. Having those rear foglamps on does the job perfectly. 6. Speaking of heavy rains: I BADLY wished I still got the heated ORVMs which M&M decided to axe from the later variants for whatever stroke (of genius?) they had. Is it possible to get those retro-fitted? Are they available as spare parts with M&M? 7. The turbo lag does feel a bit annoying when stuck on traffic+inclines. On flat roads it's not that much of an issue. 8. The headlight throw is poorer than I had expected. Especially the high beam. It falls short, and isn't bright enough. Might consider bulb upgrades in the near future. Now on towards the funny/irritating incident: I left from my destination point, to return home. Literally just 5 minutes into the drive and I get a ""Low tyre pressure"" warning for the front left. I panicked. Checked the details in the TPMS menu, and it was literally just 1psi lower than the front right. And it was 29psi, which I admit is low, but not low enough to warrant a TPMS warning. So I headed on and went to the nearest tyre-vaala and got him to top up. I left from there, and just checked the TPMS menu for fun, and saw that they GENIUS of a tyre-vaala that he was, had inflated all 4 tyres to about 40psi. Not where I was expecting someone to give 110% to their job. So then headed on to the nearest large fuel station, got a nominal fuel top up, and got the tyre vaala their to re-adjust. Thankfully they had one of those digital machines. So he hooks up the machine to each tyre, and one thing I noticed right away was that the readout on the TPMS screen was VERY accurate, and matched the reading on the machine exactly. So the machine obviously saw that the tyres were inflated way past the set pressure, and started deflating the. And the TPMS again throws a warning saying ""Tyre pressure leakage"". Very good feature, I admit. But given my experience from the past half hour I couldn't help but laugh at what all the TPMS went through. The pressure leakage warning lingered for about 30sec-1 minute even after the re-adjustment was done. And this happened for all 4 tyres one by one.

Personally, not a big fan of AMTs. But then, I would recommend that you stay away from DCTs because of their reliability issues in the long term. The questionable safety of Hyundai-Kia is also something to be careful about. Both Nexon and XUV are solid cars. Between the two, Nexon will be a bit more practical because of the larger boot. However, XUV will be much more fun as the engine has a superior response than that of the Nexon.

This nice directions board that shows up on the screen at every major junction is amazing! Very nicely thought out and implemented. The way this very visually shows that I need to go up the flyover, kudos. There's also a very nice little icon it uses to show which exit I need to take at a round-about.

And this is especially worse for the W8 (o), since the W8 would get 16"" 205/65 ones, which arguably are better suited for the ""SUV"" moniker.

My tyres are way too new else I would definitely have switched them out for something thicker. I drove my Jazz around for almost 50,000km on stock tyres, without a single puncture. On the very same highways. I feel that in the case of the XUV, we have a couple of mitigating factors apart from the tyre profile: 1. The suspension is quite stiff. 2.

Absolutely unavoidable. I've already done about 200km on the spare when the incident had occured. Now the question is: Do I go through with the 250km run on the spare itself? Is it fine to use the spare for that long? The alternative being, getting the tyre installed at the MRF dealership with an ordinary valve and do the trip on it. Then once the TPMS sensor arrives, go to the service center, and get it installed. Only downside to this approach is putting the wheel through 2 dismount-mount cycles, since I will have to do it originally to install the new tyre, then remove it to install the TPMS sensor, and then fit it again.

The shift in the handling experience, and the fear of not having a spare tyre on a ~250km journey was unsettling for me. 1. The busted tyre: That is quite a gash.

I got lucky that the replacement tyre is the exact same manufacturing batch as the original one. 1121. 11th week of 2021. So roughly mid March of this year. Not bad. 3. Just some observation while the car was up on the hydraulic lift: That is some decent chunk of under-engine protection! Glad to have it. Also, important note: The tyre guy told me to maintain 36psi in these tyres. This was at an authorised MRF dealer. So I'm taking their word for it. I was originally puzzled when I saw that the Mahindra recommended pressures were 34-32. The 32 was bothering me, since it was the same as the front pressure on my Jazz. Which weighed about 400kg less. And the tyres were a meager 175 profile R15's. So I anyway had been maintaining 34 all around. But what they told me makes sense. A tyre this big, running a load that heavy, should be running about 36psi. So I am going to maintain that here on. The TPMS sensor is yet to arrive. The SVC guy said it'd be 4-5 days.

513, ashishk29 , 07:25 ,BHPian,"Update on the headlight upgrade: So after some thinking and budgeting around, I settled on a hybrid combo.

Now the usual issue with LED is that the light is not omnidirectional like a halogen, but what I noticed was that the High beam has this kind of shroud inside, which has a plastic strip holding it in place. Which aligns with where the middle piece on the LED bulb would be. So it's light that I would've lost with a halogen as well, and thus wouldn't affect beam pattern by much. Photos: 1. The new LED compared to the stock bulb. I checked and verified the mount-to-light-source distance is the same on both. 2. LED installed in the high beam. This is the shroud I was talking about. And the strip holding it is clearly visible. 3. Low beam. This was my exact idea. I want it to be bright, but not daylight bright, since these lights will be ON while driving around city at night, and I do NOT want to be a menace to other road-users. What is more important is that the beam has a gradient on the right edge, so it won't glare onto the other lane. Noticed this when I was driving parallel to a divider wall. 4. High beam. The high beam is now pretty strong. It's bright white, and falls at a great level. To the point that I have become very conscious about using it. Thanks to the brightness, and the height of the car, it lights up the entire cabin of most hatchbacks in front Which is exactly what I didn't want. But they light up the road very well.

You don't need to change to the 16"". Just maintain 36psi instead of the ""recommended"" 34/32.

526, Aditya_Dhull , 23:00 ,Newbie,"Hi guys, We got our XUV300 Diesel AMT W8 (O) delivered on 8th August, five months after the booking date. In this period between the booking and the delivery Mahindra increased the price of the car by Rs. 75,000/- Had no option but to pay this extra money. It feels really good and plush. The ride is very comfortable. Im not really enjoying the AMT in certain situations. For example, small gaps in traffic always feel like a missed opportunity because it either is too slow or too torquey. But overall its very convenient in traffic and on highways too. Its peaceful to not worry about gear changes and easily sip on your coffee while driving and taking calls on the hands free. Love the apple car play experience. Wish there was a more comfortable cubby space to hold the phone while driving. The headlights are really poor. Ive been following some recommendations by you guys on this thread and will definitely need to upgrade the lights. Especially for the terrible and sometimes dangerous Maharashtra roads. If anyone knows a good Auto Accessories Shop in Mumbai, kindly recommend. I was wondering if I can upgrade the rear view camera too, its very poor quality at night. Its sad that Mahindra removed small yet important features like the boot lamp and the heated ORVMs. Especially after the increase in price. The ORVMs get foggy way too quickly and the water droplets make them almost unusable while driving in the rain. Now, I need an advice from you guys here. The next day after the delivery I noticed that all the 4 disc breaks were rusted. I googled about it a little and spoke to the dealership too. Both threw up the same answers, that its common for the disc breaks in new cars to be rusty since they are parked in the open compounds of the factory, especially if we buy the cars around the monsoons. Apparently after driving in dry conditions after a while the rust (which they say is only surface level) gets scraped off after a few hundred kilometres.

I have recently upgraded the bulbs on my W8(o). Osram nightbreaker laser for the low beam, TVS LED for the high beam. As for the reverse camera, you can't upgrade the camera alone. You will likely need to also add some kind of connector thingy to the cables coming from the new camera, and remove specific cables from the older connector. Could get messy. The camera is ok in daylight, but can be quite grainy at night. I've just gotten used to it at this point.

Our monsoons are heavy enough that mirrors on most cars become useless quite immediately. On my previous vehicle I had gotten small flaps that went above the mirror to block some water. Currently I am trying out an anti-rain coating that I bought from Mr. DIY store, but yet to test it. Quote: Originally Posted by Aditya_Dhull Now, I need an advice from you guys here.

Rust on discs is normal. Especially in this current humid monsoon weather, leaving the car parked for even 2 days will attract a mild layer of rust. I faced this recently, and talked to a friend of mine who happens to be a service technician. He said these discs are usually just iron, and it is bound to attract rust. Sad part is that their function is such that we can't even coat them in anything to avoid the rust. However the rust isn't a source of problem as such, since the very first brake operation will skim that surface right off the disc. You might feel a slight crunch when moving your parked car after a couple of days. This is due to spot rust formation on the rear discs, which will stay engaged due to the parking brake. On a separate note, need some inputs from other owners here: When the car has the engine running, how do I only shut off the engine and go to ACC mode? If I hit the keyless start/stop button while the engine is running, it goes straight to OFF mode even if I have depressed the clutch.

528, SansGT , 19:21 ,BHPian,"Completed a really long trip with my Phoenix. Kharagpur to Mumbai (almost 2200 km) over the course of 3 days. Here is my experience: Route Taken: The shortest route is via Raipur-Nagpur (1850 km). However, I was not very sure about the road conditions. Hence we decided to take a slightly longer route via Bhubaneswar-Visakhapatnam-Vijaywada-Hyderabad-Pune-Mumbai. An additional 300 kms but undoubtedly much better road conditions, especially post monsoon. Stopovers: Day 1 at Vizag and day 2 at Hyderabad. Road conditions: Kharagpur-Balasore stretch is quite good, though it is only 4 lanes. Then comes the worst part of the trip (Balasore-Cuttack) which is under construction and the road is very bad. The stretch from Cuttack to Brahmapur is good enough (though not the best). But once you cross Brahmapur and enter Andhra Pradesh, there is no looking back. The roads are just amazing - wide, almost zero potholes and such joy to drive on. Other than small stretches in between, the roads till Mumbai are super awesome. Performance of the car: Oh boy! How it impressed me. It performed flawlessly for the entire stretch of 2200 kms, always ready to do anything it is asked for. The roads allowed the car to be constantly driven in triple digit speeds, and at stretches, speeds far north , and it did these speeds without a flinch. The stability was amazing and the car never felt nervous. The steering modes are super helpful and the sports mode added confidence at these high speeds. I got to test the braking too. Got into a situation while entering Mumbai where an Alto in front did a sudden braking. I had to go all in (had speeds around 50-60 km/hour) and the car stopped without a fuss. The ABS worked perfectly, and fortunately for me, no one hit us from behind. We were 3 of us and had to carry a lot of luggage. So we made use of the 60:40 split to make the car a 3 seater and generate maximum space possible. Once the seat was down, the boot space was impressive. Besides all the bags and other things, we had an ergonomic chair and we could fit the same in easily. The wide opening of the boot helped, and this is something a sedan with 450L boot wouldn't have accommodated. The width of the car ensured that the single seat at the back, helped us sit without a fuss. The only negative I felt was the absence of the rear AC vents. This was the first time I sat at the back of my car for some time and I missed the AC vents at the back. Not that the AC is not effective, but it needs to be played with to make the cooling at the back pronounced. Just switching on the AC at 22-24 degrees would be super comfortable at the front, but it isn't effective enough at the back. We found the hack though - switching on the AC at it's lowest setting and then gradually increasing the temperature to optimum levels, cools the back effectively. However, the front passengers may feel the chill during the process. As for fuel efficiency, I got 15.6 kmpl for the entire trip. I never expected any better, given that the car was never driven to extract economy, saw continuous high speeds, and experienced B2B traffic for long durations in Vizag, Vijaywada, Pune and Mumbai. I followed ashishk29's advice and maintained 36 psi. Overall, it was such an amazing experience, and I look forward for similar ones very soon. Here are some snaps from the trip.

Mahindra have really gone above and beyond to reduce the cabin noise. Case in point, I recently noticed that there was white foam padding on the inside of the wheel well, i.e. inside the engine bay. 2. The A/C is definitely powerful enough. There might be some delta compared to the Nexon, but I believe that's because Nexon has a slightly smaller cabin. But overall, the A/C does a fine job.

I suspect one reason for my experience might have to do with the tyre pressures. Ever since I lost a tyre to a pothole, and the MRF mechanic recommended I run 36psi, I have been diligently doing so.

Your problem is not with wipers but with contamination on the windscreen from car wax / grease / traffic film. Typically this happens when: 1. your car wash guy uses the same cloth to wipe a waxed car or greasy areas and then uses it on your windscreen 2. Deposits from traffic film (diesel exhausts and road tar) build up on your windscreen 3. Contamination in your washer fluid tank Using newspaper is a cheap way to get rid of majority of the traffic film but the best way that I know is to use a dedicated glass cleaner.

The Clear Glass Spray is manually sprayed on to the windshield and wiped off with a clean microfiber cloth. You can follow this up with another wipe to remove those smudges and streaks with an absolutely clean microfiber / waffle-weave towel. Wipe the windshield from outside the vehicle in vertical motion and from the inside with horizontal hand movement; that way you will be able to tell by looking at the smudge patterns (vertical or horizontal) if they are on the outside or inside respectively.

As various videos I saw said that led in reflectors should be avoided as it might cause on coming traffic issues. Great question. First off, the projectors are designed for halogen beam spread pattern. LEDs do not have the same 360 degree beam formation, and hence you might have wrong throw, causing it to spill over into the oncoming traffic. Projectors are far more reliant on a 360 degree spread compared to the regular reflector, since the regular reflector is not a perfect sphere. Also remember, your low beams will be operational full time whenever there's low light. By comparison, the high beams are to be used only as a pass light, or on unlit highways. Where, some obvious aberrations in the spread patterns will not convert into a total nuisance. I wouldn't say that my above logic is 100% scientific or fool-proof, but going by the following 2 facts: a. LED in low beam will definitely cause some pattern malformation, and low beams will be operational full time. b. Beam malformations in high beam are a bit more acceptable than on the low beam, since we would ideally be running the high beam sparingly. I was more comfortable with having the halogen in the projector, since it has the perfect cut off shape designed, which I wanted to preserve as is. Having an LED there wouldn't guarantee the shape would be retained, and that was a deal-breaker for me since the low beam would be operational full time within city limits. Also I never put on the high beams in the city limits (Not exaggerating. I never do). I only ever use them as a pass light, where I shine it for hardly a second. For a second long flash, the aberrations in beam patterns are far less likely to have any substantial negative impact. Now based on my current experience, I did not find any weird hot and cold spots in the LED reflector spread pattern. So I must have been lucky there.

553, Aditya_Dhull , 19:40 ,Newbie,"Hi Ashishk29, Thanks for your replies and your guidance. I took your recommendation and upgraded the headlights. I got OSRAM ones. And wow! The difference is like day and night. I got LED Fog lamps and Osram HIDs for the Low Beam. I ran out of money so will fix the High Beam bulbs next month. The high beam lights actually are not as bad as the low beam ones. I also changed the main windscreen wipers while i was at the store. Again, what a massive difference from the stock wipers. These clean much better and leave fewer marks or streaks. Anant Podar is right about the grease and contamination part. New wipers + Washer fluid will help. Also, sometimes small leaves and tiny flower petals get stuck in the wiper blades and cause marks on the screen too. The car cleaner sometimes misses this and I've made it a habit to clean it myself once before sitting in the car even morning. Overall, I'm really enjoying driving this car. It feels planted at high speeds and the AMT is such a huge comfort in the Mumbai traffic. I tried to keep the tyre pressure to 35 or 36 PSI too after reading your post, but that totally changed the feel and comfort of the car. So now i'm back to 34 PSI and prefer the ride quality at this tyre pressure. I'm leaving for Jaipur this Friday with my wife and our dog to meet our parents. We're doing Mumbai>Udaipur>Jaipur and back in a span of 2 weeks. While in Jaipur we plan to drive to Ranthambore with my parents. It'll be a long road trip and hopefully a safe and enjoyable one.

554, Duckdoc , 09:29 ,BHPian,"First 10000 kms initial ownership review of a 2021 XUV 300 W8Opt MT Diesel After having owned a Honda City for 11 years(https://www.team-bhp.com/news/3rd-ge...ars-13-lakh-km) I was looking for a fun to drive car from around Nov 2020. Having been biased toward sedans, I have always been fascinated by only one set of cars and that is the Skoda stable, from the Rapid to the Octavia. I've admired the build quality and more importantly, the absolutely fantastic high speed handling which I've seen on the highway. Moreover, on a visit to the Czech Republic 10 years back, in conversations with the locals one could sense the immense pride they had in Skoda. On telling them that it is owned by Volkswagen, the retort was that the Germans were just helping in marketing, quite understandable given the history with their powerful neighbour. The pride in their country and the workmanship from the Java days had a positive energy to it and having been a fan of their countryman, the late Vaclav Havel and the composer Antonin Dvorak being a family favourite, I had a soft corner for anything from this lesser known country. However, each time my head turned toward Skoda, it was firmly pointed away by my colleague and fellow bhpian, because of the infamous service record of the local dealership. I am a bit of a dreamer but my colleague is a no nonsense, feet firmly planted on the ground sort of guy and immensely well informed that finally his words that I would be donating a significant part of my salary to the local Skoda dealership finally got through even to me. Brief thoughts of the 5th gen City were there but didn't like the idea of a longer overhang in front. This is when he suggested the XUV 300 with its impressive safety features especially all seats getting the 3 point seat belt. I personally like a car for the engine, acceleration and ride quality, hate bling and not too bothered about gizmos so I started taking a closer look at this. I was also not too bothered about the boot space as the kids had grown up and in the process of leading their own individual lives. I read almost everything about it, especially the reviews from South Africa and was getting more and more interested. I did 4 test drives. This being the first time I drove a diesel car, I drove it it like my City, with 1 gear lower than ideal for acceleration and the SA said she had never heard the engine sound like this. I was very impressed with the NVH, the acceleration and the quick time to get into triple figures. I was in favour of a petrol engine but the dealership mechanic who has been with cars for 35 years advised me to go for the diesel version for Mahindra and so I plunged into 3 unknowns for me, diesel, CSUV and Mahindra. I actually told him that I would be buying a Mahindra only because he's the head mechanic. This is the stage when I finally told my wife about the XUV 300 and she asked me, 'What about the Thar?' I then realised the hard to explain, almost hypnotic, mesmerising effect the Thar has on people including me and more pleasantly surprising, my wife. I told her that it is the most impractical car ever made and someday when it's 5 door with a bigger boot we can entertain thoughts of buying. Well, the thing which helped decision making away from the Thar was the waiting period. Now the next thing was the colour about which I was not too bothered, but the rest of the family wanted Napoli Black. So I finally booked a XUV 300 MT W8 Opt because of the 7 airbags, in the first week of Feb 2021. I finally managed to convince the family about the difficulty with this colour with all the dust around and the final decision was a Dual Tone Aqualmarine for which I wrote an email the following week to Mahindra. I knew that in all likelihood this would be my last MT, but the AT I would own has to be DCT or TC with paddleshift so I was comfortable with this choice. I got the VIN number and knew that it was manufactured in Feb 2021, and the car was delivered to the local stockyard 3 weeks later. However, there was a delay of a week for the HU to arrive. The mechanic told me that he would do the PDI and it is one of the greatest things of being in a small tier 2 city that one can trust people like him. It cost 14.80 lakh OTR, I didn't want any chrome added and just skid pads for the back and sides. The dealership did an underbody coating and 3 M sun film for the glass as a good will gesture and I was grateful. So, finally after RTO registration and underbody coating the car arrived home at 8.30 pm on 12th March. I insisted on not having the ribbons and cheap chocolate, but the delivery guys arrived at home with a ribbon on the bonnet apologetically saying it was toward a photograph for their bosses, and I insisted on removing the ribbon immediately, thereafter. The next 5 minutes was spent ripping the plastic over the seats before the shocked delivery guys and I told them I hate sitting on slippery plastic and like to be comfortable when sitting. Having already planned a 50 km trip that night to visit our relatives, we set out. My right hand kept hitting the annoying voice assist on the steering wheel and from that day I have been able to stay clear of this. The next month being state elections, it was stopped multiple times. I had stuck printouts of the RC PDF from Digilocker on the front and back and there were no issues. The RC as a card and HSRP arrived a month later. The first 1000 km servicing was done 3 weeks after buying. I did follow the running in instructions but not to the letter as I was enamoured by the turbo. First impressions: One look and it doesn't look or feel like a Mahindra and you know that they've definitely upped their game. The light colour of the interior and upholstery gives a pleasing appearance. Surprisingly, it is easy to clean, at least so far. The doors close with a solid 'thud' and there is a feeling of solidity about the build. Things which I had to get used to: It took 5 minutes to get used to the long gear shift and clutch travel. The gear shifts slot in well, though occasionally there is an issue shifting from 5th to 4th. I had to raise the seat to get the maximum underthigh support which was kind of counterintuitive as I am tall. As it is slightly wider than what I was used to, took a few days to have the confidence to squeeze through tight spaces. Having used engine braking extensively in my previous sedan, here on down shiftng there is not much reduction in speed but requires much lighter use of the brakes than otherwise. There is a blind spot because of the ORVM and A pillar which one needs to be aware of. There is a sudden sharp bite to the brake and one has to be careful in city traffic. It becomes better after a few kms of driving each time. After a week or so, got into the habit of upshifting gears just before the turbo kicks in for a smoother, nicer drive. I did stall a few times at low revs in low gear and one has to downshift to avoid this happening. The Start/ Stop function has to be disabled each time and now it is routine to do that on starting the vehicle. Having said that, everytime I had forgotten to disable and the engine switched off at traffic lights, it always started without any hesitation on pressing the clutch. There is a single chime at 80 kmph and is continuous at and over 120kmph. While some may find it annoying, I didn't mind it so much as with the NVH and acceleration being great, it remains a useful reminder before getting into dangerous speeds. The ORVMs close only one way and I'm still wary of it getting swiped by bikers. Ride and handling: Whether in the city or highway, it is comfortable and car like to drive. I use the 'Normal' steering mode in the city and the and the more weighted 'Sport' on the highway, though there is a lack of feedback to the steering. While it is assured at curves and there is no body roll, on the highway at speeds one has to slow down a bit on curves, as you can feel a bit of uneasiness. Straight stretches at speed is handled well and it just eats up bad stretches. Things I wished I had known before buying: The car comes with 215/55/r 17 tyres, and the spare is 205/60/r16, not a big deal as most cars now are like this, but this change could have been communicated. The heated ORVM feature had been removed. The rear middle seat belt had been changed to a lap belt Absence of a boot lamp. When the dealership doesn't tell you about deleted features and the company silently cuts features, initially you keep searching for more unpleasant surprises. The story of the seat belt: One of the main reasons for buying the vehicle was the 3 point seat belt for all seats and its absence for the rear middle seat was an unpleasant shock and remained a grouse for a few months. While I could live with the other cost cutting measures, this was something I found hard to stomach. At this time there was this sensational post (https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/road-...-seatbelt.html (XUV300: I converted the lap-belt to a *safer* 3-point seatbelt!)) and got this done as well. I remain truly grateful to @Goandiaries for this. Thereafter, I truly started enjoying this vehicle. Comfort: For someone with a dodgy back, I find the driving position great and relaxing. This is one vehicle where 3 average sized guys can sit comfortably at the back. On top of it, my son all of 185 cm can sit comfortably behind me. Besides, with the suspension and longer wheelbase they don't feel thrown around even on bad roads. Other points: The headlights I felt were just about adequate and I had no problems recently driving back from Chennai late at night in pouring rain with foglights on, when a lot of cars had actually stopped. The defogger also worked well. I really appreciate the autodimming IRVM and the auto wipers in front as well as the rear wiper. Having a TPMS for the first time, it has become a sort of obsession. I try to keep the cold tyre pressure just above 34 psi and on highways and bad roads at 36. I've gone over numerous potholes and unmarked speed breakers without problems. I was never a fan of the sunroof and thought of it only as a marketing gimmick. However, a few months after buying this, I slid the inner lid exposing the glass on top in pouring rain and the cabin just lit up and it was a sight to behold. Now, it is not uncommon to do this at night on the highway. The AC was better than expected and though there are no rear vents, there has been no complaint on this count from the rear even in summer. The music system could have better but can live with it. Once in a while, the Android Auto gets disconnected, unfortunately usually when navigation is required. The FE was around 14.5 kmpl in the city and 17.5 on the highway. My daily drive for work and back is about 14 kms and manage to drive in 6th gear at least for a few hundred metres and haven't had the DPF clogged warning so far. The rear parking camera is alright in daylight but at night is dim and grainy. Memorable trips: Being cooped up for a year and with the looming second wave and lockdown, decided to get out for some fresh air, more to remain sane than anything else. Beaches So, the day after the state elections on April 6, set out for a beach tour in the heat of summer like 'mad dogs and Englishmen'. There were 4 members in the family and decided to visit the beaches south of Pondy for a week. The first stop was the historic ancient port town of Pompuhar, a place I've passed by but never got to visit till now. The ancient port city destroyed by a tsunami in the 4th century AD is the setting of 2 Tamil epics Silapathikaram and Manimegalai. The priceless ancient artifacts from about 2200 years back housed in the dilapidated, run down museum, speaks volumes of our apathy and lack of interest in our history. The next place, a few kms away was the old Danish settlement Tharangambadi, later ceded to the British. The old governor's residence adjacent to the sea and now a hotel is a place we've stayed multiple times. Tharangambadi means, 'place of the singing waves' is a place I like precisely because there is not much else in this one horse town, where even the single ATM may not function. Sitting on the verandah with a book and the sound of the waves in the background is my way of destressing. I have to mention, a few years back while staying there, my wife and I were the only inhabitants and at night with a powercut and no lights, the sound of the howling wind, lashing rain and plaster falling from the high roof could have put a ghost tour of an English castle to shame. The next stop were the beaches of Rameswaram, and it was surprising that one could find a sheltered bay without waves with only our family on the beach and swim peacefully hundreds of metres into the sea. Tiruchendur was next. I had heard number of stories over decades, of the filth on the beach adjoining the famous Murugan temple and was pleasantly surprised that it was clean and well kept. Manapad is less well known and the leeward side of the triangular rock face jutting into the sea was beautiful and dotted with shoals and dunes. I then had to make quick time to see the sunset at Sunset Point in Kanyakumari but to the disappointment of the hundreds who had gathered, the sun decided to hide behind clouds at dusk that day. After staying the night with relatives at Palayamkottai there was a short trip to Port Trust beach at Thoothukudi, again a sheltered bay but a bit crowded with fisherman and their boats. After a trip back to Tirunelveli, it was back home on the delightful highway. Tirunelveli to Madurai is one of the best stretches in Tamil Nadu where cruise control could be employed, though I've never used this feature so far. Kallanai: I've made 3 trips to Trichy but on one in late July decided to visit the historic Kallanai after seeing the rare sight of the Cauvery in full flow. Having been there more than 20 years back I was taken aback at the crowd visiting, though the upkeep was much better than what I could remember. Built by the legendary Chola king Karikalan, it is the oldest water regulatory structure in India and the 4th oldest in the world. However, driving the XUV there on the dam was a feat by itself with mm separating vehicles from the opposite side with ORVM closed. 3 point seat belt for the middle passenger, much to my relief Priceless treasures at Poompuhar The dilapidated museum Bungalow on the beach, Tharangambadi View from the verandah of the sea at night 8 centuries old temple with Chinese architecture to attract their mariners apparently Flamingoes in the far distance, Dhanushkodi Deserted beach at Rameswaram Pamban bridge Tiruchendur beach with the famous Murugan temple in the background Manapad Kallanai Thus, exactly 6 months after buying this car it went for the 10000 km sevicing and is back So, for someone who half expected the glove box or something similar to fall off, it just didn't happen. There were no clutch plate or suspension issues and no rattles at all and all sensors work well. So, this decision to go into 3 unknowns, diesel, Mahindra and CSUV seems to have been worthwhile, at least, so far. With the XUV 300, Mahindra seems to have got the basics right with the engine, comfort, build quality, ride and handling. It also seems to have sorted out reliability issues and inspire confidence, being niggle free.", 14th September 2021,mahindra-xuv300,Tamil,108,659,Electric Motor/Battery,Very Positive

I've also realised that in a bid to increase this support, tall people tend to spread their thighs while sitting and there is ample width to do this. I have never been driven around, so can't answer the next question. However, I have had feedback from two passengers, one who was 185 cm and the other 176 cms in the rear on long distances who said they were comfortable. As to the mechanic, he meant to allay my fears of the diesel engine in that Mahindra has been associated with this fuel type for a long time, rather than any issue with the petrol engine. As you can see from multiple posts on this thread, many are extremely happy with the petrol version. So, I feel it's a personal choice and with factors like FE, fuel prices, and usage, this choice has worked out well for me. My biggest surprise which I didn't expect was the refinement and the NVH.

564, Akilan1597 , 07:47 ,Newbie,The xuv300 is my first car and I must say it's beginer friendly. I've never felt so confident behind the wheel. One star feature of this car that is not mentioned here is the cruise control. The fuel efficiency improves a great deal with it. Also you could control the speed from your right thumb giving your legs some rest. Mine is a Jan 2021 make and I do have a boot lamp. So that is confusing.

It's great to hear that the service station people even agreed to do it. When I enquired for the first time back in January regarding this, the accessories manager (I understood later he's not the one for this job!) in the showroom told me that I have to change the entire seat assembly . Later, after getting acquainted with the service manager of the showroom, he helped me acquire a couple of parts, which helped me finish the DIY job. While procuring parts, he told me that the service station will not help me doing the job due to already heavy work load they are facing and they have no training / authorization to do such a job!

568, Rollingwheels26 , 11:33 ,BHPian,"So i booked my XUV300 W8(O) about 7 days back. It was all done over the phone and whatsapp so yesterday me and the missus decided to go to the showroom to meet the accessories person (have ordered quite a bit of those !) and to meet the sales team in person. The showroom is MM Motors , Iyyapanthangal , Chennai. Showroom is brand new and HUGE. Sales team is prompt, professional , quick to respong and eager. 9/10 would reccomend. 1 mark deducted because of the lack of discounts given considering the showroom is new and the incident detailed below When we were there,two XUV 300s were on display side by side - a W8(O) Red and W8 Aquamarine. Now considering we were torn between these two colours before we settled on Aquamarine, the presence of these two colours side by side reignited the debate in our heads. Sensing our confusion the sales person said that while our waiting period would be the usual 12-14 weeks for Aquamarine, if we wanted Red we could have the display car. I checked the odo it read 80 km. VIN said it was June manufactured. Now while I was mulling over whether to take a red car the sales person said two interesting bits- 1) Mahindra might soon be removing front parking sensors from even the top end W8(o) 2) This particular car had heated ORVMs ! Now this I found strange since the car had a 2 point seatbelt at rear and its a known fact that the heated ORVMs were removed alongside the 3 point seatbelt. I pointed this out but he kept insisting it was there. Now what I am curious about is- is it true that Mahindar might be removing the front parking sensors from upcoming manufactured W8(O)s or was the sales person just making it up to push an immediate sale ?

Moreover, on a visit to the Czech Republic 10 years back, in conversations with the locals one could sense the immense pride they had in Skoda. On telling them that it is owned by Volkswagen, the retort was that the Germans were just helping in marketing, quite understandable given the history with their powerful neighbour.

It's good that at least the auto retains all the bells and whistles. However sad that the manual is getting an inferior treatment.

I am 100% sure that this could be the issue which I had reported way back in Feb/March in this thread Quoting below: Quote: Originally Posted by Goandiaries Hello BHPians, Might be posting my first issue here.. My diesel W8O MT is about 40 days old and the first 1000 km was driven within the state of Goa. I had a 3700 km planned covering 4 states, and I wanted to complete the 1000 km inspection service before this planned trip. I started my drive - exit Goa, hit some good plain roads in Karnataka (the Pune Bangalore highway) and I noticed this weird sound whenever the turbo kicked in right after 1500 rpm. The best explanation of this sound that I could possibly come up with is like this - a muffled 'chu chu chu' (like a broken whistle instead of the continuous whistle that I used to hear in other diesel cars that that I have driven). And when it happens, I feel like there is a momentary loss of power before it gives the full power surge. Once noticed in the beginning of this trip, I couldn't ignore this possibly odd sound throughout the trip! Please note that this sound is not so obvious if the AC blower is running at high speed and the audio system is loud. I normally kept the AC blower at 2 and audio at 2/3 bars, during which I could clearly hear this weird turbo kick-in sound. I am not really sure about how the turbo sounds in this vehicle is as there is not a single Diesel vehicle for test drive in Goa. I thought of testing in some other state, but I couldn't do it due to time constraints. Are there any diesel MT owners or some turbo experts here that could shed some light on whether this is how it is supposed to be? Thanks! Quote: Originally Posted by Goandiaries Unfortunately I couldn't capture that sound using my phone video - it is not loud enough to get recorded. I thought I'll fix a GoPro inside the engine bay, but didn't find time to do that experiment. Meanwhile I had to visit the dealership for some other purpose and while I was there, I explained the mechanics regarding the turbo sound, and initially they were unable to 'hear' it. And once they heard it, they acknowledged and they told me that they will have to open a jobcard and I leave the vehicle with them so that they will do a diagnosis with M&M. I was not sure about leaving the car since I am doing another trip this extended weekend. I also noticed black deposit on top of the catalytic converter / DPF, which is located right below the turbo unit. Attaching a couple of images for clarity. The black deposit is NOT oil leaking from the turbo oil inlet - it feels powdery to touch - like soot. A zoomed out photo for more clarity of where this area in the engine bay is! I'm not sure how many BS6 diesel owners are there in the forum but whoever reads this may check it out in your engine bay and post an update if possible. Thanks!

This issue is not always reproducible and very random.

They just kept the vehicle for a day and said the problem is not reproducible. I did not expect such a disgusting response from a manufacturer that claims to now make safe vehicles. So much for 5-star safety when the seatbelt mechanism itself is faulty. I have asked the service guys to give me in writing that the seatbelt assembly is fine. Now I will have to go through the hassle of pointing my dashcam inwards towards the driver and get a video recording of the seatbelt un-buckling itself when driving. Replacing the seatbelt assembly is not costly but I plan to do it at some other service dealer once I get the evidence video about it unbuckling randomly.

Within 3 hours I've been informed that the seat-belt assembly has been replaced and my vehicle will be ready shortly. I don't understand why they couldn't do it in the first place. I understand this is a random issue and not every time the seatbelt is going to come out by itself or when tugged. But, its not like someone would just want to replace a seatbelt for the heck of it. My service advisor had personally seen me tug out the seatbelt with my hand. But the mechanic staff was insistent on reproducing the issue themselves it seems when it is so random. On the Bluesense Plus app, I could see my car start and stop notifications for around 40 minutes in the morning which means that is the amount of time they spent diagnosing the issue, at best. Its just that my first experience of an issue (its not even a niggle, this is something that can decide whether the driver lives or not) has not been so good with Mahindra.

590, Turbo_Lawyer , 14:50 ,Newbie,"As a newbie here, I wanted my first post here to be about a travelogue in my XUV 300 W8(O). But fate had other plans and the first post about my car is about a pretty serious issue. I had purchased the car in May 2019 and as it's my only car, it's been used in the city as well as for frequent highway trips. On an average, I shuttle up and down to Coorg from Bangalore around twice a month. Absolutely loved the torque rush and the almost car-like driving dynamics. A niggle-free, freshly baked Mahindra car with absolutely no issues for 2 years? I knew this was too good to be true. And I was right. Cut to the last week of August 2021 and during one of my usual drives to Coorg, I suddenly could not shift the gear from 2nd to 3rd. I passed it off thinking I had not pressed the clutch at the right time while shifting gears and this might have caused the resistance. But no, a few kilometers later, the same issue popped up. This time the issue was slotting it from 4th to 5th gear. I had carefully pressed the clutch and shifted the gear at the same time, so I realized that was not the issue. The whole journey was a great struggle in engaging the gear as I have never faced such resistance doing the same ever. Returned back to Bangalore the next day and immediately drove the car to the Anant Car Service Center on Bannerghatta Road. The Service Advisor and the technician went on a drive and upon inspection, it was concluded that there was an issue with the gearbox and that they would have to check the same in detail. Mind you, this was on the 1st of September, 2021. A couple of days later, the Service Advisor informed me that the whole gearbox needed to be replaced and there seemed to be a defect with the gear teeth. Now to be honest, I am not very technically oriented with the inner parts and workings of a gearbox. I was quite flabbergasted as the car had only run 24k kms at the time of the incident. The only relief was that the car was still under warranty. The Service Advisor told me it would take around 10 days for the issue to be fixed as the parts would have to come from the Chakan Plant. Since it was a manufacturing default, I requested the Service Advisor to provide a Loaner car till my car was fixed. The SA very bluntly denied this request and told me they they ""do not have the concept of a loaner car"". I found this to be very strange and quite appalling that he did not even consider the request. This saga went on and every time I called the SA, he would just say the parts are yet to come. I began to lose my patience on this. The callousness of the SA was just atrocious. Multiple follow-ups were just met with the same answer. So I decided to reach out to their Assistant Service Manager. As soon as I appraised him of the situation, he did promptly follow up and check on the issue whilst taking it off the hands of the earlier SA. Finally, on the 16th of September, the ASM informed me that the gearbox had come and they would fix it and get it ready to be delivered by the 18th. My spirits did go up as I thought the ordeal would end here. But it was not the case. On the 18th, the ASM informed me that during a drive they had taken to check the gearbox before delivery, they found that issue still persisted a bit and they had to order another part, which would take another 10 days, to fix this. The ASM understood my frustration with the issue and as there was still no loaner car given, he promised that he would get all my cab expenses reimbursed for the time period that my car was in the workshop. This was a kind gesture, but I was still very pissed off about the whole situation. At my wits end, I reached out to the Bangalore chapter of Team-BHP and appraised them of the situation at hand. A big thank you to BHPians TurboGuy, vishwasvr and pastey93 for helping me out and putting me in touch with Vikram from the TORC Group. Vikram helped me contact the CCM for Ananth Cars. The CCM heard me out completely and was also shocked himself that no loaner car was given. The CCM apologized for all the inconvenience I was put through and explained that there has been a huge backlog in receiving parts from the Chakan plant and hence there were severe delays faced for many such situations. I did not know Mahindra were facing delay issues with normal spare parts, was only aware of the chip shortage situation. He did, however, arrange for a Marazzo for me as I had to travel out of town in a couple of days and I had no other car to drive. This was a very thoughtful gesture by the CCM and kudos to him for arranging a car for me at such short notice. As of today, the 1st of October, its been a month since my car has been at the workshop. I have been promised by the ASM that the car will be ready today and I can pick it up in the evening. I hope I am not let down at least this time. The service center has done its bit to appease me, but this level of quality and delay from Mahindra along with the initial refusal to provide a loaner car is simply unacceptable. A big thank you to this community again for giving me so many option to address my grievance. Hopefully, I can update this post with some good news by tonight.", 1st October 2021,mahindra-xuv300,Bangalore,6,22,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

600, Aditya_Dhull , 14:59 ,Newbie,"Hey Guys, I just returned to Mumbai this weekend after a 3000+ kms road trip with my wife and my dog. We went to Jaipur to meet my parents. While there, we went for another short, 4 hour road trip with them to Ramathra and now got back to Mumbai via Udaipur. In these two weeks there was a little bit of driving around in Jaipur city too. And I had to write this post to just tell you guys that it felt so damn good to drive this car. It's the Diesel AMT W8 (O) version and it was freaking fantastic. I do have many things I was disappointed about, like- really missed the rear AC vents with my parents riding with us, really missed a bigger boot, the engine sounds louder after the long trip, there are already a few rattling sounds behind the AC vents and a few more. But again, Oh My God it drives so damn smooth. It was a joy to take control of the wheel on the bends. It feels so smooth inside. Our dog, who otherwise is always restless in the car mostly slept throughout the whole 15 hour trip from Mumbai to Udaipur just because of the ride quality. We didn't get tired at all even after doing 15 hour stretches. The automatic gear shift made it so much easier to drive long distances while munching on snacks and drinking coffee. The manual shift option really helped in overtaking the irritatingly indisciplined trucks. This car might not have all the bells and whistles provided in the Kia and Hyundai cars, and it definitely has some issues like rattling sounds, errors in the reverse camera and general attention to detail problems (expected of a Mahindra) but it drives like a dream. It feels sure of itself and solidly planted on the road. We got the automatic because we thought we need something that's easy to drive in the city traffic. But during this trip I realised how much fun this car is when driven fast (I just hate the over speed alert sound). It's extremely distracting to have a non-stop beeping sound at that speed). Thanks to many of you on this forum for guiding me and helping me to make the decision to go for this car. I genuinely love driving it. Can't wait for another long drive honestly.

601, Aditya_Dhull , 20:16 ,Newbie,"Hi Rudra Sen, I didnt mean to promote unsafe driving. I drive at high speeds only when the road is clear, with seat belts on, both hands on the steering wheel (at 10 oclock and 2 oclock positions), only when Im feeling alert and only on short, straight, dry roads with no visible undulations. The Mahindra XUV300 overspeed alert system does a good job at alerting the driver to slow down. Thats why its such a safe car and safety was one of the main reasons I chose this car. It could have been a little less distracting is what I meant to convey in my previous post. Accidents are not caused by high speeds though. German highways are a proof of that. They are caused by silly mistakes and indisciplined driving. Im sorry if my previous post seemed to promote unsafe driving. That really was not the intention. I enjoy a little bit of speed though. It feels good. Theres something visceral about it. Thats one of the basic thrills of life an auto enthusiast is lucky to experience.

Saw that you test drove the XUV700. How does it compare to the 300? Since a vehicle is not allotted to me yet, thoughts of going for the 700 creeps in once in a while Would really appreciate if you could make a comparison, even though it'll be apple to oranges I drove the diesel manual on the 700. And incidentally, the test drive showroom and route was the same that I took for the 300 too. So it's a decent comparison overall. Here are my thoughts: I found the refinement levels to be lower than the 300. This came as a shocker to me as well. The test vehicle I drove for the 300 had 41000km on the clock, and was still more refined than this ~900km run 700. I could clearly feel engine vibrations on the clutch pedal throughout the drive, and every once in a while, some vibes on the steering wheel as well. And considering that even my 300 has yet to go through its first oil change, I do not believe that to be a point for the 700 either. The engine noise also climbs up a bit faster than the 300. Meaning, at ~2500-3000RPM, the 700 engine is definitely more audible than the 300's. That said, the engine is a heck of a performer. The 300 has a noticeable turbo ""spot"" at around 1500RPM where you suddenly get a chunk of the torque. The 700 doesn't have a spot as such. You get very clean and even acceleration throughout the rev range. I did hammer the engine quite a bit, and it responded very well. It's a fun to drive engine. It's especially fun to feel how nicely it can throw around that full sized SUV body. However, the overall performance is comparable to the 300, simply because it's a much larger car. 0-60, 0-100 are actually comparable on the two. I didn't see a dedicated button to manage steering modes, but the car does have that feature tied in to the drive modes. So there are 3 default drive modes, which can roughly correspond to city (Zip), normal(Zap), highway(Zoom). Zip is economy oriented and has the ""Comfort"" level steering setting. The engine response is also more dull here. By contrast, Zoom has the ""Sport"" level steering, with full 185bhp/420Nm on tap. Handling is about as sharp as the 300. My mid row passenger friends noted the suspension to be firm, but not too firm to be uncomfortable. There is noticeable body roll, which is way better controlled in the 300. But that's to be expected given the size, shape, and weight of the 700. The car is huge in dimensions, but doesn't feel that huge to drive and handle. Which is a good thing. Driver assists work fantastic, and seamlessly. I especially liked lane assist which automatically triggers at 60kmph, and has a nice layout on the console. Emergency braking also executes VERY well, and that too from a good safe distance. Auto hold function works way better than the HHA on the 300. Electronic parking brake button will take some getting used to. Electric seat adjustment is fun. Driving position is about similar to the 300 at the settings I am habituated to. The middle row is definitely more comfy, especially since you can recline the seats. Third row is just usable. No more no less. It's functional. Build quality is about similar to the 300. The panels are solid, and feel the same to touch as the 300. I found a couple panel alignments to be off, which I don't see in the 300. The interiors are way way better. I liked the faux leather stitched treatment on the dashboard, and the faux wood inserts on the door panels. The steering wheel spokes are finished in piano black, which looks better than the silver ones on the 300. The button layout is also far superior. In the 300, the buttons on the center console are thin and long, which can be easy to miss. The ones in the 700 are neatly squarish/rectangular shaped, and have good tactile feedback. Glove box is also pretty huge, just like the 300. The AC vents are sensibly placed horizontally. I hate the center AC vents in the 300. The steering blocks out about 30-40% of the air flow. AC blast and effectiveness is about the same. Note: middle row does not get any blower speed control. It is governed by the front row setting. The displays are amazing. Very clearly visible even in daylight. The driver console can be used for navigation! This is a brilliant feature. Stock music system is way better even on the non-luxury variant than the absolute basic one we get on the 300. That said, 300 getting auto-dimming center mirror, and a driver side mirror and vanity light, but the 700 not getting one, is a bit weird. Especially considering that the variant I drove is probably a full million more than the 300. Boot is pretty much non-existent in the 7 seater version. You can hardly keep maybe a couple of backpacks in there. And that's saying something considering that the 300 already has a pretty small boot. But I imagine the 5-seater must have amazing boot space. Overall, if I were picking even today, I'd still pick the 300 simply because I have no use for a third row and I do not want a 4m+ car. And the refinement was also a bit of a deal-breaker for me. A huge reason why I went for the 300 was purely because of how refined the diesel is, and not just for a diesel, it's about as refined as a lot of petrols!", 11th October 2021,mahindra-xuv300,Pune,552,789,"Steering, Handling or Ride",Very Positive

The petrol somehow felt less refined and lacked power compared to the diesel (could be a bad test drive vehicle). Also, I'm still not sold on the three cylinder petrols. The 300's handling impressed me. Coming from an Ikon 1.6, C-SUVs and SUVs didn't feel like good handlers but the 300 seems to have hit a sweet spot (although nowhere close to the go-kart like handling of the Ikon) between handling and comfort.

Although it's typical of a diesel unit, is that the case with all XUV3OO? The reason why I ask this is because Nexon has super light clutch which is a delight to use in traffic. 2. Many have said that the lack of rear AC vent is not missed much since the main AC is powerful enough. Folks who are using the car in hot/humid places like Kerala, Mumbai, Chennai etc., have you ever felt the need of vents in the rear seat? 3. Realistically, how many bags can be put in the luggage? When I checked the car, visually it looks like it can pack maybe 4 cabin or 2 big suitcases along with some backpacks. 4. Are the rear disc brakes also fitted with ABS?

I am still waiting for my XUV 300 W8 Petrol, but my 2 cents here: Its a decision from Mahindra to remove those featureand the dealer really doesn't have a role to play here. The important feature you're missing out is really just the 7th airbag. I don't know the purpose of the Door Ajar lamps - but if that is to warn vehicles coming from behind that the door is open - then a reflector would do fine really. As for the fog lamps - that could easily be fitted after market. You could obviously & easliy bargain on the insurance - thats where they make a killing. Get a quote from Acko and ask them to match it. They won't match that price but would surely bring it closer. Another thing you can bargain on is the Handling Charges. They do waive off in some cases. These day's i think there's a 20K exchange bonus - you get that amount discounted even without exchanging your old vehicle from them. I got that discount. As for Seltos - I thinks that car falls in to a different category. Comparison won't be fair. All the research i've done so far suggests the XUV having a very refined and superior diesel engine.

Or is it only front disc brakes? I also found the bite to be a little soft, couldn't get much feedback but the car does slow down comfortably. Do others also feel the same? Looks like the condition of the car that you drove wasn't very good. 1. The clutch is super light on this one.

However I normally do rev the engine as I always try to be in the power band so hopefully my style of driving will reduce these issues further. Even in hills that would still be fine. In hilly areas you end up driving at mid revs, or constantly varying revs. Both these things will keep the DPF flowing. It's only the Leh-Ladakh type extreme high altitudes and thinner air areas that will cause issues. And those issues have been seen against a lot of BS6 diesels from a lot of manufacturers. That's a design limitation. Since the engine is getting lesser air than it normally would, it's burning in lower oxygen than expected, and will generate soot faster. However a quick drive around slightly lower altitudes should reset it back in no time. I have literally spent about 30-45 minutes idling the car(to keep the AC running) waiting for my missus running errands in nearby city areas due to lack of parking spaces. That too on multiple occasions. If it can take literal idling for 30-45 minutes without throwing the DPF clogged light, it's good enough. This has been my personal experience.

653, krishnakumar , 19:12 ,BHPian," Quote: Originally Posted by professor.march So I have a question, what can we expect from an AMT? I have driven CVT and DCT quite regularly. It really depends on your usage. What are you going to use this vehicle for? I was lucky enough to find one TD vehicle with AMT at Sireesh Auto in Bangalore. I wasn't looking for an automatic because our city usage is limited but decided to give it a shot since it was available for TD and I had never driven AMT. In fact, this was the first XUV300 diesel TD that I did, so didn't have a MT benchmark. The experience was okayish. The first gear would always be revved up before it shifts but subsequent shifts are all short shifts. Also, because the car sits with a power unit producing that monstrous 300Nm, you get a ""lurch forward"" experience due to the turbo lag as there is no way to modulate power with clutch. I figured out some way to mitigate this by using the accelerator itself so it'll be a learning curve - certainly not intuitive. At sedate speeds, there is no gear change whiplash and it goes mostly unnoticed. But at even slightly spirited driving, you do notice the gear changes and your head will bob. Even if you take things in your control manually, it isn't as responsive as the DCT. It takes 2 seconds for it to change gears. Also, it doesn't allow upshifts if you're below a certain rpm; downshifts are allowed though. Overall, I didn't like the car in that format even without a benchmark. The TD with manual completely blew my mind and of course I ended up booking it. If your purpose is mostly highway commute with spirited driving across ghats etc, then MT is the way to go. If you're just looking at sedate city driving, the AMT does a pretty decent job; however, be prepared for a learning curve.", 27th October 2021,mahindra-xuv300,Bangalore,613,"2,660",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Positive

As I had previously hypothesised, DPF issues should be rare unless you are at super high altitudes, and driving at a sedate pace. On a separate note, the other day I got a smashing 19.8kmpl FE on my office to home commute! I work at Hinjewadi, and Punekars here will know what that entails. Road works, metro construction, bad patches, 2 signals, and a flyover. And this is just the first 5km of the commute. I was completely blown away by a solid 19.8 figure! This means that for my commute of 11km, I used up just above half a liter of diesel equating to about 50rs. Can't get any cheaper than this! On another separate note, the more details I observe, the more this car impresses me. I noticed that there was thermocol/foam padding inside the front fenders! This probably would have been done in lieu of NVH improvement, but I genuinely am impressed at the level of finer work that Mahindra has done on this vehicle. Add to that the foam padding on the inside of the wheel well, and the foam padding inside the door panels, they really wanted to make the cabin as silent as possible.

So I checked the manual for details on the airbags, and it seems like they are installed at the very top of the door sills. So the wiring was done at the bottom edge of door sills. The installing guys assured me that this wouldn't be a hindrance to the airbag itself. Also it was then that I discovered the ""Airbag"" placards on the pillars don't actually have airbags inside, but are place-holders/markers that hold a screw for the liner. I considered the roof-lining, but it would've been an equal hassle what with the sunroof up top. Above all this, the airbags are designed to burst open by breaking through the entire lining on that side. I hardly think a wire is going to stop that. The wire is open with some slack. There is some spare wire spooled around near the fuse box. As for the boot door, the wire was routed at the very center of the rear roof lining, and a small piece of wire left exposed in order to allow for expansion when the boot door is opened.

689, krishnakumar , 21:02 ,BHPian,"Hi all, I'm facing a niggle with Bluetooth in my new XUV3OO. So the way it presents itself is as below: The bluetooth discoverability of ICE goes randomly off at times; that is, ""Mahindra"" doesn't show up on any phone or other devices while searching for it. Even if we try to connect to ""Mahindra"" using the option under 'Previously Connected Devices', it doesn't connect. The bluetooth doesn't go off once a connection is established. That is, let's say the Bluetooth worked and I was able to connect it to my phone, during the entirety of that drive the connection doesn't fail. The bluetooth bug doesn't repeat systematically as mentioned in point 1. That is, not every time it goes off while restarting the car. Sometimes it goes off, sometimes it works just fine and connects automatically. I'd say the event happens with a 40% failure rate, roughly. Needless to say, since Bluetooth fails, Android Auto also doesn't connect during this time. The phone just charges during this time. The phone also doesn't provide any alert. During the events when bluetooth does fail, I tried toggling the bluetooth on/off in the ICE (via the 'Connectivity' settings) to see if it gets retriggered, but NADA! Once the bug presents itself, restarting the car also doesn't work. As mentioned in point 6, once the bluetooth fails the only way to get it working is by reseting the ICE. No other method seems to reinstate Bluetooth. Tried restarting the car, toggling bluetooth on/off, turned on/off the ICE etc. Nothing. Needless to say, the problem only presents randomly so I had a tough time convincing the service center guys. I took it to the service center and would you be surprised if I said the bloody car decided to work just fine despite trying my best to replicate it by turning the engine off multiple times. Nope. Worked just fine. I insisted on flashing the system even though they said the firmware is the latest. They obliged and did a flash. It worked fine again and I departed. The moment I reached home, the bugger was back. Reset the system and it worked fine. We were on a 750km trip last weekend and through the trip, the bug presented itself 3 times. Thankfully, I have video of when this happens. But still, the service center guys seem to be a bit clueless. Can someone please tell me if they faced anything similar? What can be causing this? I have not fit any additional accessory that should possibly tamper with this. Also, the problem came on the very same day of delivery. We did test for this specifically during the PDI at stockyard and it was all working fine. Even at the time of delivery it worked fine. It was only after we stopped for lunch and took it again later it failed. So there was no way we could have figured this out before taking delivery. Without bluetooth (and by virtue of that, the lack of Android Auto) the ICE is pretty much useless for me. And resetting the system everytime is not an option at all. I'm very VERY frustrated!!

I didn't face that issue. That is strange. I complained to the SA that my welcome and goodbye chimes are permanently enabled and the technician involved in flashing was sure that that is how it is supposed to be. And I am sure it is not the way because I have disabled all the sounds including the chimes on the delivery day and drove it for 20k km. So I am wondering if the software update is the culprit. It is not that it is impossible to live with, but it is just an annoying thing for me. And guess what after the flashing/update of parking sensor during the service? I took a 400km drive and there wasn't much rains or anything, but the rear passenger side parking sensor failed by the end of that trip! And after another 400km trip in heavy rains, it decided to fix itself. I am not sure what is happening with the parking sensors now. Have to wait and watch.

I was wondering how it was taken through the center of the roof liner by Ashish. The magnet is glued to the roof liner almost under the rubber beading. All the wiring is hidden under this beading as marked with arrows. The wire is tucked under the seat and taken through the slot without interfering the seat belt in the rear. When you remove the panel covering the rear tyre, you will see a big gap to accommodate this wire. It should work for any type of dashcam. I have a Chinese one from AliExpress bought some years back for a friend who didn't use it. I haven't hard wired it as I'll be getting a better one soon.

699, mihir_m13 , 13:13 ,BHPian,Just came back from a 700 Kms trip in my new W8 petrol. This was the second trip on the highway Baroda - Surat - Dahanu - Baroda. The first one was from Baroda to Malsar (On the bank of the Narmada) and back - 140 Kms. 2 trips in 17 days since delivery. The cars really very comfortable and glad i choose this over the Nexon. Suspension on not so smooth roads is way better than Nexon - the way i remember it from the TD's. We love the bigger cabin. I do find the clutch travel a little long though. Used the Cruise Control extensively (approx 60 Kms) on the Dahanu - Baroda (340 Kms) return journey and really it adds to a lot of comfort. And since there were rainy patches - used the rear wiper washer too and now i feel it was worth spending the money on a higher variant. The car has clocked a total of 1075 Kms so far and in the first 300 kms which was a mix of city and highway got a mileage of 15.6 Km/l (Fully loaded with A/c) and in the Surat - Dahanu - Baroda stretch - got 16 Km/l (A/c) driving in the 80-100 Kmph range. These 4 disc brakes is one feature of this car I love the most. Very effective. A/c I find average. Swift Petrol A/c was so much better. And this is cloudy weather am talking about.

Right from creating the job card to getting the car fully ready, the process was handled very professionally. One important point to note, while I was in the waiting lounge, I was told that there is a recall for a particular reverse cam error for my batch of cars (Nov 2020 - Feb 2021). I tried to ask for more details but could not get a detailed response. They said that they would check the wiring and the possible error while engaging reverse gear (apparently some users have complained of the screen going blank or showing a '?' mark). The overall process took around 30 mins I guess. They checked the wiring and plugged a laptop too. I did not go into the service bay as customers are generally not allowed. I was told later that my car did not display any signs of the fault and hence it is fine. I was billed around 2800/-. I asked the service advisor about any oil preferences, he clearly mentioned that oil to be used is Maximile Ultra (4 litres). I also opted for dash mats which looked cool (cost around 556/-).

You may want to purchase rubber mats for the boot floor - can easily get it after market. As for insurance - it can easily come down to Rs 30K.

The incidental charges even i've heard are illegal - but that really depends on your bargaining skill. As for the RTO charges - make sure - you get all the original RTO receipts.

Also had an opportunity to drive the petrol for a bit. Man that 200Nm packs a punch! It is very sprightly for a petrol. The acceleration is far more linear than the diesel, and low speed drivability is also pretty good. Refinement absolutely top notch, especially considering it's a 1.2 3 pot.

719, krishnakumar , 17:07 ,BHPian,"Hey XUV300 owners, I'm facing a few bugs/quirks so to speak and wanted to know if this is a common problem: 1. Bluetooth Bug: There is some bug with the Bluetooth and would not connect with the phone randomly. I had posted regarding this earlier on this thread (Mahindra XUV300 : Official Review). This randomness doesn't occur while it is operational. It only surfaces randomly whenever the ICE reboots itself. I tried reproducing this issue at the service center twice, on two separate visits, but it is just so random so the effort went in vain. The technical manager said that it has been widely reported and a new software update is coming which should fix it. Have others faced this error? 2. Rear Wiper/Washer Quirk This a rather annoying quirk I noticed with the rear wiper/washer and I suspect it's the BS6 models which have this behavior. The washer spray is slightly delayed which means that the wiper is already half way past by the time the water is sprayed down. What this means is that when the wiper comes back, it just cleans the water off the windshield without using it to clean. More like a double whammy. What's interesting is that at the service center there were 2 other XUV300s. The BS4 one was calibrated perfectly, the water spray would turn on first and then the wiper starts moving so that water is perfectly scooped up to wipe the windshield. Whereas, in the BS6 models (including mine) the wiper would move past. Note: It is unclear if the difference is due to models being BS4 vs. BS6. Logically it doesn't make sense, however, that's the only difference that the technical manager could point fingers to. Please see the video below: Video of the washer wiper working properly - it's a BS4 variant as per the SA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDcygT4HcTs Video of the washer wiper working properly - it's a BS6 variant as per the SA. My car's rear washer wiper works exactly like below which just seems so dumb. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0MZ28CkraY 3. Oversteer on rumble strips I have noticed a particularly surprising behavior in the XUV300 (and potentially risky as well). If we turn the car on rumble strips, the car has terrible oversteer and in many cases I believe it's the ESP that's keeping it pointed straight. I have reproduced this multiple times now to say that this is definitely a behavior and not a random event. It occurs even at speeds of 40kmph, so definitely not high-speed induced. Are others also facing this? What could be the reason for this? 4. Extremely sensitive cold brakes? The brakes are extremely sensitive during the initial 5-10mins of drive (from a cold start). Even small, light inputs to the brake brings the car to a sudden halt and causes whiplash. Couple of times it was so hard that my wife got sore because of the belt restraining her. Is this behavior normal? I have definitely not seen this with other cars.", 9th December 2021,mahindra-xuv300,Bangalore,613,"2,660",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
720, Eco_Driven , 20:31 ,Newbie,I have a XUV 3OO W8 O AMT purchased on 31st March 2021. I could not drive much in the initial months since the 2nd big lockdown started the next week I took the car. But after that till date have driven ~5000KMS and I must say it has been a awsome experience. Now coming to the Radio problem some people mentioned that the radio switches on as soon as they get into the car which is really annoying. I also faced this problem in the initial days. Many of you guys might mute it once you get in the car. I used to do the same. But that does not solve the issue. So the best thing would be to switch off the ICE totally before you get out of the vehicle. You can do that by pressing the button you use for mute for 2-3 seconds. So the ICE totally gets switched off and you can switch off the ignition and lock the car. Once you come ack and get inside the ICE does not switch on. I mean the screen is on but the ICE system is not on. You can then start it if required by pressing the same button. Then it starts in Radio. This cannot be avoided. I generally switch off the ICE before turning of the ignition. And when I start driving I only switch on if required or keep it in off condition. This will surely solve the annoying problem with radio starting automatically., 9th December 2021,mahindra-xuv300,Pune,12,22,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

While on rumble strips, the suspension keeps ""bouncing"" so to speak. At one of the positions, the tyres have very little grip, and hence turn easily. I suspect that's the oversteer effect you're referring to. 3. The cold-start brake thing, I have felt it a couple of times, but that's it. Could it be related to handbrake being discs?

I had read something along these lines. That is definitely my theory on the oversteer behaviour as well. However, wanted to know if others have felt the same. The cold brake seems to be because of handbrakes being discs. The SA asked me at what position I keep the handbrake while parking. I usually keep it at low-medium position, just about where it gets a little tight since I park on a flat surface. The SA couldn't really diagnose the problem with that though. He only suggest to pump the brakes a few times after cold start. Will try this the next time. Quote: Originally Posted by Goandiaries Have observed this in mine too. I thought this could be due to low wiper fluid levels in my tank. No it is unrelated. I tried by filling the tank to the max level and it still behaves the same way. The reason is that the washer pump is at the front. So when we push the wiper lever, both the pump and wiper motor turn on at the same time. However, for the pump to build the pressure it takes time. Ideally, it should be calibrated such that the wiper motor has a delayed start. Quote: Originally Posted by mihir_m13 In any case - was the service center able to fix it? Unfortunately no. It's not something they can fix since it deals with how the MBFM is coded. The only way to fix this is to get Mahindra fix this by updating their ECU for MBFM. The SA checked my MBFM version and it was up to date. He flashed it once to double check and the wiper still had the same behaviour. Please report this to your technical manager at the service center and push them for reporting this to Mahindra. I'm thinking of contacting Mahindra through WithYouHamesha or mails to also tell them of this bug. As an interim solution, the only option is clean the rear windshield once manually before we start driving so that the wiper blade isn't dusty.

743, RakeshMX3 , 19:57 ,Newbie,"I have been a reading Team-bhp forum for the past 4 years and never thought of writing down a post until now. My relationship with 4-wheel started in the year 2013 when I bought Maruti Suzuki Zen Estilo. I have recently taken delivery of XUV300 and thought of sharing my experience on this forum. Adding index for the ease of readers: 1) Background 2) Hunting 2.1) First Attempt (the Year 2019) 2.2) Second Attempt (the Year 2021) 3) Initial Ownership 4) Modifications Background: I am currently owning Maruti Zen Estilo, bought in Jan 2013. I love this vehicle, its easy to maintain, never broke in the past 9 years and very fuel-efficient. The engine (K10) is reasonably quiet and has a decent mid-range. However, the vibrations do enter in the cabin specifically on the gear lever and doors when idling. Its a very trusted horse but now more than 9-year-old, hence I decided to buy a new one which would offer better safety, performance, and interior space. I didnt want to sell the Estilo and decided to give it to my brother who now uses it to travel in and around my hometown. Hunting: Thanks to Covid, my hunting spanned across two phases  the year 2019 and the year 2021. First Attempt (the Year 2019) My hunt began around August 2019. I set a budget of 8.5 lakhs and wanted a good-looking petrol sub-compact SUV/Crossover. With this budget in 2019, I considered Venue (S-MT 1.2 Petrol), EcoSport (Ambiente 1.5 Petrol), Honda W-rv (S 1.2 Petrol) and Nexon (XM 1.2 Petrol). Been through all the available reviews and videos available back then and then started taking test drives. Heres my drive impression based on the test drives- Honda Wr-v: Big on space, would put some of its competitors to shame on sheet rear seat space Fuss free ownership, reliable petrol engine Good in-showroom experience Looks small like a hatchback Tata Nexon Went to a showroom in Hadapsar, Pune (now closed). When I stepped in, I could read the showroom staffs facial expression, everyone looked pissed off with the sheer idea of explaining a product to a customer for big 10 minutes. Sat there for 10 mins, everyone was on their mobile phone pretending busy. Went to the receptionist again asked her if someone can attend to me. A sales rep, with an extremely casual dress code then attended me (I am cool with any attire, just mentioning as every other showroom ensured their staff is decently dressed). I asked for a test drive. The sales rep wasnt very aware of the product. I took the car out of the showroom, the sales rep told me to take left after merely 500 mtrs, then one more left and then one more left and voila we are back in showroom parking. I asked for a long test drive to which the sales rep said they are expecting one more customer for a test drive, they will arrange a long test drive for a later day. I never received a callback. Car felt very solidly put together, the interior felt better than wrv. Drivability was much better than wrv. I didnt like the exterior styling though. Ford EcoSport: Went to Ford showroom on the same day Totally different experience compare to Tata showroom. It was very packed, still, I was immediately attended. Took a long test drive. Loved the drive. Felt well put together, steering set-up was something I never experienced before (my Estilo has very vague steering). Driveability was better than Nexon  maybe because it was the naturally aspirated engine. Space was very limited compared it Nexon though. I loved this vehicle but didnt finalise it then because around Sept 2019 I read 2-3 articles about Ford planning to wrap up their India business (which eventually turned true). My Estilo was also a discontinued product (Maruti pulled off the plugin in late 2013) hence I dont want to buy one more product that may be discontinued. Hyundai Venue: Was just launched then. Loved the design  looked handsome Turbo was beyond my budget and hence considered S1.2 variant. Somehow felt the space is better than EcoSport (width) 1.2 was not available for a test drive. In Sept 2019, almost decided to finalise Venue S1.2. Spoke with Hyundai sales rep, they had no offers/discounts on Venue being a new launch however offered to match policy bazaar insurance quote (~10 thousand less). In the last week of Sept, I had to business travel to Spain for 2 weeks. There I got a hint that I may have to travel again for a longer period this time. This made me cancel the booking. After 2 months, Spain saw a huge wave of covid infections putting a question mark on international travel. Later the covid became a pandemic putting an end to my travel and car buying. Second Attempt (Dec 2021) After 2 Covid waves, in late 2021 it became evident that this pandemic may continue for the next one/two years. Around Aug major IT companies started announcing back-to-office and that was enough trigger for me to start my new car hunt again. From Sept 2019 to Aug 2021, I became a very frequent team-bhp reader. This forum helped me broaden my understanding of automotive. This time around my priorities was safety (>4 Star), driveability and automatic transmission. My budget was 12 lakhs on-road and I evaluated Mahindra XUV300, Tata Nexon and Brezza as these were the three offerings in the subcompact SUVs with 4-star crash ratings. XUV300 AMT Pros: 5-star safety rating Turbo petrol engine packs a great punch. Acceleration is superb irrespective any gear spacious interior, can sit 3 adults Feels premium and has a great road presence Cons: Since its AMT, the gear shift can be felt though its quicker than Nexon. The AMT pause is there until 3 gear, post that the gear shifts are smooth Steering isnt very direct Suspension is good but not as great as Nexon Boot space and lesser ground clearance (compare to Nexon and Brezza) Nexon AMT Pros: 5-star safety rating Great steering set up. Although XUV300 has sports steering mode, it feels very artificial and still its no match to Nexon Suspension is great Ground clearance and reasonable boot space Extremely comfortable seats Cons: Engine is good but isnt as punchy as XUV300 The gear shift pause is more pronounced than XUV300 Still not liking rear looks Average showroom experience. Even this time the test drive was less than 2kms. Never received a call back from the showroom after the test drive. Brezza AT I wanted to test drive Brezza only after I am done with XUV and Nexon test drives. as both are AMT and then I would be in a better position to differentiate between the AT and AMT experience. But later, I saw some auto news regarding a facelift of Brezza is around the corners. My Estilo was discontinued by Maruti soon after I bought it and hence, I didnt want to buy another car whose facelift will be available within 4-5 months after purchasing it, hence I dropped Brezza. Initial Ownership I took a test drive from Silver Jubilee, Pune but they didnt have W6 AMT variant available with them. Later I enquired with Unnati Motors and they had one Petrol W6 AMT in white colour. The vehicle was freshly baked  manufactured on 27th Nov. I made the booking instantly and initiated the loan procedure with HDFC. The registration happened around Dec 14th and got a call from the showroom that I can get the delivery on Dec 16th. The showroom arranged a small pooja and celebration. I went there alone considering the Covid situation in Pune. The car was clean and was ready to hit the road. I completed the pooja and other formalities and started driving back home, thats where the distance to empty starts to show 4km. Drove down straight to the petrol pump and got the tank full. Till now completed 1000 km which include 70% highway drive from Pune to my hometown. My initial impressions are: On the highway, the AMT works brilliantly, except for the gear shift from 1st to 2nd, you would hardly experience the AMT delay. At parking speed, the performance feels spikey, making you nervous about manoeuvring the car at tight parking spots. Must be extra careful in applying throttle at low speeds. Sometimes the car moves quickly. Cornering up to 70 km/hr on a moderate bend feels confident. Per MID, the overall fuel efficiency is 16.3 km/pl for first 1000 kms which includes 70% highway drive. Wasnt expecting this good FE, very happy. Gear changes happen at 2000 RPM. For me, 100 km/hr in 6th year came at around 2100 RPM. The acceleration will put big smile on your face, specifically for those who are coming from a 1 or 1.2 litre NA engine.

746, surya.roy2010 , 10:55 ,Newbie,"I would like to open this thread by owing all senior BHPians my sincere gratitude. I extensively researched on this platform and studied the feedbacks by my fellow BHPians before heading out to buy my first car, an M&M XUV 300 W(8) Petrol variant. Here's what I experienced after driving/learning it for 6 months across various conditions. On road price : 12.87 lakhs Odometer reading : 4900+ Kms Highest range driven : 400+ Kms Highest speed : 140 Kmph Straight from the horse's mouth Had my first long trip done and there was no looking back. Realized that the ABS, Cruise Control and other engine features were top notch. The gear selection is great. Most importantly, the cabin is sound proof. Additionally, my Car's sweet spot turned out to be Revs between 1500 - 2000 and 60-80KMPH. Besides, I drove her continuously for nearly 6 hours in mixed road conditions covering 400+ KMS, AFE observed was 22 KMPL which beats the ARAI of 17KMPL. City driving conditions are little inefficient, not because of the car, but myself as I am really slow and a careful driver. AFE observed in city driving is between 12-15 KMPL. This vehicle reinforces confidence for amateurs like me. Background : Even though I obtained my driving license as early as 2014, I rarely drove. I had a phobia of not driving anybody else's car thinking that I would bump it somewhere on the road. To be honest, I live in Howrah, a densely packed and highly congested area where GT road is shared amongst Toto's, Rickshaws, Cycles, Motorbikes, Trucks, Buses and pretty much every vehicle that can get on the road. Moreover, this is a notorious area, alongside Kolkata where its effortless to get into an incident. This kept me demotivated. All the while I was in Kerala, working for an IT MNC for 4 years, I did some driving there thanks to the empty roads and highways. I had some experience in driving a Swift and a WagonR but that was it, a long gap of 7 years. The build up before purchase : After getting a Job at Amazon sometime in June 2021, I decided to buy a Royal Enfield initially that's when my elder brother convinced me to get a 4 wheeler instead and prepare for greater requirements as I am already 31. This is when all the research began. I initially shortlisted Thar, Brezza, Creta, Sonnet, Nexon, Altroz and Venue but only followed up with Sonnet. After some discussions with the Dealer, a lack of enthusiasm gripped me. That's when I discovered XUV 300 and started investigating. After a week's research and some skepticism, all the aforementioned options just disappeared. I came out to value the safety ratings, driving experience, engine configurations and comfort over all the flashy, modern, feature-full alternatives being provided by the competitors. I was comfortable with the backdated interior/infotainment system and lack of adequate boot-space. The ground clearance was still an issue but I convinced myself not to abuse the car and drive as sincerely as I can. Nonetheless, the superficial things lacking didn't demotivate me and I valued the car's capability over everything else. Despite somewhat making up my mind, there was a voice within me saying : ""Dude, get the Thar, Life's short, go for it don't think so much."" . I discussed my inner thoughts but one dialogue from my elder brother shook me off my day-dreaming. Test Drive M&M folks were located nearby, I gave them a call and went for a test drive; this confirmed all that I expected. I sat in the driver's seat and realized how comfortable it is and the glaring rage of red was blinding everything else on the road. Pretty satisfied, I came back and got the quotation from the dealer. He was charging me nearly 50K for the insurance, this is where I could have saved some 20-30k had I purchased a plan outside the dealership. It was a lesson learned, I made mistakes and acknowledged it. I decided to opt for 100% loan considering the need for retaining cash for my immediate future needs. The calculation for 7 years loan tenure put a price tag of approx. 16.5L, I realized that I was paying nearly 3.5L as interest for 7 years, but I was ok as I needed more take home from salary and kept the option of foreclosure on the table. Plot Twist Having made up my mind, I was coming out of the showroom that's when a Convertible Red Thar caught my attention which was displayed on the way. I jumped inside and asked the Sales Agent to take her out for a test drive. I experienced body-roll and the power of the vehicle, the glancing of fellow motorists and all that aura surrounding this beast. Back at the dealership, I called up my Consultant and asked her to know if they had Thar in the stock, that's when the waiting period of 7-8 months, maintenance, and operational costs gave me a reality check. Pretty disappointed, I decided to pursue the XUV and said to myself ""Let's have a family car, the Thar can wait for some other time."" Nonetheless, this disappointment was short-lived and I was convinced that XUV was the best decision that I could take considering my practical needs. Delivery & Initial Ownership As promised, the SC delivered my car within 14 days. All new, no defects. I did the PDI and finished all the paperwork to take possession. Day 1, I reluctantly took her out at dawn, had a driver hired for assistance as I was driving after a long gap and my confidence levels were record low. My mom and I were thinking of keeping a driver for sometime till I was set, but the hourly rates and first day experience motivated me to drive my own beast all by myself. Day 4. I realized that the car was too big for me to control and I had some issues in sensing the gap that needs to be maintained on the Left. Confidence was sinking as I started experiencing the nitty-gritty of maneuverability in pathetic road conditions first hand. Nonetheless, I carried on driving her slowly and carefully. Things settled down after 10-12 days when I gathered confidence of taking the National Highways. My 6 months weren't completely incident free, my beast received scratches and dents mostly due to carelessness of fellow motorists while I got myself a scratch due to gentle rubbing while parking. Such incidents I think pushes one towards defensive driving, and I think that's good as it can really reduce one's chances of accidents. For those who are planning to go for XUV 300, go for it. It's a top of the class car and best in the segment unless you're not a fan of superficial things like interiors, bootspace, infotainment system and all. Today, I did DIY painting and touched up the areas. The results are good; but please don't try this at home. Color matching is a painful activity and has it's consequences.

Most of M&M car's price got hike in second week of Jan and for 300 price revise did not happen I was thinking this because of declining sales figure, to my surprise SA told that price has been revised by approx 20k and will be effective on my booking as well. Yes I was aware that final price at the time of billing will be applied. I am currently driving Duster Diesel which is having 16"" wheel size and ground clearance is more than 200 mm, over this I have upgraded the wheel size to 18"" making the GC to more than 210mm. I never ever think about holes or potholes but I have to undergo Suspension replacement every alternate year. I have only concern with GC with XUV300 which has 180mm that too unladen.

Sure, they have great products and pricing but the feature deletion with price increase is a bad practice which I detest. The branch manager tried his best, but I had already decided to look for other vehicles. Also the executive didn't do his part of informing me about price hikes. It's as if once you book the vehicle they take you for granted. I booked Sonet diesel automatic since I found it to be well rounded to drive and convenient in the overpopulated urban jungle called Bangalore.

753, Duckdoc , 20:56 ,BHPian,"Update: 20000 km with a March '21 XUV 300 W8 OPT Diesel MT It's a little over 10 months since I bought a BS 6 XUV 300 W8 Opt and I see the thread has gone quiet, so I am posting my experience of 10000-20000 kms with it. Having sorted out my issue with the 3 point rear middle seat belt earlier, I thought I would be at peace but there were 2 issues which kept bugging me till it was resolved almost at 20000 kms. The first one was the stock MRF Ecotred tyres. Not only was it noisy, there was hardly any grip. Unfortunately, in a tier 2 city there were no takers in the tyre market early on as it was r17 rims. Besides as I had to make multiple trips to Chennai on roads which were a disgrace to be called highways, I thought I would put up with it, as I presumed MRF would have less wear, until there was an excuse. Fortunately, lo and behold, after a 2000 km trip during the last week of '21, I found a nail embedded in the juxta side wall and changed 2 tyres to Conti, put them in front and got wheel balancing and alignment done. My plan is to change the other two also to Conti after another 5000 kms. The difference in noise and grip is phenomenal. The other bug bear was the sound system, as highlighted by multiple users. It produced tinny, flat sound with no bass. I tried convincing myself that it was sufficient but honestly, it was pathetic. The last straw was when I was sitting as a passenger in my daughter's 3rd gen City bought in 2010 after a long time and listening to music, it sounded so much better and I could no longer live with this noise maker. I did read the following threads many times before deciding what to do: https://www.team-bhp.com/tech-stuff/...audio-installs https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/car-e...elp-gurus.html (Mahindra XUV300 ICE upgrade - Need some help from the gurus) I did come to a sort of compromise, not resort to a very high end install but nevertheless have a reasonably good one. After a lot of research, as the install had to be professional, I got it done at Museek in Trichy. These guys are passionate about their music and a pleasure to be with and so got it done last week, with Alpine r series speakers and DrArtex damping of the 4 doors. I never realised damping could make such a difference. To test their install, the first two tracks I played was 'Honky Tonk Women' and 'Stairway to Heaven' by the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin respectively and I was blown away as it was the difference between night and day. They told me to try this for 6 months and then decide about a further upgrade with a DSP Amp and subwoofer, if required. As most of my trips late last year, especially to Chennai was in rainy weather and slush, the rear windshield was being spattered with mud and I made this mud flap extender inspired by the thread below: https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/test-...xm-petrol.html and I must thank @gmhossain for this which made a lot of difference. I also got some mats for the boot and to protect the fabric on the back of the rear seat and a nice touch from Mahindra, 11 piece dash mats. One of the main reasons in buying this vehicle was to travel on all kinds of roads, something which I did quite a bit. My first ghat road trip was to Kothagiri in October with 5 adults and luggage and it pulled uphill without any effort or need to downshift more than if I was the only occupant which was very impressive. Views from Kodanad view point near Kotagiri These 10000 kms were mostly on roads which were bad, to put it politely. There was a trip to Chikmagalur dt. last month where the road had disappeared in some parts. I had to drive from Belhonnur back to a homestay near Mudigere late at night where guided by Google maps, was for sometime on mudtracks and for a large part being the only vehicle on the road. One of the problems of being in this forum is reading about instances of being stranded in the middle of nowhere. As this section was largely deserted and as there was no signal and in pitch darkness, the above thought was there at the back of my mind but fortunately there was no incident. Coffee, coffee everywhere and kayaking at a homestay near Mudigere I had never visited the Koonthankullam bird sanctuary, so with a few relatives who are birding enthusiasts went there last month on a trip down south. Unfortunately, as there was not much water till the last year, there were few birds but we actually saw them closer on the fields nearby which entailed bad roads guided by Google maps but this is where the XUV came into its own as if looking forward to this.

We got the car within a month after booking it due to some contacts and the rest of the dealership experience was great. They delivered the car on the promised day with a small ceremony. Initial driving experience was mixed as its our 1st automatic vehicle and its an AMT. However both me and my wife got used to it in a couple of days and she really likes it now. The car is roomy and the interiors are functional yet modern. But mahindra has removed the touchscreen unit and the armrest from the W6 model which is a big disappointment.

We had a similar problem replacing my wife's Micra with a safe crossover that can be used for outstation trips and on bad roads.

The only compromise there was our lack of money. MG Astor was not released at the time or we would have considered the lower - mid variants. Honestly, I feel its choosing the compromises you can live with. Assuming you are choosing only among the safer cars, the biggest plus point of XUV300 in my opinion would be it's comfort over any kind of roads.

Dealer counters with "" we cannot replicate this"" or ""there is no error"" 2. Engine switching off and refusing to start for 10 to 15 mins, seems like some heat related sensor/wiring etc issue.

793, Duckdoc , 21:52 ,BHPian,"One year and 24000 kms: While some upgrade from a Honda City to the Germans, I was looking for something to be driven on bad roads short of off roading, something rugged and also for a car not spending a lot of time with the mechanic, to be trouble free and with a good safety record. Thus, I got a XUV 300 W8 O dual tone aquamarine MT Diesel on March 12th, 2021 which was delivered home at 8 pm. Soon after delivery Some thoughts about the MT: If there was a good TC/ trouble free DCT available this might not have been written. My driving style is not suited for an AMT. I like to be in control of the car all the time. Acceleration is very important to me in city traffic or on highways. I love changing gears, whether engine braking or accelerating and I love how this engine responds. And some contrarian thoughts: Being on the wrong side of 55, having had 14 surgeries on the left knee, being in some discomfort all the time and as someone who treats knee injuries I've found that working the long clutch pedal good therapy. While most of the driving was on highways, I've driven across the length and breadth of Chennai multiple times in horrible weather and roads, besides being stuck in bumper to bumper traffic especially near Sriperumbudur upto an hour I've found the gears easy to shift and trouble free. My daily commute to work and back is only 14 kms and most of the mileage was after coming back from work at around 5 pm on Saturday and coming back on Sunday evening. The first long trip of around 3000 kms was in April, along the coast from Pondy to Kanyakumari and back which gave a lot of confidence about going on and on especially on bad roads. The mileage has improved and once gave 19.9 km on a 300 km trip and I'm not a sedate driver by any means. On the way to Chennai Things I added/ changed: Got a new speaker system. Installed front and rear dashcam. Got new boot mats as we have 2 dogs. There was a sidewall puncture at 20,000 kms and I got UC6 Conti tyres for the front. I plan to change the other two also soon as the stock MRF Ecotred while it may last longer has problems with grip. The wipers were changed at 20000 kms. In a tier 2 city, the ASC guys have been friendly and accomodating. I plan to change the spare to r 17 and they got a tyre and tried it which fit in my bootwell and waiting for the steel rim from Boodmo. The maintenance cost has been minimal with only the oil change. I was worried about the light interior but it has been easy to maintain. The brakes had a disconcerting sharp bite initially which is not there now. The one thing I am worried about is the blindspot of the A pillar. While I always look on either side while turning right, a stationary person is still an issue especially in the dark. I've also found the fog lights to be of use to illuminate the sides especially on the moonscape of the Chennai-Kanchipuram section at night with unmarked lanes and unlit to be able the median better. The boot space is not a problem for me and well compensated by more than a few commenting on how comfortable the rear seat is even with 3 adults. Overall, I am happy with the performance and having had to visit the ASC only for routine maintenance. Odo on 20th March Driving this has been a pleasure and a stress buster and as they say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the mileage tells the story.", 25th March 2022,mahindra-xuv300,Tamil,108,659,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

798, RakeshMX3 , 18:46 ,Newbie,"Here's my initial ownership review after completing closed to 3000 kms in 3 months. I bought the XUV300 W6 AMT in Dec 2021 from Pune. The 1st month of ownership was great, the vehicle ran very well and certainly met my expectation. However, in the 2nd month the problem started. Due to some health issues of my mother, I had to come to my hometown Aurangabad and since mid-Jan working from here. Below is the series of vehicle failure I experienced in the month of Feb: Feb 5th, 2022: I was travelling with my family in town area to buy some stuff. Once the shopping was done, the car refused to start. The remote was not working, the engine was not starting and the dashboard was showing transmission malfunction error continuously. I had to then call the road side assistance and get the car tow to nearest service center. At service center, the service adviser inspected the issue and noticed some issue in the fuse box and fixed it. The car started and then I took it to home. Feb 19th, 2022: The same error transmission malfunction appeared. Again the car refused to start. This was around 9pm when I was to take my mother from hospital back to home after her chemotherapy cycle. I was about to call RSA again to toe the vehicle but decided to crank the engine one more time and it worked. The car started I was able to take it to home. The week of Feb 21st was extremely busy for me, hence I couldnt take the vehicle to service center during weekdays. On Saturday, Feb 26th, I took the vehicle to service center, however the service advisor said he is very busy today and the car would need to drop in the service center for 2 days and I was told to get the vehicle to them on Tuesday, Mar 1st. Mar 1st, 2022: I was to take the car to the service center, however again the transmission malfunction error came on the dashboard and car was not starting. I again had to call RSA and get the vehicle to the service center by towing. They kept the vehicle there for 2 days and called me and confirm that there was an issue with one of the fuse in the fuse box. They said this is resolved and I wont face this issue ever. Since Mar 1st, I havent received any issue, however, for 2 weeks I was extremely scared to take the vehicle anywhere. I am certainly worried and sceptical now on the quality checks that MnM has, a vehicle which is merely 2 months old, need to tow twice is utterly shameful for a company such as MnM. I had also contacted MnM customer care but all they did was fwd me to the service center. Service experience MS vs MnM: I owned Maruti Zen Estilo for 9 years and surely found it more professional compare to MnM. In MS service centers I felt I am dealing with an institution which has certain process checks, whereas at MnM I had to keep chasing the SAs, if I dont stand on his head, he will slow down . Would I still recommend XUV300? absolutely! The engine is certainly a gem of a machine, its been 3 months now and it still puts smile on my face on open highways. Quick overtakes still needs some planning due to the AMT gear-shift pauses. In city, at ~10 km/hr speed, I still find the acceleration uneven to the throttle response, the best way here is to keep sufficient space between the next vehicle.

802, asitmonty , 18:16 ,BHPian,"Hi All, I am scheduled to get my car delivered in a week and am working through warranty for Mahindra, as well as buying theSHIELD extended coverage . The amount for SHIELD is pretty low (13k) but is that really worth it? I don't mind paying even 50k if there is value in that expense, and not just for the ""peace of mind"" logic. I am hoping some experienced members here would have better insights into questions that I have. In addition to your opinions, I would really appreciate if you have any sort of links or sources for me to check further. 1. Authorized service center -The warranty does state that it will be void unless serviced at an authorized service center. I used to own a car in USA, and even though manufacturers had the same line, courts had ruled that as long as services were performed by a certified mechanic, it doesnt have to be an authroized one. Does any of you have come across similar ruling/scenario in India? My primary concern is that I know dealers make most of their money on servicing and accessories margin. And that is sort of their top incentive to charge what they want. A typical oil change for my i10 costs 40-50% more at dealers than at a local shop. 2. Modifications - After reading reviews and recommendations by XUV300 owners on team-bhp, I am considering changing the headlights, speakers, horns, etc and maybe even add a dashcam and boot light. Though small items, some may need a direct wiring into the panel. Does that void warranty if not done at dealer? 3. SHIELD Warranty - Now in general, extended warranty is debatable. If things didnt go wrong in 3 years of purchase, the likelihood of those happening significantly drop. But on top of that, SHIELD only covers mechanical and electrical failures, and they have this huge list of items it doesn't cover. My big question is - what is left to cover? And whatever is left, is it going to cost more than 13k in the 2 years duration? https://www.withyouhamesha.com/tnc/shield_terms_and_conditions.pdf I already checked articles on Forum including the below two posts, but not fully clear from those. https://www.team-bhp.com/advice/exte...ties-yes-or-no https://www.team-bhp.com/news/does-i...-cars-warranty I must add that this community has given me so much of knowledge about cars in general.

I'll try to answer your questions though am not an expert but only with the experience of having driven a XUV 300 for a fair bit in a little over a year. 1. The ASC is reasonable and the app gives you an estimate so there is very little wiggle room to be overcharged. 2. Try doing all modifications after asking the ASC as if anything goes wrong you have to end up going there. 3. While things not covered by the SHIELD warranty have been highlighted, it does cover mechanical and electrical failure which is reasonable for the amount charged. Ultimately, the aftersales experience depends on the relationship with the ASC.

Take it from someone who bought the extended warranty exactly for the ""peace of mind"" and then finally has extracted full value out of it. To address your points: 2. I have aftermarket amps, speakers, subwoofers, low beam HIDs, dashcam, aux lights but when it came to issues with the HeadUnit, Mahindra was ready to replace it, no questions asked. I have had couple of items changed during the routine warranty and during the extended warranty: gearbox, clutch pedal, master cylinder, shock absorbers are what I recall from the top of my head. Just ensure you are not cutting any of the existing wiring. M&M dealers don't really fret over addition of fuse taps or extended wiring. 3. Mahindra is pretty liberal w.r.t warranty claims, BUT you need to have that extended warranty to eligible once your factory warranty expires! Most of the items that it does not cover are part of routine maintenance. Yes, the likelihood of things going bad after the three years drops, but like you already mentioned, replacement of parts is pretty costly and even 1 or 2 part changes will recover the entire cost of the ext warranty.

Having owned a 2011 Ritz earlier, test-driven nearly all the cars in the sub-15L range and owned a XUV300 W6 AMT for the past 9 months, I would recommend the XUV300 without any hesitation. If I were to compare it to the Brezza, here's how I would see it:Service: My experience with Mahindra has been as good as it had been with Maruti. While the parent company (Maruti) has been responsive, I have had mixed experiences at Bimal Motors and great experiences at UM Cars (Domlur). So far at Mahindra, both India Garage and PPS Motors have been good to me. Build Quality and Safety: A coconut fell bang on the bonnet of my XUV300 a few weeks ago. There was a dent for a short while but it straightened out by itself on my way home. Brezza might be the safest-rated vehicle from the Maruti stable, but I am not sure it might be as good. Value for money: I lucked out by buying the non-touchscreen W6 variant during the semiconductor shortage, reducing my OTR by INR 1L. Brezza (the pre-facelift version) was even then the costlier option for the AT variant. Waiting time: A car in hand is better than one just booked, if you ask me. With prices being hiked frequently, and especially more so when it comes to popular models, it's better to get your vehicle before the hikes push it to the very edge of your budget. Comfort: As a driver, I am a fan of the XUV. I've had multiple day-long trips (750+ kms) without feeling the strain. The turbo petrol has done everything asked of it on highways. The TD I took of the old Brezza, on the other hand, was a disappointment because the 4-speed AT+engine combo just did not seem like it had the lungs to respond quickly. Given the initial feedback for the new Baleno and XL6/Ertiga, if the same new engine is ported over to the Brezza, you might be in for a more sedate ride than you might like. Bootspace: This is where the XUV300 takes a massive hit. I ended up installing a roof carrier when we had the whole family on a trip. Brezza, if I am not wrong, might not have needed the capacity expansion. That said, I am not sure if Brezza will come with load-bearing roof rails - if it doesn't, it does limit your options should you ever need them in future. As things stand now, there are a few things that you can't know about the new Brezza until you do a proper TD and put it through its paces. But if the reasons you had for finally deciding in favor of the XUV300 still hold true, you might be better off going for it.

The engine, features and most of all the safety available on the XUV is unparalleled. It's a solid built SUV and would be a better deal than the Brezza IMO. While looks are subjective, the XUV is one of the handsome looking cars. I have never regretted my decision to go with the XUV. The M&M service centers have improved by leaps and bounds. I have had a great experience thus far.", 27th May 2022,mahindra-xuv300,Hyderbad,985,"3,460",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

If you think you'd feel that about the new Brezza, then you should wait. But trust me, you'd want to turn back and look at the XUV300 as well. It's a gem of a car, performance numbers are the best in the segment (even better than the non-turbo Creta), safety is the best in the segment, width is the best in the segment, all 4 tyres have disc brakes (only in the segment), highest wheel base in the segment and thus provides the least body roll with well planted drive on high speed highways and turns. Sir, mine is a Nov, 2020 W8 (O) dual tone. I wanted to check out a roof carrier for the car just in case there is a long journey planned. The lesser boot space was definitely not a deal breaker for me as all the weekend trips are easily manageable.

Mild inconvenience one might say, but losing out this feature by a month is what itches. Coming to BS6 diesel engines. I had a mild scare with my car's DPF clogging, but this was mostly my fault because I hadn't done any highway driving in over 3 months and was using the car exclusively for short city runs (which is a big NO-NO for BS6 Diesels). The car gave a warning and after a short drive, I came back home and did a Park Regen and it was immediately fixed.

And I started totally confused with the huge number of make/model options, insurance terminology, confusing process. Eventually, I decided that a bigger car would be nice (My dad had a hatchback - i10), but not the full size since it is too expensive and would be a little tight for my small garage. After quick initial reading around, decided to check 5 models under the 15L price point that I had - Nexon, XUV300, Brezza, Urban Cruiser and Venue. My ride with Brezza and Urban Cruiser was ok. The interior was average and overall didn't feel great about either. Venue was a bit better overall, but the rear seats felt too tight, and so did the handling. Nexon and XUV300 were definitely the winner from the test drive phase. Between Nexon and XUV300, Nexon - Pros: 1. Very attractive prices - almost 1L lower than XUV300. 2. Boot space - bigger than XUV300 3. Sportier look than competition. Especially with the new Kaziranga. Cons: 1. The bigger Boot space results in tighter spacing between rear seat and front seats. With the front seat retreated to accomodate a 5'10"" guy, the knees of riders in the back would almost touch the front seat. My i10 has a better spacing compared to Nexon. The drop in knee space for rear passengers is obvious, given the extra boot space within 4m, compared to xuv300. 2. Curvature of the rear portion of roof results in much smaller gap between the head and roof, if you are taller than avg. I am 5'10"" and there was barely a fist sized gap between my head and the roof. My i10 has a bigger gap.If your rear passengers are 5'6"" or shorter, or if you are going to have kids in the back most of the time, you can consider the car. 3. black interior roofs, makes the space feel smaller. XUV 300 Pros: 1. Extra curtain airbags and ESC. I saw the link where impact on occupant safety due to side airbags was highlighted. We take highway trips (2-3 hours drive) every 3 months or so with my little girl in the back (she doesn't get into car seat). So, this felt important. Check these two posts for some relevant research material https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/suvs-...ml#post5185816 (Mahindra XUV300: Should I go for the Option Pack or not?) https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/suvs-...ml#post5189548 (Mahindra XUV300: Should I go for the Option Pack or not?) 2. Better seating space, gap between head and roof. Because of the flat design of roof, unlike Nexon's sloped, that extra fist size room makes the difference. 3. Less sporty, more SUV feeling 4. The sexy wheels - if you look at silver alloys vs diamond cut, chances are you will get the O trim just for its wheels Cons: 1. Boot space is less. Though for practical purposes (specific to my case), it is big enough to fit a couple of large duffel bags, supplies and chairs for a trip to the beach. I don't plan to go on drives longer than 12 hours, so it is not a big botheration for me. For those occasional trips to airport to drop any of the US bound relatives, I can fold one side of the 60:40 back seat and fit in upto two additional big suitcases. Else, uber those 1 or 2 trips. 2. Expensive by 1 lakh, though still not overpriced 3. There is a huge gap in features between W6 and W8 (top trim). So, you are sort of forced to opt for W8(O) Price I have already summarized pricing details at top. Some additional info below. Possible discounts and timing: Dec - Feb : about 30k now (used to be close to 70k if you are lucky before the semiconductor shortage) Mar - Jun : about 20k price increase : for 2022, it was in May There is at least one BHPian from Chennai, who got 70k waived off in Dec 2020 (didnt save the post link). With the semiconductor shortage, and the pouring orders, right now no discount is going on. However, if you plan to buy a Mahindra towards year end (Dec/Jan) when they offer big amount on previous year manufactured cars, consider the overall loss. For a 12L vehicle, When you sell your vehcile after, say, 10 years, the drop in value per year is about 60k. Unless the dealership is offering that much in savings, it is a loss. More detail with pretty charts - https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/offic...ml#post5210654 (Mahindra XUV300 : Official Review) Big decision related to expected new models - Should I get the car this year, or wait till Apr 2023 to get the new upgrade that every car site is talking about?? With XUV700 at 90 weeks delivery, and current 300s at a 13 weeks delay, I am skeptical about how long the 2023 XUV will take to be delivered. On top of that, at the rate Mahindra is raising prices, it is likely they would another 50k to the new model. So, at the end, decided the new logo, looks and features is not worth waiting a full year, year and half and paying 50k more. Though if recession hits, it may likely go cheaper. Negotiating with dealer: 1. Logistics charges of 4000 I pointed out to SA that it is an illegal charge as declared by various high courts, but his dealership couldn't care less. I would have pursued it though if they would have forced me to pay. But fortunately, I got lucky here. Twitter to my rescue: I dropped a tweet tagging Anand Mahindra. In 48 hours, the GM at the dealership called. Tried to give me theories around why the 4k is a justified charge. I was polite but firm about not paying the charge. At the end, he declined to waive it and disconnected. Calls me back in a few hours and informed that as a courtsey, he will waive the handling charge. I am guessing, Mahindra has some sort of customer satsifaction targets for each dealer, and the dealership decided that the value of that is much more than my puny 4k. Good for me. https://twitter.com/asitmonty/status...9AMjnPmNlR9E-Q https://twitter.com/asitmonty/status...9AMjnPmNlR9E-Q 2. Insurance - Dealer quoted 45k for insurance through IFFCO Tokio. When I checked online, IFFCO quoted 25k. Even the 2nd most expensive quote was 33k only. Though it was still confusing with so many insurers and a big price gap (lowest at 16k all the way to 32k). I did some data anlaysis using IRDAI data (from their website) and grouped the insurers by their claim settlement ratio and rejection ratio. Not surprisingly, the insurers with low settlement ratios also were the ones with the low prices. At the end, I picked within the top 5 insurers, despite the relatively high price. If I get into an accident, I would be unhappy enough. Minimizing the collection pain is likely worth the extra bucks. Within the top 5 insurers: HDFC Ergo - I picked this finally for approx 36k (for IDV - 1176291 + RTI + Zero Dep) Bajaj Allianz - Most expensive Oriental - Website Quote is not user friendly. So, likely claims process is not completely digital. Though i couldn't confirm Royal Sundaram - Overall good, but they dont have Return to Invoice cover. SBI General - Same problem as Oriental. Online quote cannot be done with Chassis. And their online sales team really sucks. Once I decided the insurer, I told the dealer that I will get my own. They kept on justifying a policy through the dealer claiming it will make claims easier and faster. When I asked how would it help given the claim is now done through the mobile app and the insurer will send their own claim investigation person anyway, they just blabbered and had no clue what to say. Finally, they gave up and told me they will match whatever quote I have from online. So, now I get a policy through the dealer for 2/3rd of the price they originally quoted and got a better insurer than they planned to have for me. Oh, and the additional discount of 5k they had promised earlier, apparently that couldn't be done anymore. I guess that 5k discount for 'feel good' was from the extra 20k they were charging me for insurance. I have posted an infographic that puts all insurers in a visual friendly manner using claims settlement ratio at this link. I hope it helps the ones like me who are new to this. - https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/india...ml#post5189927 (The 2020 thread: Your preferred car insurance company & why) 3. Shield warranty - a few of the reviews on Team-BHP had mentioned that it is better to get shield through the withyouhamesha app. So, verfiied and stuck to that option. Was cheaper by 2k compared to dealer's quote. The actual purchase on app took 2 minutes. PDI - The SA was reluctant for PDI and gave all sorts of reasons - against company policy, nobody does that, our Service Manager will do the PDA so you dont have to worry, and so on. But thanks to Team-BHP, I stood my ground and he finally relented. Took the checklist printout, and went through it page by page (about 80% covered). And it definitely is a must do. There was nothing big, but maybe about 10 minor things. A minor scratch on the bonnet, 2 or 3 weird marks on body, another 4 or so minor dirt marks inside. On every single item, the service manager either made an excuse or said 'it is like that'. But eventually said they would address it. (though the service manager fixed some and left others, so its better that you make the service manager write down the list, or at least whatsapp the list directly to him) Few observations: 1. Download the Blue Sense Connect app before you show up. Helps you test the car Entertainment system, as well as you can see the trip details made by your car (in case it was driven around more than it should have been). Though I did it during the PDI, so it isn't a big deal if you have a good LTE connection at the PDI location. But still safer to get it before you leave. 2. Think about your accessories before you go for the PDI. I had already gone through the available accessories listed on M2All and the brochure that SA shared on whatsapp. After the PDI, I talked to my SA and got the prices for the ones I was interested in. I looked at some of the accessories that were getting fitted for 2 cars, and that helped clear my choices a bit. Mahindra has a nice website to check accessories look on the car. I played around on this site https://www.mahindrasyouv.com/3d-dis...ahindra-xuv300 Loan Mahindra finance offered me 7.2% (as of May 29 2022) fixed with 5k processing fee, whereas ICICI did 7.2% fixed with 5k processing fee and Union bank 7.4% variable with 3k processing fee. I confirmed with Mahindra Finance. But on the day of PDI, when I went to finalize the papers, turns out MahFin wants 6k insurance for the loan as well. Even though when I had asked him to list every single fee, he conveniently skipped that. Some members in my family were like - you are paying 14L already, what's another 6k. And they are right, 6k is not a big amount. It's more around, if the company is sneaky enough to do this, what else have they got hidden in that contract? I was sort of prepared mentally to walk out if this happens, and that's what I did. Reached out to ICICI, and they processed it at the promised rate. No hidden charges. Plus, it took just another 2 days. When I have waited 3 months, what's another 2 days? Final amount payment and InvoiceAs recommended by BHPians, I double checked all entries and turns out the Engine number was entered wrong. Just one letter, but obviously that would have been a pain if it got submitted to RTO. The SA was a bit reluctant to accept his mistake (this was something that regular customers wouldn't catch, but yay to TeamBHP). Finally, he accepted and fixed it.Accessories - I went for about 37k of accessories. 26k from Mahindra - Intense Chrome Set - 10,880, SS rear bumper guard - 4,800 parcel tray - 1,795 Illuminated Door Sill- 2,400 anti-skid dash mat, front and rear mud protector, body side moulding set, bumper corner protector set, fender garnish, door edge protector - total 4,950 Front middle grill garnish - wasnt available so have to do it later And then another 10k from Amazon 1. Hi Art PVC, Faux Leather 7D Beige car mats- ₹ 5,700 https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07D2G4V96 2. Hi Art Rear Waterproof Tray Boot Trunk Mat - ₹ 2,000 https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B08BPC95CZ Hi-Art is really owned by this guy Pulkit from Delhi (probably chinese orders). If you buy direct from his website mats cost 4950 instead of 5700. Though, it has its own risk (I ordered through Amazon since the returns with Amazon are less-hassle).

That, in addition to taking a glance whenever you got a chance (during showroom visit, or parked XUV's on road, or even one that would cross us on a drive) was very helpful in getting a true sense of how good/bad it looked Delivery The SA initially offered us to take the delivery at 4 pm on Friday. But I went with TeamBHP recommendation, and asked for Saturday morning. And it was a very useful decision. Nobody was in a rush, and they had a problem tracking my payment, so it took a good 1.5 hours from arrival to departure. I had been given 10:30 am, and based on my previous experience with their tardiness, I called them up at 10 to confirm. As expected they hadnt even started anything, I was asked to come at 11. To get the final payment for accessories, checking all reciepts/warranties - overall it took 1.5 hours at the showroom. So, plan accordingly. For the demo, I was asked by the receptionist during the final handover and when I said I havent got any yet, they said they can have a person come over to our place and do the entire demo (electrical, mechanical options, etc - the full deal). So, I have one coming in next week. I haven't asked if it is free though, but I think it is. As @SMG recommended, I had ordered from a nearby shop and took about 20 breakfast packets of snacks to share some happiness. Their sales floor have about 8 employees. Don't know if it did spread some happiness, but at least I sure felt good about it. A hearty thanks to for putting up that guide for buying process.

If you reduce your cruising speed to 75-90kph, you might see a jump in mileage to 19-20 kmpl on flat highways.

Welp, 17.2L on-road for the XUV300 is just STEEP. I will not be able to digest that despite loving my car to bits. Also, the TC gearbox is just wishful thinking in my opinion. There is no guarantee on one actually making it to the car. As for the dated interiors, my point of view is completely different. Yes it is dated, but who cares? You will rarely look at the center console because you'll be thoroughly enjoying the drive out there! And trust me, dated it might be, but it is extremely functional - much more than all of those touch-sensitive buttons and what not. A total no non-sense center console that makes the driver's life VERY easy while driving. In fact, the functionality of the center console is one of the key things that made me tilt towards it. But let me throw a curve ball at you. With a 20L budget, you might be able to get much better options from the used car market which is hot right now. I did a quick search for used cars on Olx in Hyderabad for diesel automatics under 5 years and there are plenty of great options. Do check it out if you're anyway ready to wait.

Just curious. If your driving is overwhelmingly highway or rural areas, I could maybe understand that. But then if the area itself is poorly lit, even average headlights will seem much brighter to the eye due to the way our eyes adjust. I would really suggest not to just go for the brightest possible option especially for the lower beam. It completely blinds the traffic in the other lane and makes driving very difficult for them, while not providing that much of a use in terms of raw illumination. I feel like we as a driving community should be more conscientious of our decisions and how they might potentially affect others. Especially since it would be an overkill in most situations.

To answer your question about brightness, I have driven through Sharavathi forest (on my way to Jog falls) in monsoons, at 8pm, in complete darkness, miles away from even the smallest human settlement with this bulb setup.

I am personally against LEDs in low beams because that pretty much ensures that you end up blinding the oncoming traffic, especially in city. You can read the posts between me and krishnakumar discussing this very aspect. This is why I opted for the brightest halogen option for the lower beam rather than picking an LED for it. 3. Bright halogens in the lower can serve most of your driving purposes with ease. I have driven around in pitch black unlit forest areas with these halogens and it works fine. So if it's intensity you're concerned about, you aren't losing by a huge margin. 4. I can't really compare it to other LEDs since I haven't used any others .

You can read the posts between me and krishnakumar discussing this very aspect. This is why I opted for the brightest halogen option for the lower beam rather than picking an LED for it. 3. Bright halogens in the lower can serve most of your driving purposes with ease. I have driven around in pitch black unlit forest areas with these halogens and it works fine. So if it's intensity you're concerned about, you aren't losing by a huge margin. I thought LEDs in the low beam would make sense since it is a projector set up. I totally agree with you, blinding the oncoming traffic could be disastrous. Quote: 4. I can't really compare it to other LEDs since I haven't used any others . I can only comment on my personal experience, which has been great so far. One of my considerstaions while buying these bulbs was also the cost factor. These bulbs were cheaper than most other competitors. Got it, Thanks again.", 20th July 2022,mahindra-xuv300,Bengaluru,31,13,Features/Controls/Displays (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

862, Duckdoc , 19:39 ,BHPian,"30,000 km update of my March 2021 XUV 300 W8 Opt MT This is my update at 30000 kms 16 months post delivery. This part of the post is an answer to questions raised by my colleagues at the time of buying. The first one, from a person with Mahindra vehicles on his farm was that the interiors in Mahindra vehicles age fast. I was also worried about the light interiors. The answer is in the picture below with the rear middle seat 3 point seat belt installed 3 months after purchase: The other was of another colleague who drives a Cysta which was that while he was always impressed with the advertising and image creation of Mahindra, they always failed to deliver. The short answer to that is that they have more than delivered with the XUV 300. This article below gives details of the XUV 300 in South Africa where there are differences: https://www.autotrader.co.za/cars/re...ce-hikes/10484 'The XUV looks compact but the second row is remarkably spacious, and wide enough to seat three adult passengers side-by-side, with sufficient legroom and a three-point safety belt for every passenger who has his/her behind on the supportive leatherette seats. Another nice surprise is the Bridgestone Turanza tyres usually reserved for luxury cars. The central touchscreen, now a little bit bigger, features onboard sat-nav as well as wireless smartphone mirroring, compatible with your Android device and/or an Apple iPhone.' The 3 point seat in the rear middle seat got taken care of in my car. The stock MRF Ecotred tyres were horrible which I replaced with Conti UC6 and now it is grippy and quiet. The NVH is also probably better because of the damping for the audio upgrade. I am happy with the touchscreen, with the size and functionality. While my daily drive is only around 13kms, I like to get out on weekends. Being on the wrong side of 55 and having had multiple surgeries on my left knee I have enjoyed using the clutch which I find good therapy. The ride and handling is superb even with r17 rims. I use 32 psi in the city and 33 for highway driving. This is cold tyre pressure which increases around 2 psi after half an hour of driving. The only sore point is the lack of feedback in the steering and I use the 'Normal' mode for city driving and 'Sport' on the highways which is artificially weighted. The other problem I face is with the blindspot created by the A pillar and the ORVM especially at dusk when a man standing still could be missed and one has to be aware of this. The FE has increased and gives around 17.5-18 kmpl with spirited driving on the highways and around 16.5 kmpl in the city. I have not upgraded the stock headlights which I have found adequate. Overall, I am happy with the car with the ride better than when bought. ", 21st July 2022,mahindra-xuv300,Tamil,108,659,Squeaks/Rattles - Water Leaks - Wind/Road Noise,Very Positive

Because of that, I am always confused whether the air is there or not. You should expect the TPMS to be off by a few points. I don't think you can measure it that accurately and yes, it has to do with calibration. With different tyre temperatures the readings would vary quite a bit. The recommended pressure is for cold tyres, you can check the info plate on the driver side B-pillar. I'd recommend switching to normal air, just because it is more widely accessible and the wheels and tyres are anyway built to run on normal air. It also allows you to buy a tyre inflator and fill it at home where you can get a true cold tyre pressure reading.

921, spr1ngleo , 22:01 ,BHPian,"Dear All, I recently bought a pre-worshipped XUV 300 Diesel W8(O) 2019 Apr model, with just 16.8K on the ODO. This was a leased car registered with M&M themselves and was delighted to get it. Following are pros and cons of this new stead, along with queries I have. Pros: 1. Engine - ""Damn good"", especially between 1500 to 2500 rpm range. Lunges forward like a bullet. 2. Amount of features - steering direction, TPMS, steering comfort, cruise control, sunroof so on and so forth. 3. The car seems very nimble even when it weighs around 1400 kgs. 4. Light controls especially the steering, gear shifts and clutch. I rode Ecosport and Scorpio both in diesel avatar and I can vouch for XUV 300 clutch, really eases driving in town. 5. Suspension is brilliantly tuned, hats off to Mahindra engineers. 6. NVH/refinement is on par with Hyundai. Cons: 1. Lack of dead pedal, and then cramped up footwell makes it hard to accommodate your feet between clutch and center console, especially with those over-sized sandals. 2. Lack of under thigh support in both front and rear seats is a downer. I have been spoilt by Ecosport and Scorpio in this department. 3. Beige (rather white) leatherette seats could be hard to maintain in the long run - fingers crossed. 4. Lack of telescopic steering adjust makes me miss Ecosport dearly. 5. Of course, ubiquitous complaint of the lack of boot space. 6. The bottom/low end pull of the engine is pathetic. Especially pronounced in the second gear where the engine starts to lug in the absence of throttle input. This is in contrast with Ecosport where in-city drivability is superb, what with the second gear acceleration without any throttle input pulls the car effortlessly. I guess xuv 300 has been designed only for mid-range. In view of the aforementioned cons, let me put forth my queries for this august forum to peruse and respond: 1. Engine mapping available to enhance low end torque/drivability? 2. Any chance a dead pedal could be installed ? 3. Have seen under thigh support as an accessory https://www.amazon.in/YQJ-Extender-C...7Y6T2WS3&psc=1 , is it any good?

But Ill tell you that you took the best decision going for a 2019 version. Mahindra has been incessantly deleting and downgrading features, I envy those 2019 BS4 models when I see them on road. Regarding the low end torque, yes it is a problem. In Bangalore, there is a garage called Engineering Exponent who is well known in engine remapping. Comes with mod master Dr.Narens personal recommendation. I spoke to EE and they confirmed that Wolf Moto has a remap available but I havent explored it yet because my car is still new and dont want to void warranty.

923, Bit , 21:06 ,BHPian,"There are rumors of a decently facelifted XUV 300 which promises a better infotainment system and a redesigned front grill soon (in the next 3-4 months). However what makes it dubious is the fact that there has been a launch of the TGDI variant, along with a very minor facelift just recently in 2022 (with just the new twin peak logos and a couple of lines here and there). Common sense says that if they were planning a proper facelift, they wouldn't have introduced this cosmetic change as it makes much better sense to launch it along with the proper generation upgrade. I've been planning for a compact SUV and ""almost"" fixated on XUV300 with the only thing holding me back is the infotainment screen and outdated dashboard (I couldn't care less for the boot space - I can practically live even without a boot : ) and wondering if it would make sense to wait for a few months?

I guess xuv 300 has been designed only for mid-range. The poor low end response is not due to the engine per-se. The engine has enough grunt even when off turbo. The main culprit is poor second gear ratio chosen by Mahindra. The first gear is very short and the second gear is too tall and there is a large gap between the two. So you have to be at a much higher speed to engage the second gear compared to other cars. Same behavior is seen in Marazzo where you have to be at 18-19 kmph before you can shift to the second gear without the engine lugging.", 10th November 2022,mahindra-xuv300,Banaglore,642,"2,095",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

I'm not sure if this is because I come from a petrol car previously, but I never found the low end torque poor. Very often in the city I end up just cruising on idle in 2/3/4th gear. If you are talking about getting the car rolling from a standstill in 2nd gear (I've seen many of my diesel car owner friends do this), then it's not supposed to do that. One might be habituated to it in a previous car, but ideally one is supposed to engage the 1st gear while starting off from a standstill. Sorry if this sounds condescending. I have no intentions of being so. But for slowing down to about ~10-20kmph, I seem to easily roll in 2nd as is. Also I feel that another factor here is that the XUV300 is a good 200kg heavier than the ecosport. Last I checked ecosport was 1200 something. The 300 diesel is 1400 something.

What the thread talks about covers not just starting from a complete standstill, but also using 2nd gear at speeds where ideally the 1st should be engaged. Also I have another addendum for the gentleman here who mentioned they had an EcoSport; the Ecosport diesel as far as I know had a 5 speed gearbox. So each gear will be slightly longer than something on the XUV300, since it has a 6 speed gearbox. In summation, a general word of advice to all my fellow 300 owners, please do not use 2nd gear in bumper to bumper traffic, or to get the car off a standstill. It is not designed to do that, and it will wear the clutch and gearbox faster. Older cars had a 5 speed boxes and hence the gears were wide enough in terms of range to handle such situations, but even then it was not the right thing to do.", 11th November 2022,mahindra-xuv300,Pune,552,789,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

I dont think anyone is talking about starting a car from second year or using second gear to start from standstill. In XUV300, slowing down for a speed bump more often than not necessitates downshifting to 1st gear. Now with experience I can manage to continue in 2nd gear 7/10 times but the other times I have to downshift. Similarly in crawling traffic where the speed keeps varying between lets say 10-25kph, one should ideally be able to lug along in 2nd gear. In our car, it just takes slightly longer for getting the revs up and for the engine to respond, often necessitating a downshift. This is only a mild inconvenience once you know the machine.

930, PetroHeado , 01:45 ,BHPian,"Hello, Fellow BHPians and XUV300 owners, This would be my really short preview to the upcoming ownership update of my XUV300 Petrol MT W8, bought in August of 2021. The boy has covered 10k km on the ODO and has had his 2nd periodic checkup with the doc! All is good and running smoothly. Touchwood! I wish to jot down some things I feel really happy about it. And they are: 1) The car seems much smoother ( Shifts and driveability). 2) Just shines the best on the highway. Especially my mom who is not always happy with most car rear seats seems really satisfied. Yes! We did hit the Chennai-Alleppey trip (1500 od km) twice. 3) Has a really sorted ride and handling. I would say a perfect balance for city and highway alike. That 17-inch Tyre was skeptical at first but, Kudos Mahindra! You did a wonderful job in striking that balance. 4) It's an absolute hoot to drive around corners and open roads. I feel much connected with the car and it handles well, the body roll is well controlled, the chassis is playable (it's a rally car of course!), and a well-groomed (road manners) gentleman when u want it to be. 5) Every feature listed during the purchase works as it was intended to. No complaints. 6) Extremely satisfied with Mahindra's Service. Both in Kerala (1st service) and in Chennai ( for the second service). I definitely feel a huge step up in this regard. And I can safely assume that the lousy reputation around Mahindra's negative past will turn around. 7) Boot is ample for a family of 3. with the added 60:40 spilt (peace of mind) available. (Also we do have a luggage rack that can be mounted to the roof rails) A fact if u didn't know: The roof rails on W8 and W8(O) variants are bolted to the car frame so luggage racks can be safely mounted on them. (verified this with the service team) Actually, Mahindra has it as an accessory in some of their showrooms ( quite pricey tho!) 8) Space, Practicality, and features had always been its plus point and it does its job well (Actually Damn good in that area!) Overall I am a happy customer. This car perfectly satisfies the caring son for my parents when I need to drive around with them and it also caters to the 9-year-old in me when I occasionally take it for a spin in the twisties ( I do drive responsibly and I am in no way a fan of speed or maniacal driving theories to have fun because I am a BHPian!) Some queries to my fellow Petrol XUV300 Owners: 1) My FE is around 8-9 Kmpl in the city and Light-footed drive. On the highways, as observed in Kerala trips 17-19 Kpml (85-100 Km/hr). The city FE seems too low. Though I accepted this wud be the case when I bought it, During my initial days the FE was around 10-11 kmpl in the city. It seemed to have dropped as days passed. I am actually planning to switch to premium petrol and increase tyre pressure by 2 psi to try and see if that helps, or should I? What are your (Bhpians) FE figures noticed in your car? 2) Has anybody noticed this or is it just mine...... My MID > FE display, if I am driving in a spirited manner, Shows 10 Kmpl. Doesn't go lower than that. tank to tank is a different story together. But the issue here is no matter how much I try the FE only shows 10 Kpml. But I do remember in youtube videos people's cars showing lower than the 10 mark. Can the BHPians testify, if their cars show the same as my MID case in contention here? 3) A fun fact or a serious issue ( You guys let me know): I can faintly hear a whining noise when I rev heard in 3rd gear. And it's like a supercharger noise( I am not bluffing) it's too low to record, but I definitely can hear it clearly when I am munching miles on the Highway, and it is audible post-2000 rpm ( in the turbo zone) and it only gets louder and more pronounced as I give it more beans but only in 3rd gear. It's not audible in other gears. Is it the sound of the turbo or is there a mechanical issue with the engine? 4) Any idea as to how to retrofit the new MM Logo? I love the Twin peak logo but I can't find a way to do it, at least here in Chennai. If anybody has done it, do share it with me. Yep! And I am concluding this small update here. I am preparing a detailed report, some pictures and points that need to be added, and a lot of proofreading to do before posting (Excuse: held up with a lot of personal work). But very soon hoping to post it. In the meanwhile do share your thoughts owners and BHPians. Have a Good day.

Downshift to 2nd and see if the car gains momentum comfortably. The original point was whether the car can comfortably pull off 10-20kmph in 2nd gear. It shouldn't matter how you reach that speed. It should only matter if the car can carry those low speeds in 2nd. But anyway I went out and tested the exact test-case you asked for: https://youtube.com/watch?v=vCLw7Os9p_s?feature=share Was driving in 3rd, slowed down to around 15kmph speedo indicated, ~12-13kmph real. Downshifted to 2nd, continued in 2nd. Accelerated a bit, then the next speed-breaker comes up immediately in a few seconds, again braked down to 10kmph speedo indicated, continued in 2nd. I hope this fits your vision of the test. Added bonus: https://youtube.com/watch?v=oy4U8ZDEYwA?feature=share Starting the car from a complete standstill in 2nd gear itself. Level road, no rolling. Directly engaged the 2nd gear, and started off on engine idle alone. No throttle input whatsoever. Obviously had to half-clutch for the first couple of seconds, but after that it took off comfortably. I hope nobody is reasonably expecting it to start pulling in 2nd without any half-clutch. I never do this in my normal driving, but decided to give it a try. It works. I can see this car comfortably do as low as 25-30kmph in 3rd gear itself. I use that amazing low-end torque every day in my city driving.

The initial post covers this part extensively. https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/buyin...heck-list.html (ARTICLE: Pre-delivery Inspection (PDI) & Check List) 2) For the Insurance too we have an excellent FAQ thread that you can refer which extensively covers most points. TeamBHP is a blessing! Attaching the same for your reference. https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/india...rance-faq.html (Automobile Insurance - FAQ) 3) Regarding RSA: My 2 cents:- Having RSA, especially from the manufacturer (via a dealership) is a necessity in my opinion. Since you are coughing up money to go for the top variant of the XUV300 you might as well get an RSA. Reasons:- * Vehicle is stuck or not in a driveable condition ( I wish this never happens to any driver) the manufacturer will send a mobile repair unit. They would try to get fixed if not they tow it to the nearest service center. * If the vehicle needs extreme repair they may even offer you a temporary vehicle to complete your planned trip. One of the BHPians had mentioned he got a Thar as a temporary vehicle when his car broke down in the middle of the trip. * Heck even if you run out of Fuel the RSA team will come to your rescue. * And all this you need not pay. It's covered in the RSA package. For repairs however you must pay depending on your warranty. But definitely have a discussion with your Sales advisor on what the RSA covers. * And in the end, why not? RSA offers peace of mind when you go on any trips Pan India. It's always good to have it just in case things wished to go south! 4) As far as negotiations my biggest trump card here would be the fact that year-end is arriving and hence there is depreciation that can affect the value of the car so I will definitely pursue them to slash some prices. The carwale and related discounts are not true in all directions. Maybe you can quote them, but never mind! You can just directly talk with the sales advisor and ask for a better deal. Places you can negotiate for a discount:- * Car price:- Since year-end is around the corner expect some slashing on the prices. * Accessories:- You can request some free accessories like floor mats, sun film on windows, underbody coating, mudflaps, etc. Basically, as much as they are willing to give you! * Insurance:- Match with the insurance value that you quoted from an external agent. * Any other benefits if mentioned in the Mahindra website associated with XUV300. In the end, it's all about the dialogue between you and the dealer. My advice, get quotes and offers from multiple dealers for the same car. And go for the dealership that offers the best price, comprehensive deal as I mentioned above, polite behavior and has a good track record ( maybe Gmaps review may help there).

942, JKBKS , 17:55 ,BHPian,"Dear All, I am thinking of buying XUV 300 W6 Petrol Autoshift and have gone through most of the pages here to gather as much info as possible. Running wont be more than a 1000 kms and i intend to keep it for 8-10 years. Taken a test drive as well and now know how an AMT drives. Though not too happy but this is what the segment offers I guess (have discarded Maruti, Hyundai, Magnite and Kiger). Am yet to drive Nexon Petrol AMT but think it should not be too different since both (XUV & Nexon) have Marelli sourced AMT units. I did drive Altroz DCA and wished Nexon had it too. Would have been a no brainer then!! I own a Scorpio for many years and am comfortable with Mahindra reliability. I need an expert advice on following aspects: a) Service Interval (if its 1 year or 6 month) b) Improving headlights (although saw some posts but they were for W8 variant that has Projectors, i believe) c) Should i wait for Facelift (I can wait if TC comes in otherwise will buy AMT now itself) d) Should I buy Nexon Petrol AMT instead (if many feel that current Nexon Petrol AMT is a better product) Thanks in advance, Regards", 20th November 2022,mahindra-xuv300,Bangalore,274,184,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

944, PetroHeado , 23:41 ,BHPian,"Hey Mate! Great that you are into buying a new car! To answer your question, here goes my 2 cents:- 1) It's 1 year. After purchase, there is the first service at 1000km post which every subsequent service comes at 10000km or 1-year w.e.e. 2) Headlights as stock are quite good. However, since it's the W6, I guess slamming an LED that matches the wattage or power requirements shouldn't be an issue as there are lesser complications, unlike a projector setup. 3) Ah the facelift!!!! Uncertain. Period. However, the recent version in the market is still a good buy. We can predict the facelift to arrive by early next year. If your purchase decision can be pushed till then I would suggest so albeit with a risk of an increase in price, deletion of feature, or may still come with an AMT. And yes as @ashishk29 said waiting periods are a pain. 4) Please avoid Nexon AMT. The laggy engine, an AMT not so well tuned, jerky power delivery, TATA's service is a bigger gamble than MM's, and the lesser space and driving dynamics do not justify this car over the XUV. The XUV outshines every other area except for the not-so-impressive boot space. But I do admit the Nexon is priced lower than the XUV but it's a choice u have to make. If you have an enthusiast inside XUV is simply the way to go. If your willing to live with some niggles but keen on price point Nexon it is. Hopeful this adds to the previous BHPians suggestion.

Boot space/Pricing are not a big factor. As I am looking to keep the car for next 7-8 years the mechanicals should be sound and that's where the engine, AMT integration and all 4 discs come in play.

Stock H4 bulbs across the industry are rated at 60/55W for passenger vehicles. 100/90W is rated at higher wattage than 60/55W, it will put slightly more load on the stock wiring, hence the suggestion to use a relay harness which will divert the load away from stock harness. The battery and all other electricals can very well handle much higher loads than this. But please don't skimp on the relay harness. Yes, using 100/90W will generate extra heat but nothing that the reflectors / plastics cannot handle. If you're still sceptical, you can avoid using it on high beams continuously for long durations or switch off the headlights at traffic signals. The only plastic point of contact is the connector in the stock harness, which is why it is better to use the relay harness with ceramic connectors. I have even used 130/100W bulbs on my TUV and Alto and had no issue despite continuous usage. For any halogen based reflector, this is the best upgrade as the beam pattern remains the same but the light output increases. Although if you ask me, Mahindra has done an awful job with their reflector design on all XUV300 variants as the high beam is more of a euro beam than a spot beam. The low beams are pretty good though on all variants. After multiple experiments with my W8 headlights, I finally stuck to HID for low-beam projectors which suffice within the city, and added auxiliary lights for long highway drives. I've completely given up on the high-beam reflectors of W8/W8O.", 22nd November 2022,mahindra-xuv300,Kolkata/Gurgaon,125,210,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

My worst fear became true, the service advisor confirmed that it appears to be a clutch burn (He advised the replacement would cost 18k). Really? 20 days, 900 Km. What was worse was the advice from the service advisor, do not drive on half clutch. I have no idea on how to move the vehicle in Bangalore in that case. I am not saying I am a perfect driver, but I drove a Polo for almost 10 years and never ever had issues with the clutch before. I will be taking the vehicle to Anant Cars service next week for further checks. I see some posts on google around this but wonder if anyone here has seen this problem and on what can be done here.", 13th January 2023,mahindra-xuv300,Bangalore,6,4,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

Update - I did take the vehicle to Anant Cars and they repeated that the burn smell was due to driving on half clutch with probably the break as well in between. While this may have happened during one stretch that day, I cannot believe that it could happen so soon. Apart from the smell, I have no other issues with gear change or clutch response. Anyways, they said they would take a look during the service and they came back saying that there were no mechanical/electrical problems. And interestingly after the service, the smell has gone away. Not sure what hack they did for this but I am not entirely convinced that this is permanent.

Well, I can also add an incident that happened to me. I too did experience some burning smell when the vehicle was fresh. And I could easily understand it was a clutch burn. I took it to a service and they confirmed the same. And they checked the internals and said all is good as of now and gave me some driving tips. A) Drive with a light right foot. [Good FE + Peace of mind] B) Don't keep the clutch engaged when in traffic. I always put it in neutral and keep my left foot on the floor. If your using an automatic don't leave it in drive rather put it in neutral. C) Somehow due to my tamed driving manners I have learned to keep my left foot off the clutch pedal when I drive, more than traditional drivers whose clutch also works as a resting place for the foot. Following these, never have I ever experienced a clutch burn since then. Just wanted to share these, if this may help you. Have a good day and congrats for the new ride.

974, deepCarLover , 15:20 ,Newbie,"My XUV300 buying experience Before I share my experience here, first a big shout-out to this forum, it's creators and members. For without them, it would be difficult making choices and gathering information related to these mean machines. A big thank you to all the contributors. So, the search for a new car started as offices have started opening gradually and day to day commute was getting difficult with increased unpredictability of cab aggregators (read multiple cancellations, longer waiting time etc.) Thus, the decision to buy our own car. Our search criteria: 1. A sub-4 m SUV (since we already have hatchbacks and sedans in the family and have driven them enough). 2. Budget of max 15 Lakhs. 3. Automatic, since majority of our driving is going to be in the city, and Pune being one city where we can sometime find speed breakers at an interval of every 100 meters. (Not kidding here. It's true for many parts of the city, though not everywhere.) 4. Petrol car (since we dont yet know how much we are going to run as its our first car in the city). It would be used mostly for office commute and occasional out station trips. The cars under consideration were Maruti Brezza, Hyundai Venue, Tata Nexon, Kia Sonet and Mahindra XUV300. I will share my opinion about each one of them based solely on my test drive(s). Brezza AT: No of test drives taken: 4 Likes: i. Very refined and reliable 1.5L NA Petrol engineii. Good mileage, all thanks to the smart hybrid systemiii. Feature rich car (ZXi & ZXi+ variants)iv. Comfortable seats & Good cabin spaceDidnt like much: i. I felt it struggled in the mid-range. The power delivery was not immediate due to NA engine.ii. Suspension not smooth enough in the bumpy roads.iii. Long waiting period up to 5-6 months for AT transmission (Though the sales executive said it could be delivered in 3-4 months, still too much for me). Hence this was a deal breaker.Venue DCT:No of test drives taken: 3 Likes: i. Really loved the 1.0 L Turbo engineii. Quick power deliveryiii. Ample features with most options (all possible combinations of iMT, DCT, Petrol, Diesel)iv. Smooth gear shifts due to DCTDidnt like much: i. Seats were not comfortable enough for me.ii. Cabin is not very spacious compared to the competitors.iii. Not enough room in the rear seat for 3 people.iv. Poor ride quality as the suspension didnt absorb the undulations on the road well. This was the deal breaker here.I didnt test drive Sonet considering it similar to Venue based on multiple reviews & discussions on different forum.Nexon:No of test drives taken: 0 My cousin owns this car, and I dont really like the stance of the car. I feel it looks more like a raised hatch back. Also, headroom in the rear seat appears to be less. The AMT transmission and engine refinement is not up to the mark. The showroom visit experience was poor as the sales people appeared least interested in attending to the customers. Upon arrival, we were asked to wait for 30 mins till a sales advisor could see us. We could see many sales people roaming around here and there and just chatting with each other but no one came to attend to a waiting customer. Probably a typical show of Tatas sales team. We ultimately walked out of the showroom expecting a call back since we had filled the enquiry form but that never happened. However, I have heard from a lot of people that it is the most value for money car in this segment. XUV300 AMT:No of test drives taken: 5 Likes: i. 1.2 L Turbo engine with best in segment torqueii. Best in segment wheelbase which leads to comfortable seating space in second rowiii. Best in segment safetyiv. Most comfortable ride quality with sufficient featuresv. Proper SUV like stance.Didnt like much: i. Lowest in segment boot space. Manageable for me. ii. AMT features in 2nd base and top trim only. Its not available in 2nd top trim.iii. Limited color options to choose from (just 3 in AMT)iv. Excessive omission of features despite the price rise in lower variants.After all the test drives, we were tied between Brezza and XUV300. However, the ride quality, performance and safety trumped over mileage and reliability, and we zeroed down on XUV300. I know AMT is a compromise here since the lower gear shifts are not very smooth and it appears confused sometimes. I hope we can get used to it with time. Cutting down of features in W6 (2nd base) variant was a huge disappointment. Some important features such as adjustable head rest for rear passengers, rear spoiler, 60:40 split rear seats and touchscreen infotainment system have been removed. Absence of height adjustable drivers seat is a major miss. So, we had no choice but to opt for W8 (O) variant which is on the higher side of the price spectrum. And even this variant hasnt been spared the feature omissions: 3-point seat belt for 2nd row middle passenger, request sensor on passenger side front door, ajar lamp on door etc. have been removed. Dont really know what Mahindra was thinking while removing them. But I fell for its ride quality and comfort. No other car comes close to it in the segment. So, from this car hunting experience what I have learnt is that no car is perfect. None. We just need to find the right compromise based on what we are looking for. XUV300 ticket majority of our checkboxes and we booked the W8(O) Petrol AMT on 10 January, 2023 and awaiting the delivery. The sales team said the official waiting period in Pune is 7 weeks, but they would try to deliver it as soon as they can. I hope my experience would help someone the way someone elses helped me.

I guess Mahindra had to suffer some loss to release this car at that price point. I don't really know what's the picture at their Pricing team. Coming to Nexon, yes it is a VFM package. But somehow all the people I come across, who own a TATA vehicle have had bad sales or after-sales experiences. They have sorted their products but forgot about quality control. In the previous days, even Mahindra was in this region. But since the past year, the service experience has been really smooth for me. Mahindra is definitely no more the old butch SUV manufacturer. They indeed care about their customers. And there are loads of reviews in our forum to prove the same. I guess you made the right decision. Yes, maybe you could have saved a bit on the pricing, but a car that is closest to your heart will definitely give you more joy as the ride goes on. Once again a hearty congratulations to you.

978, Spirited_Bibhu , 11:33 ,Newbie,"After having driven the Wagon R (VXi 2014) for around 9 years, I convinced myself that I had earned a second car. For almost a year's time, I have been browsing through innumerable auto magazines, websites, blogs etc. My screen time on YouTube increased drastically; most of which is due to binge watching car reviews. What made to think of a second car? Although a near perfect vehicle for meeting most of my daily needs, the Wagon R was a kind of compromise since a couple of years after buying the car. It is brutally practical, cost effective (I get >20 kmpl), spacious, budget friendly. However, it is not aspirational. On highways, I have to literally bury my wish to overtake. Even standing on the throttle doesn’t make any difference. Worse is the lack of confidence in braking. So the first thing I wanted in my second car was power and drivability. Other features like safety, ground clearance etc. followed in the list. The search (starting with VW Taigun/ Skoda Kushaq) From a very long time I have been fascinated by the design philosophy of Volkswagen. I remember how I always liked the Vento. Too many cuts and lines are deterrents to the overall design. The first vehicle to be test driven in the season was the VW Taigun. Extremely drivable car with highest safety rating. I drove both 1L TSI and 1.5L TSI. The 1.5L TSI with DSG is a king on the road. However, it’s too pricy. The 1L TSI was within our budget and we almost booked the car. There is only one showroom of VW in the entire North East - at Guwahati. The sales team is aggressive and were happy to help any time with any query. They even arranged for a test drive at Dibrugarh (450 km away from Guwahati!). Couple of things held up our decision with VW: 1) Poor service network, 2) Issues with AC cooling in 1L TSI. One more thing I can’t do with is however may be the performance, a 1L engine is a 1L engine. Even if it throws out 114 bhp, I have some doubts about the performance of the engine in the long run. I have watched videos where people weren’t liking it on the hills. I feel the same for Skoda Kushaq, which has a showroom in Dibrugarh. Maruti Sisters (New Brezza and Grand Vitara) Maruti is like a homecoming. Visiting the Maruti showroom made me comfortable as I knew the DNA of their service quality. Having driven Brezza several times in the past (as many of my colleagues have it), I had no intentions to take a test drive. I observed that the sunroof was an addition! As for Grand Vitara, I observed it is an unevenly long car and heavily underpowered. I don’t see why people should pay heavily for the Grand Vitara for the same engine. It feels helpless to know that Brezza, Ciaz, Ertiga, XL6, Grand Vitara…all run with the same engine with some variations and that too with such low safety rating. Needless to mention that hybrid was not on my ""look for"" list. Hyundai Creta/ Venue I must admit that Hyundai is one of the best when it comes to design and plastic engineering. The looks of both, Creta and Venue are stunning. I test drove a Creta 1.5L and found the performance linear and stable. The steering feedback is awesome and the drivability is exciting. The boot space in the Creta is adequate and the cabin looks clean and elegant. Hyundai has an excellent service network and eager to help staff (which comes from their Korean lineage). However, the downsides are unconfirmed safety ratings and low mileage. The car is a little overpriced considering it has been on the market for quite some time. Coming to the Venue, the rear seat is a huge letdown. It can barely accommodate two adults. Kia Seltos/ Sonnet Have you watched the videos on YouTube where the car breaks in two halves? For Kia, I must say, excellent design and aspirational. But I couldn’t convince myself to spend lakhs on a Car which is an excellent piece of plastic! Tata Nexon Now, this is one car which meets most of the abilities you look for in a car. Excellent drivability, good road presence, high safety ratings etc. A year back, one of my colleagues bought a Nexon 1.2L Turbo Petrol. Since then, I ran many errands using the Nexon. One thing I disliked was the engine noise...even at noticeable levels inside the cabin. Understand it is a 3-cylinder machine, however, some level of refinement is expected as after all, it’s a private car. Nonetheless, I kind of liked the car. But my wife feels that the rear seats give her a claustrophobic feeling due to the smaller windows in the rear. I kind of clung to the car for a long time - almost made up my mind. But due to long-term nudging by my wife, I found that yes, the car is over-designed. XUV 300 TGDi Honestly, Mahindra was never on my list. I carried a feeling that M&M cars are all diesel cars used by contractors and politicians (). Me and my wife once just dropped into an M&M Showroom to check out the new Scorpio N. We learnt that the waiting time for the Scorpio N is one year! While we were about to leave the showroom, this new white XUV 300 TDGi caught our attention. It looked stunning in the showroom. The red treatment on the grill area draws immediate attention. Then the engine performance blew my mind - 128 bhp of power and 230 Nm of torque pushed out of an mStallon engine! I wondered if its an underrated car as I had never come across a proper advertisement for the car. The likes of Venue and Grand Vitara have got so much more screen time. At once I was convinced of the excellent performance this car would offer. However, convincing my wife for the car solely on engine performance was difficult. So I took her to the showroom again. She liked the simplicity of the design. The car has road presence….from the front it looks massive, the shoulder lines are bold, but then, it's suddenly compromised at the rear (they have to). I liked the tail-lamps. From the internet, I got to know XUV300 is an avatar of the successful Tivoli of SsangYong. I liked the rear stance of the car. I made two subsequent visits to the showroom and then took a test drive. Once I took charge of the car, from the driving position, all inhibitions were dusted away. Such power delivery from a 1.2L engine, excellently silent cabin, awesome drivability and turning radius. There was no turning back since. We booked the car and in a week’s time, it was delivered. We opted for the white coloured top variant - W8(O). The sales guy pitched for chassis and underbody painting and I agreed. Purchased only a couple of accessories like mud flaps, window shades, rear parcel tray (surprisingly doesn’t come with this car!) and 3D floor mats. My way of comparison Although I made my mind to go with XUV300 TDGi, I ran the numbers and worked out a comparison (copy of Excel document attached). Review After driving the car for a month now, the following are the listed upsides and downsides: Upsides: 1. Performance (best in class by far) 2. Decent Mileage of 16-18 kmpl 3. Driving Comfort 4. 5 Star Safety / 6 Airbags 5. Too good Cabin Noise Insulation 6. Comfortable rear seat for 3 adults 7. All wheels disk brakes 8. Other features like ESP, Hill Hold etc. 9. Better quality plastics used interior 10. Good cabin design 11. Wide Sunroof Downsides: 1. Boot Space (smaller than my existing Wagon R) 2. Dated Infotainment system (but works well without any lag) Driving and ownership review I was fortunate to take the car out on New Year's Day (01.01.2023). We were three adults in the car. The best part of the engine is that the turbo comes to life almost immediately. From my experience, I found revving at around 1.6k rpm will unleash the beast. The mid range is just awesome. Driving between third and fourth gears gives a supreme experience. I found the second gear a little uncomfortable. Summarily, the engine is best suited for mid range performance and this where most of the driving would be. I found the shifting between second and third gears a little clunky and hesitant. There is no dearth of power and torque in the car. The suspension of the car is good but not as good as VW / Skoda cars in a similar budget. There is some amount of body roll in the curves. The car gives a good view from the driver's seat and is easy to manoeuvre. Although three steering modes are given, I find the steering feedback just average. The infotainment looks dated. Mahindra could have easily worked on it in line with the one provided in Scorpio-N. However, performance lovers would hardly care for such soft features. The Apple CarPlay works fine with no lag. The BlueSense app has limited functionality and works only when inside the car (which is weird). I am looking to go for a long drive very soon and hopefully, will come up with a detailed blog.", 1st February 2023,mahindra-xuv300,Dibrugarh,4,22,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

You went through the same stuff I did on my purchase. In my case, it was my mom who immediately found the Nexon's cabin claustrophobic. And she was immediately sold when she sat inside the Beige cabin of the XUV300. Somehow we must all agree that when it comes to cars, home interiors, or designer and lifestyle stuff, it's better if our women army at home makes the decision. The peace of mind is simply worth it. The way u eliminated each car was the exact same ordeal I went through last year when I was in this same saga. Though the Taigun was not present the Kushaq was just launched back then. Looking back now I definitely feel it was the best decision to go for the XUV. From the 4 trips we had to and fro between Alleppey And Chennai (a distance of 800 odd KMs, the excellent ride quality, and the sweet engine, it's a bliss to live with. And the reliability is top-notch. As far as the boot space goes, you can any day buy a Luggage rake from the Official Mahindra website, it is reliable and worth it. The roof carriers that come with the car are bolted to the car frame so they can carry a load of luggage rake with heavy stuff on them, I tested them on our Kerala trip and faced no issues as such. But as such for most occasions the boot space is more than adequate and the 60:40 split again adds to the practicality. And regarding your statement about suspension, we can agree to disagree here, I feel this car has one of the most balanced and sorted suspensions in the CSUV segment, it would be cruel to compare it with a Sedan, which always has the advantage of softer springs and more compliant driving dynamics. At the time of my purchase, many said Mahindras are best for Diesel and tractors, but once they saw and rode in our cars they immediately changed their minds. I feel proud about the Journey Mahindra has come down the line. Hearty congratulations on your new ride. I wish you and your family, a million happy miles and more.

Undecided between petrol or diesel, variant (w6 or w8(0)) and color. Finding a XUV300 AMT test drive in Hyderabad by itself was very difficult and finally after 2 weeks of continuous follow-up with several dealerships finally got hold of a Diesel AMT. Loved the silent cabin, had to check if it actually was a diesel as it was that good. There definitely is a head-nod with AMT, but decided to live with it, as every vehicle I test drove had some compromise to make. Found XUV300 to be the least in terms of compromises I have to make and is budget friendly as well. I currently own a 8+ years old XUV500 but planning to retain it for long/outstation drives, so this XUV300 would be pretty much limited to city and few outstation drives if required. Since I could not get hold of a petrol AMT, not sure how good petrol AMT would be when compared to diesel AMT. I found the head-nod, acceleration in city all good with Diesel AMT, can I expect the same with petrol AMT?. On highways, I am pretty sure Diesel would fare better but my usage would be limited on highways. So for city would I see any difference between petrol and Diesel AMTs?. If petrol AMT is as good as Diesel AMT for my usage, I can save a further 1.5L and hence the question. On the variant, W6 to W8(0) difference is almost 3L on road (both petrol and diesel) and for my requirement, W6 pretty much meets all the requirements. However I have the following questions just to make an informed decision: On W6 AMT (petrol or diesel) are the following available: 1) Arm rest 2) Are Roof rails functional? (I can attach roof rack if required to carry additional luggage) I am planning to buy W6 AMT and go with the following accessories: 1) Arm rest (if vehicle does not come with it already) 2) fog lamps 3) black leather seats 4) black leather steering cover 5) front parking sensors 6) roof rack 7) Android touch screen music system 8) reverse camera 9) Alloys All of these from Mahindra showroom itself as it would not void my warranty. Any thing else required? Any inputs to help me decide on the fuel type, variant and accessories would help me a lot. I will create a separate thread on why I decided on XUV300 post purchase.

Thanks in advance for your help. I bought an XUV 300 Petrol AMT recently. An automatic very safe small car (under 4mts) was my requirement and accordingly Kushaq/Nexon/XUV300 were my picks. Didn't consider Brezza as its 4star. Since monthly running wont cross 600-700 kms so Petrol was the natural choice. Was told by industry guys that one should only opt for Diesel if minimum running was 1500kms a month and that XUV300 had a better AMT/engine integration than Nexon. I found Kushaq to be rather small and unimpressive when compared to Nexon and XUV300 so it was out. XUV300 gave the feeling of an airy bigger car, given its higher wheelbase than Nexon. It also has all 4 disc brakes in addition to have better safety scores than Nexon within 5 star ratings. Only advantage with W8 (O) is its 7 air bags and DRLs to some extent but one of my kids is using it so 7 air bags seemed overkill to me. So bought on XUV 300 W6 Petrol AMT as i found it to be a better value. I got DRLs, W8 Projectors Headlights, Fog lamps, W8 brake lights, W8 Arm Rest, door hazard lamps (all Mahindra Genuine) installed aftermarket in addition to an Android/reverse camera/seats covers/steering cover/ spoiler/ABS front & rear guard and few other accessories as i thought they added value.

I dont think there's going to be much difference between Petrol/Diesel AMT handling especially when its going to be used in city mostly. But if your monthly running is over 2000 kms then it may make sense. But BS6 diesel has DPF related issues that need to be kept in mind too. Also big metros may ban Diesels down the line which could be an issue if you intend to keep it for 7-10 years. Petrol gives a 15 year ownership window at the very least.

If petrol AMT is as good as Diesel AMT for my usage, I can save a further 1.5L and hence the question. Any inputs to help me decide on the fuel type, variant and accessories would help me a lot. Hey Mate, Congrats on choosing your new ride. As a person who has driven both the Diesel and the petrol model, I will list down why I went with the petrol XUV. * Petrol, since my monthly ride is less than 600-700 Km. Because excessive periods of the car sitting idle at the garage may cause DPF-related problems. Although it has an easy fix, I didn't want the added trouble or rather I felt it was unnecessary. * Since there was a huge price difference between petrol and Diesel, at least with respect to my budget back then. Some points to note: * I loved the Diesel, it was smooth, I and my buddies who went to a test drive were so amazed to even imagine it was a Diesel. It was silent, smooth, and had no clattering noise of the Diesel. * The Power figures are definitely better in the Diesel. Even though it is not much felt in manual petrol vs Diesel, AMT variants did show the head nod effect, it was pronounced (negligible) in petrol in comparison with Diesel. This is what I felt. But if I were you I would still pick the petrol, it's completely liveable. * If your monthly ride is on the higher side, the Diesel makes so much sense because it offers excellent mileage. My petrol XUV averages around 12-13 KPML in the city and around 17 at 100 KMPH and 21 ish at 80-85 KMPH. And I am damn sure the diesel offers way more attractive mileage figures. For me, it wasn't a deal breaker as my drives are significantly less except for the vacation trips. So If you want to choose between the 2 fuel types, it's better if you could try and calculate your monthly average usage. If you drive a lot city or highways doesn't matter, 600 Km + I would strongly suggest going for Diesel. As for the variants and accessories related I bought the W8 variant. I didn't go for the W8(O) because I felt it wasn't necessary to have 7 airbags etc, but I still regret that decision. Safety and getting a complete car where I had to do nothing extra from aftermarket (like fog lamps, DRLs, or any significant electrical work) was my priority. So W8 ticked all the boxes for me. But I still opted for some accessories like: * Scuff plates * vacuum cleaner * Window shades (official MM ones) * Chrome bits in handles etc * Underbody coating. Necessary to get done once in 3 years (it was free though as a goodwill gesture) * Mahindra official tire inflator * My variant came as stock with alloys (although the machined ones look really cool) so I didn't go for one * Floor mats * rubber pads for the door pockets and cup holder. ( I hate things sliding around when driving, very important). * parcel shelf * Beige leather seats (official ones) * Front parking sensors * And some extra cosmetic stuff for the car. As for the Armrest, mine had one. But I am not sure Mahindra is allowing one to fit aftermarket officially. You can get it fixed outside though. All my accessories are from Mahindra, they came with one year warranty. The roof rails (if your car by stock or out of the factory has one, not the ones you fit via accessories) are bolted to the frame so they can carry the load on it. I can vouch for this because my brother works at M&M in a reputable position. And I also carried luggage on it during my Chennai to Alleppey trip (around 1600 Kms to and fro) Something additional, I do feel you must take a test ride of even the petrol and see if it's a deal breaker. Wish you all the luck in your purchasing journey. Do keep us posted. And definitely eager for your thread!

Thank you for taking the time for the detailed reply. Very true, the diesel was so damn refined that post the test drive, I actually had to check the fuel lid to confirm if it actually was diesel. After my initial post on this thread, I did take a petrol test drive, it was manual though. I actually found it better than diesel in terms of eagerness to pull and felt light and agile as well. On the contrary, the diesel AMT felt bit heavy and less eager to pull and tiny bit lethargic. Both test drives were under heavy city traffic conditions. Here comes the confusion though, since it was petrol manual vs. diesel AMT, now if petrol AMT is as eager to pull as its manual counterpart, I am worried it might lead to lot of jerkiness as it might have to constantly keep shifting to upper/lower gears under heavy traffic conditions, which would be 80% of its usge. Diesel AMT I found liveable, but if petrol AMT is more pronounced as you say, which I can relate to after driving the manual, not sure how bad it might be. Thank you for confirming the roof rails part of it, so with minimal additional cost, extra luggage space can be managed, so boot space is not a blocker here. Still confused between petrol AMT vs. Diesel AMT. I will try to push for petrol AMT test drive from the dealer before confirming. Mostly it would be W6 variant as I am convinced that it meets all my requirements and I will go with list of additional accessories which would cost me less than half of what I would have to otherwise spend for W8(0).

1006, deepCarLover , 17:57 ,Newbie,"Before I share my experience here, first a big shout-out to this forum, it's creators and members. For without them, it would be difficult making choices and gathering information related to these mean machines. A big thank you to all the contributors. So, the search for a new car started as offices have started opening gradually and day to day commute was getting difficult with increased unpredictability of cab aggregators (read multiple cancellations, longer waiting time etc.) Thus, the decision to buy our own car. Our search criteria: A sub-4 m SUV (since we already have hatchbacks and sedans in the family and have driven them enough). Budget of max 15 Lakhs. Automatic, since majority of our driving is going to be in the city, and Pune being one city where we can sometime find speed breakers at an interval of every 100 meters. (Not kidding here. It's true for many parts of the city, though not everywhere.) Petrol car (since we dont yet know how much we are going to run as its our first car in the city). It would be used mostly for office commute and occasional out station trips. The cars under consideration were Maruti Brezza, Hyundai Venue, Tata Nexon, Kia Sonet and Mahindra XUV300. I will share my opinion about each one of them based solely on my test drive(s). Brezza AT:No of test drives taken: 4 Likes: i. Very refined and reliable 1.5L NA Petrol engine ii. Good mileage, all thanks to the smart hybrid system iii. Feature rich car (ZXi & ZXi+ variants) iv. Comfortable seats & Good cabin spaceDidnt like much: i. I felt it struggled in the mid-range. The power delivery was not immediate due to NA engine. ii. Suspension not smooth enough in the bumpy roads. iii. Long waiting period up to 5-6 months for AT transmission (Though the sales executive said it could be delivered in 3-4 months, still too much for me). Hence this was a deal breaker.Venue DCT:No of test drives taken: 3 Likes: i. Really loved the 1.0 L Turbo engine ii. Quick power delivery iii. Ample features with most options (all possible combinations of iMT, DCT, Petrol, Diesel) iv. Smooth gear shifts due to DCTDidnt like much: i. Seats were not comfortable enough for me. ii. Cabin is not very spacious compared to the competitors. iii. Not enough room in the rear seat for 3 people. iv. Poor ride quality as the suspension didnt absorb the undulations on the road well. This was the deal breaker here.I didnt test drive Sonet considering it similar to Venue based on multiple reviews & discussions on different forum. Nexon:No of test drives taken: 0 My cousin owns this car, and I dont really like the stance of it. I feel it looks more like a raised hatch back. Also, headroom in the rear seat appears to be less. The AMT transmission and engine refinement is not up to the mark. The showroom visit experience was poor as the sales people appeared least interested in attending to the customers. Upon arrival, we were asked to wait for 30 minutes till a sales advisor could see us. We could see many sales people roaming around here and there and just chatting with each other but no one came to attend to a waiting customer. Probably a typical show of Tatas sales team. We ultimately walked out of the showroom expecting a call back since we had filled the enquiry form but that never happened. However, I have heard from a lot of people that it is the most value for money car in this segment.XUV300 AMT:No of test drives taken: 5 Likes: i. 1.2 L Turbo engine with best in segment torque ii. Best in segment wheelbase which leads to comfortable seating space in second row iii. Best in segment safety iv. Most comfortable ride quality with sufficient features v. Proper SUV like stance.Didnt like much: i. Lowest in segment boot space. Manageable for me. ii. AMT features in 2nd base and top trim only. Its not available in 2nd top trim. iii. Limited color options to choose from (just 3 in AMT) iv. Excessive omission of features despite the price rise in lower variants.After all the test drives, we were tied between Brezza and XUV300. However, the ride quality, performance and safety trumped over mileage and reliability, and we zeroed down on XUV300. I know AMT is a compromise here since the lower gear shifts are not very smooth and it appears confused sometimes. I hope we can get used to it with time. Cutting down of features in W6 (2nd base) variant was a huge disappointment. Some important features such as adjustable head rest for rear passengers, rear spoiler, 60:40 split rear seats and touchscreen infotainment system have been removed. Absence of height adjustable drivers seat is a major miss. So, we had no choice but to opt for W8 (O) variant which is on the higher side of the price spectrum. And even this variant hasnt been spared the feature omissions: 3-point seat belt for 2nd row middle passenger, request sensor on passenger side front door, ajar lamp on door etc. have been removed. Dont really know what Mahindra was thinking while removing them. But I fell for its ride quality and comfort. No other car comes close to it in the segment. So, from this car hunting experience what I have learnt is that no car is perfect. None. We just need to find the right compromise based on what we are looking for. XUV300 ticked majority of our checkboxes and we booked the W8(O) Petrol AMT on 10 January, 2023 and awaiting the delivery. The sales team said the official waiting period in Pune is 7 weeks, but they would try to deliver it as soon as they can. I had also made two bookings just to ensure that I get the car as early as possible. Delivery update Received a call from the SA on 22nd January, 2023 that the vehicle would arrive in the stockyard within 2-3 days so we should keep the payment ready. I told her that I would make the payment only after I conduct the PDI and she agreed to it. Next I got a call on 25th January, 2023 that the vehicle had arrived and I could come for PDI. I reached there with the PDI checklist that I had downloaded from team-bhp and made sure to cover as many points as possible. The SA kept waiting patiently as long as I did the inspection. I checked the VIN to ensure it was freshly manufactured and all the features were working as expected. Though I wanted to test drive the car, but couldn't do so since the SA said we couldn't take the car out of the stockyard. But I was satisfied with whatever inspection I could do. Grin on my face after completing the PDI. I made the payment then and there and asked the SA to get the vehicle delivered ASAP. Amount paid to the showroom:Ex-showroom Price: 13,06,001 TCS @1%: 13,060 RTO: 27,000 (approx. for BH-series) Total: 13,46,061 Dealership discount: 25,000 Final payment made: 13,21,061FASTag The dealership quoted INR 600 for it. However, I checked online with a few banks and found the price to be lower. However, I got it from IDFC First Bank for just INR 99 with 99 balance in the FASTag. So technically I got it for free. I ordered it immediately from their website and got it delivered to my address in 4-5 days. I know it's a small amount, but the point is why should we pay even an extra penny to the dealer. Insurance I had purchased insurance online from Acko. The price difference was huge between what was quoted by the showroom and what I got from Acko. I took a RTI, Zero_dep coverage with couple of more add-ons for INR 25,307. The showroom quoted close to INR 52,000 and said after some discounts they could bring it down to max INR 46,000 which was still good 20,000 more than Acko's. For the record, we have been using Acko for insuring another car in the family for close to 5 years now and haven't faced any issues related to claims etc.RTOThis process took the most time. My documents were not in place so the registration was delayed. First, I wanted a BH series registration for which I had taken the required documents from my office (Form-60 with office address in more than 4 states), but the dealer's RTO team said some information was missing in the letter and I had to re-do it. Second, even though I had local address on Aadhar, that wasn't sufficient. The RTO team wanted some more documents such as electricity bill and Index-2. Since these documents were not in my name I had to get a registered rent agreement. Third, the process for BH-series registration is still manual in Maharashtra. After filling up all the forms online, the dealership sends all the documents in-person to the RTO and it has to be approved by the RTO inspector. Only then the registration number is generated. All this process took a good 15 days and on 9th February, 2023 I received the message from Vaahan portal with my registration number. I was elated to see that message and immediately called the SA to make arrangements for the delivery. Final Delivery Having read so many posts to get the delivery in bright day-light, I asked the SA for delivery before sunset. The vehicle was readied by afternoon and we took the delivery in by 4 PM. Got a goodie bag from Mahindra during delivery which contained a keyring, a microfibre cloth, a coffee mug and folder for documents and a box of Ferrero-Rocher chocolates. That added extra sweetness to the whole process. The delivery process was smooth and didn't take long. We distributed some sweets and headed straight to the accessories shop Car ready for delivery: Performing the Puja: That mandatory pic with the new car: The goodie bag: ", 2nd March 2023,mahindra-xuv300,PUNE,17,52,Entertainment/Navigation/Connectivity (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

The engine refinement + the Ride quality are unmatched by the competition with what the XUV offers.

Reliable FE figures, relaxing highway drives and enough torque to make any overtaking move. I personally feel Diesels will be put to death in the lower segment cars very soon, in the next 5 years or so. We have already seen this trend happening for many manufacturers with the latest being Honda kicking out the Diesel option for the 2023 City. Mahindra and Tata will likely hold on to diesels for longer considering they have a pedigree in Diesels but with their active focus on EVs, its definitely a ticking bomb.

My last full servicing was roughly the same cost bracket as what I paid for my previous petrol car. Plus I have 2 team-mates with petrol 3OOs, and I've seen their service figures in the same neighbourhood as mine.

I might be biased, but I found the diesel on the 3OO to be the more fun option. It's a boon to drive in cities thanks to the diesel low end pull, and it has loads of grunt in the mid range to keep it cruising on the highways. Diesel + cruise control = match made in heaven.

When I first bought it in March '21, I had apprehensions about buying a Mahindra and my first diesel car. My trusted mechanic who did the PDI and drove for 20 km before delivery told me this will just keep on running. Having upgraded the speakers, it was pure bliss driving. The 3 point seat belt having been installed earlier there was still one thing bugging me, which was the r 16 spare tyre. I ordered a r 17 steel rim from Boodmo and they delivered the correct size at the 3rd attempt. As I had changed the tyres to Conti at 20000 km, I fit the old MRF Ecotred to the new rim. The fit was very snug, and one has to put down the back seat to slide it in and was able to fit the boot floor at the lower level without problems.

Not even a puncture for that matter (touchwood) haha. The overall experience so far has been epic. While the car/product from Mahindra has been top notch, I've had mixed feelings when it comes to Mahindra SVCs. FYI I purchased the car and did my first service in Mumbai (Randhawa Motors) and then had to move my base to Bangalore. I did my 1st paid service (10k kms from) from Mahindra India Garage - ITPL, Bangalore. The car was delivered by 7 pm in complete darkness and this resulted in not being able to see the mess they had done to the inside of my car. To my horror, the next day I saw dirt stains all over the dashboard, side door upholstery and sunroof panel. It was pretty obvious that the mechanic who was working on the car either did not work with proper gloves or had extremely dirty hands! Something you would expect from a road side garage and not from a reputed luxury SUV brand. Sadly when reported to the SVC SM (Mr. Niranjan), there was a deaf silence. I finally got a response from him after 1.5 months that too after pestering him with calls/Whatsapp over that period. I was adamant that they acknowledge this. I am now planning to give my car at Anant Cars, Marathahalli for all future service/ quick work. Kindly let me know in case any of you guys have given it there.

1027, ExtremePocca , 23:06 ,BHPian,"Well, it seems that headlight upgrades are a recurring theme in this thread. This time, I'm the one looking for some headlights for the XUV 3OO. There are some basic requirements that shouldn't be too hard to meet. Criteria 1. LEDs with a colour temperature of 6000k. 2. Plug and play installation. Must not void warranty. 3. Must be from a reputed brand. 4. Noticeable improvement required. (Duh) Now, with the criteria listed out, let me explain the reasoning behind them. 1. The bulbs for all the lights (Low beam, High beam and fog lamps) must be LED. I understand that the LED is the only bulb that can produce the bright white light that I require for both safety and aesthetic reasons without breaking the bank. The temperature must be 6000k for partly aesthetics and mostly safety. Halogens are amber and I feel that they cannot mimic the daylight effect that LEDs produce. 2. The 2nd point is obvious, the car is just a year old (Review might be coming) and we have the 4th or 5th (can't remember) year extended warranty package. 3. Multiple trips to multiple ""auto modding"" shops have been made, and what I've learnt over the course of these multiple visits is that these shops mainly sell LEDs in nondescript white boxes with weird wattage based performance rating systems. I have read a thread about DIY LED headlight upgrades made by BHPian Cresterk and so far what I've learnt is that these headlights are, to put it lightly, not the best. Instead, I'm looking for something from well reputed brands such as Phillips, Osram and TVS. 4. I think this point is pretty self explanatory. Other thoughts I have indeed done some very limited and possibly flawed research and found these options. 1. PHILIPS H8/H11/H16 11366UEX2 Ultinon Essential LED Fog Lights 6000K Luxeon - These bulbs seem compatible with the car. They are the correct type of bulb (H16) and have the correct wattage as well (16W). They are also 6000k and don't seem to be too expensive (~2000rs a bulb). They also come in a pair. 2.PHILIPS H7 Ultinon Pro3021 LED Headlight Bulb for Car and Truck - Now I intend to use these for the low beams. These are the correct type of bulb (H7) but, the only point of concern is the low wattage (20W per bulb). Should I be concerned about this? I know that in the world of LEDs 20W is enough but it still feels odd going from a 55W halogen to a 20W LED. The model promises a compact design which should hopefully fit well inside the projector housing of the car without any issues. The price is also satisfactory at ~2800rs per bulb (Comes in a pair). 3. Nothing - I haven't done much research about the high beam but I do know that BHPian ashishk_29 (sorry if I got the number or the entire name wrong) bought some TVS LEDs for his high beam. I wouldn't mind installing the same if it meant I could finish the LED upgrade without spending more than 15k. If the bulb costs more than ~5000rs for a pair (unlikely) then I will need to purchase something different. Anyway, it's time to conclude this rather long post. Thanks in advance to those who can help me out of this dilemma. Also an ownership review might be on the cards.", 20th March 2023,mahindra-xuv300,Kolkata,31,60,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

Halogen bulbs require significantly more power to generate the same amount of light compared to LEDs. So LEDs will be lower wattage than halogens, but that's just because LEDs generate light more efficiently, and hence they use lower power. So feel free to ignore the wattage ratings. As long as it doesn't exceed the wattage specified for your car, you're fine.

There are many spare fuses in the fuse box and to my surprise all of them had a voltage across them when I tested them. I used a multimeter to identify two fuses, one for when the ACC is on and another when the car is completely off. I'd suggest doing the same and use the SPARE fuses so that there is literally no chance of impacting any other output. As a reference guide, use the below YouTube video. Almost ALL of the other tutorials do not go into the detail about polarity and stuff. If you're planning a DIY (which I strongly recommend), you can refer the below video and follow the process that he follows to the tee. My installation turned out to be extremely good thanks to this video. For a DIY, you'll definitely need a multimeter.

They were also not ready with me buying the bulb and them doing only the fitting - most probably because they have some tie up with distributors. The HID conversion is quite easy and Reinhard's thread on his DIY explains the steps really well.

In fact, it is easier on XUV300 because both LHS and RHS bulbs are easily accessible. Also, Reinhard's DIY talks about a tricky part involving the retaining clips that hold the bulb. While that is true for some of the older conversion kits, new HID conversion kits come with bulb adapter mechanisms that avoids the whole retainer clip issue.

1061, ss11011988 , 13:49 ,BHPian,"Gentlemen, I have couple of queries for the proud owners, appreciate it if you can clarify the same for me. I am about to buy my first car, and I have shortlisted XUV300 along with Maruti Fronx(though I know it doesn't classify as a C-SUV) and Kia Sonet. As this is our first car, we are not sure on the average running aspects. My requirements are : 1. Proven build quality 2. Competent and punchy engines with smooth drivetrain 3. Good interior space management 4. Good ASS experience(Currently residing at Bengaluru) 5. Long term reliability For most of the time, the passengers are going to be me and my wife, with our parents being the additional ones during our home state visits. Our journey would generally involve interstate trips, hence majority of the time will be spent on highways with occasional city drives. I love driving, so I hate vehicles with dud engines. I am a sucker for turbo diesels, mainly for the addictive turbo surge and the excellent drivability / efficiency ratio it offers, however the future of diesel vehicles, DPF issues and the NGT threat looms in my mind as I plan to hold on to the car for next 8-10 years. Which brings me to my queries if at all I'm going for the XUV300 : 1. As this is our first car, should I settle down with a petrol instead of the diesel? 2. In the scenario that I'm going for the petrol variant, what is the real world mileage I can expect? 3. In the scenario that I'm going for the diesel, should I be worried about the DPF issues in this car? I have been diligently reading members' posts to avoid the same, but I would like to hear it from you all still. 4. Have you felt the footwell area to be cramped especially around the clutch? I'm 5'10"" and I recently took a test drive of the 1.2 manual Petrol car and I found little to no space to rest my left foot thanks to the absence of a dead pedal. 5. ASS experience. I know it's a hit or miss, but I guess its better than Tata. 6. Any de-facto niggles I should be worried about? 7. Longevity of the 1.2 Petrol engine. I know Mahindra have a proven track record when it comes to diesel engines, but not so sure on the petrol engines.

1062, Kosfactor , 14:54 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"^ Sonet is the best overall vehicle in that segment. I think you should test drive the Sonet DCT, XUV3OO petrol turbo sport if you are into MT as well as the Venue N line DCT if you are okay with automatic. Fronx will be a lot more affordable than all those vehicles but practicality wise it will be more like a hatchback than a sub compact SUV, like the seating position and boot space etc, so keep that as an option if budget constraints are there, otherwise go with the above options first. XUV3OO is a bigger vehicle that has been shrunk to fit the segment, so it is the largest vehicle of the lot and drives very well, very confident at high speeds. I`d go with mStallion that is in TurboSport version or Hyundai \ KIA`s GDi in terms of punchy petrol engines.", 21st June 2023,mahindra-xuv300,COK\BLR\MYS,"3,579","10,063",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
1063, RohanPitre , 19:52 ,BHPian,"I've been looking for a 2nd car. I currently drive a Ameo Diesel DSG. I may have to start travelling to Mumbai for my office and hence need a 2nd car for my parents. My dad is retired & engages in land dealing. Mom is working and has slight issues with her knees and doesn't like the low sitting & short space of Ameo at all. So when we started looking out, I was really considering MS Fronx turbo. Decent seating height & ground clearance, MS reliability and perfectly good for city usage. But then the prices were announced and I instantly shifted focus to Baleno 1.2 Alpha. While the reliability aspect remains, the GC & seating height isn't favourable. I also looked at Brezza ZXi and liked the seating position. The knee-room is less, but shoulder room is good & back contouring is good for 3 people (we are a family of 5). However, no dealership in my town has the AT for test drive & the waiting period claimed is 6 months. That's too long and I can't book the car without test drive. In the middle of all this, I came across a 2020 XUV300 with 11.5k on the ODO. It's a W6 Diesel AMT variant. The quoted price is 11.25L and I'm sure it can be negotiated to some extent. Test drove the car and found no issues with it at all. Since it's from 2020, it comes with the normal touch screen display and no sunroof. The only redflag was that a rear camera was installed on the car, integrated into IRVM (indicating it's after-market). I will need to check it's service history & will also get it reviewed from Mahindra dealership in the town. Now I'm confused if I should buy the new Baleno Alpha/Fronx Delta+ AMT, or go with this XUV300. Both cost me between 11-12L. Maruti scores on reliability, piece of mind and new car advantages (resale, better interior, feature); while Mahindra is safer, has more space for 5, is leagues ahead in driving pleasure. It will be used by my parents and hence I don't want a car that might pop up issues every now & then. But then, in the rare occasions when it's used on highways, safety comes into play too. The facelifted XUV coming next year is also making me question if this is the best time to buy this car.

1068, ss11011988 , 12:08 ,BHPian,"Dear all, Thank you all for your inputs. I got a chance to do an extended test drive of the 1.2 TGDI and the 1.5 Diesel mills(both manual only) and it has created quite a bit of dilemma for me. 1. 1.2 TGDI :- Extremely refined for a 3-cylinder motor while on standstill and on the move. Low speed drivability is good, but not diesel level good. It passed the second gear speed breaker test alright however low rpms will make the engine protest and I had to shift it to first at times. But all those qualms go away once the turbo comes to life. This car can reach silly speeds real quick and in a very addictive manner, so one has to keep themself in check while driving this car. Roll on acceleration was impressive, and I felt that this car could give some bigger cars a run for their money. I also felt that this car could cruise better with such abundant power in reserve. The only con will be the fuel economy's inverse relationship with your enthusiastic right foot . 2. 1.5 Diesel :- Extremely refined for a diesel mill. I mean, for a test drive car that has covered 30k+ kms and encountered all sorts of drivers, it still felt refined. The clutch is comparatively heavy and with the long travel would create some discomfort during stop and go traffic. It shines when it comes to drivability and efficiency. It easily passed second gear unscientific speed breaker tests without a fuss. Though not 1.2 TGDI quick, it can build up speeds pretty quickly without any fuss and could cruise comfortably all day along on long interstate trips thanks to the abundant reserves of torque and being lighter on the pocket by returning better fuel efficiency. No doubts on the reliability aspect as Mahindra have perfected the art of churning out refined and potent diesel mills. Which brings me to my dilemma. If I go with the 1.2 TGDI, I can put all diesel related worries to rest for the next 10 years. It will bring a smile to my face every time I take it out on the open roads. It will be comparatively cheaper to own and maintain. It can also erase my smile real quick due to higher fuel bills as the mStallion motors are not known to be particularly fuel efficient. But as couple of the BHPians pointed out in their ownership reviews, you don't ask the efficiency of a Turbosport and you don't buy one for its fuel efficiency. Also, the reliability aspects of this engine looms high, as this is a brand-new motor. If I go with the diesel, it will reward me with excellent drivability while not compromising on fuel efficiency even with an enthusiastic right foot, which is one reason why I love diesel cars. Fuel station visits will be less frequent and such visits will not give me a heartburn. However, the maintenance costs will be comparatively higher and BS-6 diesel engine woes and future of this fuel will nag my mind (pardon me, I have low to medium levels of OCD which makes me overthink and worry a lot) as my monthly running will average less than 1000kms. It is comparatively expensive on the road as well. Or, I could make a compromise and settle for the normal 1.2 Turbo petrol which will offer me decent mileage while being cheaper to buy and maintain in the long run.

I don’t want to confuse you if you’ve already made up your mind. I went with Diesel for two reasons (1) Long highway runs are more pleasurable in a Diesel with their torquey engines (2) Wanted to grab hold of one before they become artefacts (same reason as yours). I’m thoroughly happy with my car and the diesel engine is a gem! Also, I don’t run the car that frequently - every month or two, we do a couple of long highway runs. That’s about it. I’d only advice against a BS6 Diesel if your running is exclusively in the city and especially short commutes. I see you’re in Bangalore, so the average speed during weekdays and peak hours will be 15-20kph max - this is not actually that great for BS6 diesels. But if there is even one good stretch of 20mins with higher speeds of 60kph, that should be fine. Or else, make it a point to drive on one of the highways for a weekend breakfast run. It is ultimately going to be a heart vs. head decision. I went with Diesel even though I really didn’t have to. Btw, insurance can be heavily negotiated further. I was quoted some 45-50k initially and got it down to 30k. You can get a quote from any Policybazaar or any of the insurance websites and ask them to price match - usually they’ll have a ton of addons which are absolutely useless - for example, they’ll have an engine cover but the insurance already provides engine cover, the addon is on those extreme events which might not even be applicable. Another common one is, RSA - Mahindra itself will provide the RSA and you should buy that. The one with insurance can be removed. Once you trim all this fat, the price will automatically come down. I negotiated hard and was able to get the offer down to within 1-2k of what was there in online websites.", 28th June 2023,mahindra-xuv300,Bangalore,613,"2,660",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Positive

The length of the gear stick acts as a lever, hence reducing the amount of force you have to apply to change gears. With a shortened stick you might have to exert more force. Plus, for me it's at the perfect height of the arm-rest. So I can make some shifts while resting my arm there. So I wouldn't want to change it in my setting.", 2nd August 2023,mahindra-xuv300,Pune,552,789,Entertainment/Navigation/Connectivity (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

I don't think the throw will change. The throw isn't determined by the length of the gear shaft. It's determined by how much the shifter assembly underneath needs to move to push the gearbox into shifting. This is how a modern day shifter assembly works. The perceived ""length"" of the shift is determined by how far the cables have to move to change gears. The shifter visible in the car is the upper half of the lever. It has a fulcrum in the middle, and connections to the cables below. The cables below will still have to move the same length irrespective of the height of the gear shifter shaft.", 2nd August 2023,mahindra-xuv300,Pune,552,789,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Negative

Im experiencing the exact same issue- the gear lever gets stuck in reverse. Its a recurring problem that happens almost everyday. Once, the gear even malfunctioned while I was using it in the manual mode. The screen flashed gear malfunction message. I slowly stopped on the side of the road to restart the car and thankfully it was back to normal. Its been 3 days since its been at the Mahindra NBS, Sewri workshop. Im yet to hear back from them about what is the diagnosis. Ill write here once the workshop gets back to me with something. Workshops too seem extremely overwhelmed by a huge number of Mahindra cars coming in for service and maintenance. Ive also been experiencing a huge drop in the pickup of the car. Especially when its fully loaded with four passengers and luggage. There is a very evident difference while overtaking on the highways. The pickup used to be much better earlier. Another issue is with the suspension. Lately the drive has been feeling very rough. I can feel the bumps inside the car more prominently. Even my wife noticed the ride quality has become evidently less comfortable even in the passenger seat. The service advisor is refusing to accept that this is a problem. Has anyone else here has faced a badly ageing suspension, faulty gear lever and lower pickup too? We bought this car because we were pleasantly surprised by its comfort and power. But in just 2 years these very basic mechanical advantages of this car are starting to fade. Any suggestions on how to maintain these basic qualities of the XUV300?

Will it be for 1.4km in city traffic to the nearest tyre shop? OR Will it be for 26km to the nearest town on a high-speed motorway? In other words -- will your upcoming running be city or highway? 2) Are you likely to run through this new set of tyres in the next 2 years and 2 months? If yes, then you could put off the spare replacement till then. If you keep the spare, you just need to remember that IF you use it, you should go easy on it (low speed / stress).

1096, ExtremePocca , 17:38 ,BHPian,"Christmas Catastrophe I consult you once again, fellow bhpians. This is a really old problem I refrained from posting due to a personal situation (read laziness). Our XUV on the day of Christmas last year refused to start. Nothing seemed to be out of order during this ordeal, we could hear the healthy fuel pump buzz upon starting the car in accessories mode and the starter would run at a perfectly normal speed. Lights worked, ICE worked, everything was fine. My dad called the withyouhamesha helpline and it took around an hour and a half of telling the guys to get a move on for them to show up. Mind you, this entire ordeal took place in our garage, and our house isn't in any sort of remote spot or anything. After a pretty infuriating wait during which we tried cranking the car for around 10 seconds every 10 to 15 minutes, the RSA guy showed up with a dilapidated scooter holding a spare battery. He tried starting the car to no avail and concluded by saying we needed to call a tow truck. At that moment my heart sunk, not because of the tow truck, but at the thought of trying to get the car out of the garage. Our garage is notoriously difficult to get out of, and the XUV just about fits. Getting this 1500kg tank out of the garage would be a herculean task for whoever would have the misfortune of being entrusted with it. As a last hail-Mary the following day, at 9pm we called an FNG who used to work on my dad's prehistoric Santro. The guy showed up, walked in and nonchalantly just turned the engine one in a jiffy, no weird noises, no misfiring or anything. He did rev the engine at around 4k rpm for like 30 seconds while it was cold but what do you know? It worked just fine. I let the car idle for 2 or 3 minutes while my dad got dressed and we left for the SC straight away. One noteworthy observation was a little bit of water leaking from the exhaust tip, the amount was very small however. During our drive to the SC nothing was out of the ordinary, and our service advisor remarked there were no codes or warning lights. He kept the car under observation for a day as we had a 400km trip planned and wanted the car to be in perfect condition. The car came back working as intended, no signs of it being inoperational for 2 days. And that's where it ended. The car has been working for these last 9 months as usual. It is however important to note that in the days prior to the failure, the car started taking longer and longer to start and sometimes took 2 or 3 cranks. During this period, I could sometimes here a piston or two fire and then my dad would have to crank it again. My hypothesis is, our car struggles to start in even just slightly cold weather such as 25 to 30 degrees centigrade. With winter nor far away, I wanted to ensure we don't get a repeat of the 2022 Christmas catastrophe, any inputs on this would be highly appreciated", 15th September 2023,mahindra-xuv300,Kolkata,31,60,All-Wheel/4-Wheel Drive,Very Negative

But the situation was different. Dad was getting to know the car and went to a nearby shop by it. Once he was there, he called saying the car won't restart.

Since I was worried about the low temps, I would start the car each morning and let it idle for 3-5 minutes in Kullu and Manali (we decided to use local taxis for local travel). But there was not once instance of the car not starting on the first crank. And this was in ambient temps around 5. So the next time an instance like this happens where the car does not start, start with trouble shooting the basics and then move on to the RSA/Towing/FnG etc. More often than not, the basics are missed which cause the most trouble.

I did lots of troubleshooting during this weird stage but everything seemed to be ok? the starter cranked at the normal speed, the fuel pump made the buzzing noise it's supposed to and we had plenty of voltage in the battery. The possibility of bad fuel is unlikely considering my dad only gets petrol from 2 of his preferred pumps. A bad fuel injector could have been the issue but the car drives just fine. Here is something I noticed but forgot to add in the original post. The car displays some odd behaviors when starting in this weird state. I'll try my best to explain this with a video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzXcjxtaGvc I don't really know what this is called but notice how the revs fluctuate once the car starts and settles down in a matter of a second and then revs drop even more in a minute or two once the engine warms up. Well the first rev ""spike"" happens in our car as well, but on cold days where it takes a few more cycles of the starter motor to start the car, this spike in revs doesn't happen once starting and instead rises to 2.5k rpms once my dad starts accelerating gently to roll out of the garage. The struggling cold starts are also accompanied by a very strong smell of petrol. The car is working just fine, and out on the open road it still got it's fantastic characteristics, but the reliability of our car in particular is getting me a bit worried for the winter season. Even now on the days where the temperature is near 28 degrees celsius (due to rain), the car displays some of those struggling characteristics during a cold start.", 15th September 2023,mahindra-xuv300,Kolkata,31,60,Entertainment/Navigation/Connectivity (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

I first rang the number in the With you Hamesha app. The call centre folks guided me nicely, and they would say that they were transferring my call to the RSA helpline. Which didn't happen. Twice. So then the second service person gave me a direct RSA helpline number, where I generated the request. A local battery guy came by immediately with a spare battery, and gave me a jumpstart. I kept the car idling for about half an hour then, but now I had the ""check engine"" light ON. So I kept the car idling, then went out for a short drive, and parked.

I have had LEDs as my upper beam for a long time. But that's the thing. It's the upper beam, so not as frequently used. I haven't used them at length because roads requiring constant upper beam are rare. I think they should work fine, because the volume inside the 300's headlight units is quite large. Canbus is just an electronic communication channel by which the ECU talks to the various devices in the car. You will not have to replace it. Or anything. LEDs are plug and play. They come with sockets that match the ones in your car. You just plug them in, and that's that.", 16th November 2023,mahindra-xuv300,Pune,552,789,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

We are based outta Delhi. Daily use is about 15km with occasional highway runs. Our budget is under 12L on road. We're interested in a no nonsense, least electronics based vehicle. Safety is the only priority along with ample space for 5 ( occasionally) and some performance in the engine. We intend to keep the vehicle for as long as possible (We also have a very well maintained 31 year old Maruti 800 which is outside Delhi.) We have never sold any vehicle we've owned. Ritz will be the first and it is heartbreaking. Nexon, Sonet, Astor, Exter are not even considered for various reasons. I am trying to pursue her for an Amaze or even check out the base model Elevate. We might have to stretch by a lakh tho. Inputs are welcome on the Elevate. We have seen and TD the Brezza VXi ( booked it even but cancelled it due to long wait ) she kinda likes it , although i found the engine to be very anaemic and lethargic tho. It was comfortable to be on the driver seat, almost felt like home and alright on the backseat ( i felt the seat to be very low slung at the back ) If we do end up buying it it'll be a head over heart decision for me, unlike our previous purchases of the Honda and Ritz. Me and my dad also visited the Mahindra showroom Kirti Nagar to check out the XUV 300 and both of us were impressed with it. Especially the engine. We're looking at the base model. The problem - 1. It is a Mahindra. 2. We spoke to a taxi driver who had a 2 month old diesel 300 and he advised against it. His words ""Lotta noise over 90kmph and low FE"". FE is ok, but noise? Not sure if we're ok with that. 3. How will this car age. Especially the engine and other mechanical components. We take care of our cars and never push them to test their limits. Our japs have aged beautifully and we're unsure of the Mahindra. The older scorpios and tatas with black smoke hasn't left a good impression on my father to place bets on an Indian brand. Honestly.

We have plenty of Mahindras in friends and family and except for a few manageable issues, no major after-sales issues till date.

One can even touch 20 kmpl mark if driven carefully. This taxi guy is definitely doing something wrong. 3 - My close friend has a 2019 model with 80k+ km on the odo, and no major issues till date. Mahindra engines are top notch, by any standards in the country. Mechanicals are great too. But be ready to expect minor niggles every now and then, especially electrical issues. Don't expect Maruti/Toyota level of reliability but you won't have to worry about reliability much. XUV300 petrol is a superb vehicle with a great engine, build quality, and ample space. Just don't expect it to be very fuel efficient and you're good. 4 - Mahindra A.S.S is certainly better than Tata's but still nowhere near the industry benchmark. As stated previously, it is acceptable in most cases. Also, I'd suggest you stick with the authorized dealership for regular servicing and retain your warranty for as long as possible. With the ongoing discounts, you can easily fit a W6 petrol MT in your budget and save a ton of money.", 17th December 2023,mahindra-xuv300,UK03/04/06/07,266,598,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

In fact, it's the refinement levels that really won me over when I was browsing the car originally. And mind you, my test drive car at the showroom was a 41000km run vehicle. Showroom cars are abused to the maximum, and that 41000km run vehicle had 80% of the refinement levels of my Jazz. ""Lotta noise above 90kmph"" absolutely untrue. I have done upwards of 170kmph in my car, and the engine starts to get a little noisy around 150kmph, being a diesel. But at that point wind noise will not let much of engine noise through.

1130, ashishk29 , 22:44 ,BHPian,"It's been a wild couple of days... So about 3 days back, I noticed that my usual key fob didn't work by using the request sensor on the door, but unlocked fine using the buttons on the fob. I didn't think it was a big deal. A day later, even that didn't work anymore. I had to unlock the car using the physical key within the fob, and of course that set off the alarm Why? If it's an authorised key, the alarm shouldn't be based off of how the car was locked the last time around. (For the benefit of any who were unaware of this as I was, the car will sound the alarm if you don't use the same method to unlock as the last lock. So if I lock using the fob, and then unlock using the same physical key, it fires the alarm) So now I had to get in the car, hold the fob at the start/stop button to get it on. Ok. So far so good. Car started fine. And then it kept beeping for ""Key not in car"" for the next several minutes. I stop at a signal, power the car off, and then on again, and this warning goes away. (WHY?!) I reach my office, come back to the parking an hour later, and somehow the damn fob works?! HOW?! And somehow in the evening, the fob doesn't work again. Surprise surprise. All is fine, I come back home, and my first assumption was, yeah, fob battery must've died. So I went inside my home, got my spare fob, which was unused for the last 2 years by the way! And whaddaya know. Same problem even with THIS key. I was completely befuddled. How can I have a dead battery in BOTH my keys despite the complete opposite use?! I was almost convinced there was something wrong with my car. Took it down to the showroom, and of course the service assistant suggests the first thing to try, change the fob batteries. ""Anyway workshop will ask for the same thing"" he says. Fair enough. At first he changed the battery in one fob. And whadday know, it worked. I asked him to get in the car and fire it up to confirm. He does that, then powers off. However, as he was doing this, I accidentally clicked the button on the other fob which was in my hand, which did NOT have its battery replaced. And it worked?! (Again, WHY?!) Anyway, he replaced the battery in the second fob as well, and so far things have been ok. But this raises several concerns for me: 1. Why did the fobs work intermittently for some time? 2. WHY this stupid notion that a physical key unlock will sound the alarm? They have RFID chips inside the keys, can't the damn car detect it's a valid key?! 3. Why can't the car warn me when the fob battery is running low? I talked to a couple of my colleagues, and they said their car cluster warns them of low fob battery. In start/stop type cars, this needs to be mandatory. 4. I am still not convinced that somehow BOTH my fobs were dead at the same time. Apart from this, got the ECU/EMS updated flashed at the same place. 15 minutes job, I was in and out before I knew it.

It simply has caught you at a wrong threshold, where the cell voltage is at the borderline between 'good' and 'bad' for the fob transmitter to work. So it has appeared mystical to you. The discharge curve is not a smooth straight line. But a jagged line over 10's of millivolts. This would happen for a couple of days and the fobs stop working altogether. (I've noticed this pattern of cell death in Honda City, Wagon R, Ford Ikon. Of course there the keys were only to lock/unlock). 2. That goes down to the circuitry. Mechanical intrusion is seen as a mechanical intrusion. I'm not saying it's an intelligent way of addressing the issue. It's just a cheap way I guess. But even if a system were there to detect the original key, your cell was dead, so there's no way of telling. Maybe I should experiment with mine and check, one early morning 3. I'm surprised that the car didn't warn you. Hope someone from Mahindra reads this! 4. You could find literature that talks about constant drain (spare key fob) killing the primary cell faster than a similar primary cell subjected to the same constant drain with occasional discharge spikes (main key fob). It's not intuitive but you've to go into the working of a lithium primary cell to understand this phenomenon. Bottom-line, it's completely normal.

What i find different with XUV 300 as compared to Maruti & Hyundai & Tata that i've driven before is - In case of the 1st & 2nd Gear only - one really needs to FLOOR the clutch pedal to the last millimeter for a smooth slotting. Floor it real hard. Try and do this very consciously for a few times and see if you notice the difference. Over a period it'll become a habit. I am an owner of XUV 300 Petrol since the last two years and even today - sometime the clutch isn't floored the gear don't slot smoothly. Other cars like Maruti, Hyunday etc - will give your some leeway - not XUV.

But the car DOES have a way of detecting an original key even if the cell is dead: RF. That's how the start/stop button is able to detect the key fob and start the car. I remember reading about this in Maruti context some while back, but they started putting RFID chips in their physical keys, which the car would ""validate"" before unlocking. I am vehemently positive that this should work in a modern day 2023 car as well! The system should be able to detect an original key through RFID. But it may just be down to cost-cutting to not include an RFID detector at the keyhole. Who knows. Quote: Originally Posted by Sachin_s74 Hello Ashish I also face this sometimes..

1140, TORQUEINDUCTION , 23:17 ,Newbie,"Hello everyone, first and foremost a big thanks to the Team BHP mods for approving the membership. I have been following the forum for close to a decade and am glued to the screen for updates and discussions. I am a Mechanical engineer by profession and working in product design for diesel engines. Started driving late when I was 30 years old on a diesel Ritz which was brought preowned. This was the point when I fell in love with diesel engines and was addicted to the torque and the turbo boost. After using Ritz for around 1.6L Kms, bought XUV 300 Diesel, for pretty much the same reason. Coming to bikes, I have a 2002 Yamaha RX135 which is in fairly good shape and daily duties of grocery and market runs are carried out by 2019 Jupiter. On personal front, am married with 10 year old son. I would like to pen down a small observations of my red XUV 300 which was purchased in April 2023. As of today, it has completed 13500 kms and going strong. Some positives: 1. Torque, torque and plenty of torque, engine performance 2. Silent engine 3. Cabin is nicely insulated 4. Build quality is good, car is heavy and maintains composure at high speeds 5. 5 star safety 6. Good legroom at rear 7. Bonnet visible from driver seat Not so good: 1. Not many users have listed, but I feel the air conditioning is not powerful in peak afternoon, its good in evenings or mornings, but it takes time to cool the cabin in sunny afternoons. It does its job, but I have seen people mentioning bone chiller A/C for some cars, its not definitely the case with XUV300. 2. I have see a couple of owners mentioning about steering loosing control on rumblers. Is this a case for everyone or is this faced by a small group or batch of cars. Wanted inputs since we have seen that the car was recalled for suspension issues earlier. I too face this issue and am extra careful on the rumbler strips. 3. Is it me or has anyone faced that the front suspension bottoms out on bit high speed breakers. If speed is less, this does not happen, but even is the speed is bit more, the car comes down with a big thud. Should I get the car inspected. Typical in cities with speed of 30 to 35 kmph. 4. Again a small observation, brakes are very good at high speed, does inspire confidence, but when at low speeds in city (around 40-50), the bite seems less. Has anyone experienced this? Apart from this, the car is hoot to drive and probably the last diesel car I will own. I recently completed a 4000 kms trip from Pune to Kanyakumari. Will certainly pen down in travelogues section.", 8th February 2024,mahindra-xuv300,Pune,12,31,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

I too face this issue and am extra careful on the rumbler strips. I have also experienced this but I rather firmly believe this is not an issue with the suspension, but rather a result of the suspension being on the stiffer side. I think the suspension tries to maintain a level since it does not decompress fully between the ""rumbles"", and hence gives a ""floaty"" feeling. For more such experiences from folks with other cars, have a look at: https://www.reddit.com/r/CarsIndia/c...ing_on_rumble/ I can see comments from folks with Polo, Nexon, and other cars.

Nowadays it appears even on little bad roads also (odo 30,000 Km). Car was examined by M & M service centre - Twice, no relief. Suspension has no issues on examination. The service centre person told that he needs to open whole dash board for it - I refused. What could be the reason of this noise?

I think due to the facelift around the corner, dealer is keen to give away old stock at discounts. But my worry is, why is a 2022 XUV300 still lying around with them?? In case it is worth it, how much of a discount should I be looking at? It is a W8 (O) Diesel MT. I really want to wait for the facelift but knowing Mahindra prices, my worry is it will probably be close to 19-20 OTR for the top end since the current one is already touching 17.5, thereby putting it out of budget for me.
