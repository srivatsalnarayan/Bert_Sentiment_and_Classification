It's not the best when it comes to interiors, but we still decided to go for it. Presenting the Renault Kiger 2022 | RXZ 1.0 Turbo | CVT What I like - Stunning Presence and Design from all angles - Fun Turbo Engine (~99 bhp) with elements like drive mode - Smooth CVT gearbox - Well tuned suspension learning from it's elder brother, Duster - Very spacious even in the back seat - 405 ltrs of boot space with 60:40 split foldable rear seats - Storage everywhere including a cooling glovebox - Cruise Control is a bliss on the highway - Pretty decent ICE with ARKAMYS 8 speaker 3D sound setup - Wireless charging along with wireless Android Auto. It supports Apple Carplay as well - Particulate Matter 2.5 filter. A welcome feature in these times - 5 Years extended warranty and Easycare which allows 0 expense on service for 3+ years What I do not like - The interior quality. Can live with it and that's more like it. - Some weird ergonomics like the seat belt lock almost hidden - The dashboard is too animated for my taste but some loved it - Turbo lag at lower speeds as expected - Lack of some much needed features like ESP, Hill descent control - Loading lip is high and takes some effort for heavy luggage - No sunroof.

1, abhisheksircar , 09:46 ,BHPian,"My wife has been driving a Celerio VXi AMT for the last 7 years. There has been no major issues in the car at all and the car was in pretty good shape. But she didn't like the AMT gear box. It was not responsive and jerky like every other AMT gearbox. We learnt to adapt and drive to match it's behavior but that's the most we could do. What we also missed are safety features. This was a bare bone skeleton. It had seat belts ! We were contemplating a change and in came the Baleno 2022. We are a family pampered by the Suzuki sales and service experience. We knew all the right people out there in the dealer team when needed to connect. Baleno 2022 ticked all the right boxes but for the unknown AMT again. We were told that it's much more smoother but no cars to test it. We had to trust it's smooth enough. We booked the car prelaunch and saw the car on the day of launch and it was absolutely amazing. Loaded to the brim and quite good quality. And then came the long wait. We were told that the delivery will be within a month, since we booked prelaunch. After 45 days, we get an email saying that it will take a month or two more from the earlier promised time. We could wait but we did a blunder by trusting the earlier commitment and sold off our Celerio. We got a reasonable resale value to a known person and we sold it off. I even ordered a TPH cover to make sure it's protected from Day 1. The email of further delay was a bummer. We started looking around for other options which can be quicker to deliver. Just few days back, I drove a friend's CVT Magnite and I quite liked the transmission and feel factor. Having the same platform, I considered the Kiger. I called up a dealer in JP Nagar as I had their number from the day I was looking for a new car 7 years back as I was interested in the Fluence. The dealer had a Blue Renault RXZ 1.0 Turbo CVT which was allocated to a customer but he wanted a month more since his house construction got delayed by a month. Which means, the car is in Bangalore already, March 2022 Manufactured as per the VIN and ready to be registered and delivered in a week. Perfect !! We still asked for a test drive, more for my wife than me as it was for her. First look of it and she was quite intimidated by the size of it, coming from the humble Celerio. She immediately got into two minds of, should I ? She liked the looks of the car. She got in and drove it within the narrow roads around our vicinity. She loved the seat height and the smooth gearshifts. The suspension was handling the bad roads quite well. I was sitting in the back and was amused to see her driving at 60 km/hr and telling the salesman that one should not drive fast in these roads. I asked her to check the Speedo. She was shocked as she didn't even realize. She immediately slowed down and the salesman suggested her to try the more sedated Eco mode. She was comfortable with that. She ended the drive saying that this was it. Although it's bigger and more intimidating, it drives quite easy and comfortable. This was a real upgrade for her. What it ended up with was for us to spend another 2 lakhs but since we keep our cars for long, we thought it's worth it. The car that came in for test was the Red 2021 CVT RXZ Turbo and hence we then drove to the showroom, where they had a blue 2022 RXZ CVT one in display. We saw it and immediately booked it. This was it !", 20th April 2022,renault-kiger,Bangalore,522,"1,717"
2, abhisheksircar , 11:57 ,BHPian,"So what were the options available ? My bible to see all that's available has usually been the Indian Car Sales report on Team Bhp. This time it was no different. Car Sales - Feb 2022 Citroen : Nothing from this stable as it was beyond the budget. Datsun : Nothing exciting here. Honda : Jazz. This was one contender but the age old design and with not much Focus to the Indian market, I decided to steer clear off the brand. Also, I do not like the snob behavior of the sales team. Hyundai : We considered the Hyundai i20 or the Venue. We struck off the i20 cause we now had a taste of a crossover/compact-SUV and the Venue, till date remains a strong contender. It's just that we get better VFM with the Kiger and the biggest drawback was the wait time. If we had a ready available Venue, it would probably have been the Venue cause it's proven and will have a better resale value but then I was not aligned with how it looked. Jeep : Nothing from this stable as it was beyond the budget. Kia : Sonet. This again was a strong contender but for the deterrence of a long wait time. Else it was a close call between the Sonet and the Venue. The other factor was also the cost factor as we had already stretched our budget on the Kiger and these two options would have further stretched it. Mahindra : XUV300 is the only option we could have considered but for AMT. Maruti : Wait time of Baleno is similar with other products in the stable as well and hence this went off the list too. MG : I somehow do not connect to this brand for the sheer reason of re-badging some Chinese Cars as MG. Baojun 530 = MG Hector and so on. I did not even look at the available options. My friends have it, they are okay with it. But that's me ! Nissan : Magnite was the obvious contender and this was the car I liked which made me consider the Kiger. Lookwise, I found Kiger to have sharper looks. That's subjective, of course. But Magnite has the advantages of hill descent and ESP. It lacks two curtain airbags though. And then again the wait time. I have friends who have been waiting for the Magnite for 8+ months. Renault : Kiger it is but I would have LOVED to have considered the Duster too. No availability now. I presume the new one is on card. It's one amazing vehicle. I have a friend who sold a Duster to buy another. This time, the AWD. I did not consider the Triber cause an MPV is not what we were looking for. Skoda : Another brand I would prefer to stay away from, unless amazed by some option. Primarily because of the service issues and expensive spares. Not sure if things have changed now but that's my blocked mind. Tata : Nexon would have been considered but for AMT. Altroz DCA had a long wait again. And again, no more hatchback after driving the Kiger. Toyota : We could have considered the Glanza but this has a wait time of 1 month plus and again a hatch. Volkswagen : Polo. This was another strong contender but we opted out due to long wait period and again, a hatch ! It might not have been a Kiger if we had time. It could have been as well. But since she had already sold her car, having a car soon was a strong criteria. Not at the cost of a collapse though and I definitely do not feel like we compromised on the Kiger as even if we had to wait, we could have still gone for the Kiger. The Sonet and the Venue were strong contenders, but for the further price difference and the wait.", 20th April 2022,renault-kiger,Bangalore,522,"1,717"
3, abhisheksircar , 12:04 ,BHPian,"The sales experience began with my call to the Renault Dealer, JP Nagar branch. It was cordially attended by a saleswoman who in turn handed over the call to Nanda Kumar, who has been my SPoC for this whole purchase experience. He has always been available to attend to my queries. Renault works in a way that all the dealers in Bangalore is owned by one entity and hence if I reach out to him first, it's his deal, even if I go to any other outlet to close it. He kept asking me, did you call anyone else before, did anyone call you before etc. Reason, if they did, irrespective of who closes the deal, the one who initiated gets the credit. In my case, it's been just one SPoC. With this one dealer in one major town, the pricing is also quite controlled and it seems to be driven by Renault very closely. Dealers/outlets, do not pit against each other. Every accessory or freebee is accounted for. As I mentioned elsewhere that Nanda drove down with a 2021 RXZ and once we were okay, he took us to the closest outlet which was in Sarjapur to complete the formalities of booking. We paid a booking amount which is mostly returned, in case of a cancellation which is usually the administration charge but if I heard it right, it was around 1000 INR. I did not bother paying much attention to it as we were going ahead with it. After paying the booking amount, we were given a docket which had the receipt for the booking amount, accessories list, renault finance options, details about easyCare, extended warranty and contact details for Customer Care Manager. This car has got almost everything but there is always scope to accessorize and I was soon contacted by Vivek with the accessory details and I picked up very basic things. There is lots going out there. I was asked for 3M Paint Protection etc which I had denied cause I had other plans. PDI I had re-iterated multiple times to make sure that the registration process is not initiated before PDI is done. Once registration is done, there is not much that can be done. One way to control is to release payment only after PDI is done. My Sales Rep said that it's not usual but he did not fuss a bit to arrange for it. The car was called into the Silkboard showroom as the trucks are not allowed till the Sarjapur center. We went in there and there was the car, our first glance and connect with a new family member ! As always, the PDI list was kept handy, so was the VIN decoder (ARTICLE: Find your car's date of manufacture (VIN)). As was shared earlier, this was indeed a March 2022 (N3) vehicle and there is not too much doubt on this one as this version was launched in Mar2022 only. We looked all around, started her for the first time and she spoke ! It was 14kms on the dash. We also checked if the infamous mud from the tail light issue and it's probable fix was in place and there it was. So in the 2022 version they now have a fixture to avoid that. Though I would have really liked a complete fender lining hiding the exposed parts. What I find it difficult to notice is if a panel has been ""fixed"" and for that I called in a friend and a detailer (Shrey). He came in and had a look too and we were good to go. The car was over waxed to make it all shiny and hence it was requested to wash all that off to keep it natural. There was some minor panel gaps noticed which was highlighted which they would look into it before delivery. My son was Critical when he was much younger and he was critical this time too. He loves this PDI experience. A good PDI needs to end with a good lunch and it was Sushi this time. The Delivery The whole sales and delivery experience has been pretty good and I am quite happy. There was a day delay since most of the technicians were off after a long weekend holiday and hence the accessories were not installed but they have been profusely apologetic on it and I was absolutely okay with it as there was no rush to sabotage a festive occasion. The day of delivery, we had to get the car rolling within 1030 hrs to follow the preferred time. We got an automated SMS the previous day confirming the scheduled delivery time and location. In the morning, the sales representative, Nanda messaged us keeping us informed about the progress. We were on time and so where they. We reached in a time when the team huddle was going on and it was quite elaborate. Pledge, Commitment song, National anthem followed by a motivation and functional speech by an internal trainer/employee. It was evident that the company was quite structured and organized. Soon after the huddle, they got busy with our delivery process. The car finally came in with all accessories in place and since they had to drive the last stretch as trucks were not allowed, it was 28 kms on the dashboard which is quite acceptable. A final check was done all around to ensure that things were kept as is from the time the PDi was done to the delivery time. The accessories were checked and we were good to go. The car looked beautiful in the blue. They did a Puja of the car within the showroom before the first drive after handover. It was done with love by an employee again. The whole team gathered around to support the occasion. A series of exchanges were done, which included the dummy big key, a delighted customer board, chocolates from us and the final key of the car. Finally she took the key and started the car to move it a bit ahead as a closure of a car delivered. And then there was the flag off. This was massive. I have never seen a delivery like this. The whole team came outside and formed two rows around the car and there was a flag off with everyone cheering the drive off from the showroom. It was quite overwhelming. This is from Trident Renault, Sarjapura although my sales representative was from the JP Nagar branch and he left him home before 0800 hrs in the morning to make everything ready on time. https://youtu.be/78vK5Kuvwzs The car is for later but the delivery sure felt like picking up more than a million rupee car ! Till now, the impression of Renault India has been wonderful or should I say, Trident Renault has been wonderful. I must make a mention of Cluster Head Dileep, who has been also quite supportive. There is just one thing which I did not like and I confirmed with friends having cars from other manufacturer dealers and they all have the same issue. To push a insurance of their choice which is expensive and need not be the best. I still went for it to have a peace of mind. The Blessings I had to rush out after the delivery to a weekend engagement and hence we just parked the car for 3 days at home. In came Monday and the first thing we did was to head to the temple for the blessings from Lord Ganesha. This one is in HSR layout and that's where all our vehicles end up for blessings. The pandit was jolly good and we had a quick ceremony for a complete blessing of the car to be part of the family and be safe and keep us safe for years to come.", 20th April 2022,renault-kiger,Bangalore,522,"1,717"
4, abhisheksircar , 12:06 ,BHPian,"Renault Kiger is one looker !! There are cars which look great but fail to look good in certain angles. The Indian and the French engineers have done a tremendous job to make it absolutely good looking. The muscular flexes all over the car, the sleek DRLs, the standing out tri LED setup, the bold Renault login, the diamond cut alloys, the funky rear light setup, the split spoiler, everything just comes together really well. Yes, it does have it's resemblance to the smaller Kwid, specially for the lower variants which does not have the Tri LED setup but that's not a bad thing. It still looks great. Renault Kiger falls in the Sub 4 meter Compact SUV segment competing with Nexon, Sonet, Venue, Brezza, XUV300 and the likes. What's new in 2022 (RXZ Turbo CVT variant) - Front Skid Plate - Turbo badging on the doors - Red logo on the alloys - Chrome strip on the trunk door Kiger probably looks the best from the front with it's bold design elements supported by the sleek DRLs with integrated indicators and the triLED setup. The sculpted bonnet and the skid plate adds up. It's quite commanding for it's segment. The Renault Kiger has a pretty good ground clearance at 205 mm which is quite similar to it's competition. The front 3-quarter also looks quite good with the muscular wheel arcs, roof lines and the prominent Turbo door badging. The rear 3-quarter is no less with the funky tail light design which jets out from the body giving it a very smart crease lines. The rear split spoiler sure does add up. From the rear also, it really flexes out and has some very neat lines along. I didnt' stop looking at it even from the top. The lines of this car are just perfect. The split spoiler and the ridges on the roof looks really good. The front facia is busy and yet composed. The loud Renault logo makes it's presence announced. The DRL and Indicators are very nicely integrated in a neat unit. I absolutely love the TriLED setup. There is no fog lamp and the claim is that with the placement of the LEDs, there is no need for a fog lamp. Low beam activates the outer two, while the high beam activates the innermost LED. The skid plate adds up to the SUV feel The rear light almost looks like a concept. It includes not only the shape but also the 3D element to it which looks really funky with the C Type setup. The badges of xtronic, Turbo and Kiger are subtly styled in. A huge chrome strip adorns the setup. The Kiger rides on MRF Wanderer EcoTreds which is a 195/60 R16 wrapped around diamond cut alloy wheels. The whole setup looks and feels quite good. The RXZ badging is in the front 3 quarter fender. The turbo badging on the door could be handled differently but it's not bad either. I like the way the claddings give way to the jack mounts. The rear comes in together really well with the split spoiler, shark fin antennae, roof rails and a neatly tucked in washer for the rear wiper. The front wiper is supported by one unit of washer which sprays in 3 different locations. Center, Left and Right. First time of the day and the wiper comes on first before the water is sprinkled which I do not like. One of my favorites on how the rear camera is integrated within the renault logo The engine bay is busy but has enough space to plonk in a 1.6 as well. There is insulation provided. The fuel cap is the usual which is reasonably built. Not flimsy but not extremely well built too. Single exhaust unit with a metallic heat management panel around it. The under body is well coated. Not 90 degree, but the doors open wide enough for easy ingress or egress. I love the keys. It's sleek and just slips in to your pocket. I would be worried to drop it though as it has plastics all around. I ordered a key cover from Amazon. The tail lights look stylish from behind with the C setup and lights up well with braking. With the TriLED setup, I was expecting the headlight to shine out well and it did. I took the car to a dead zone with no lights at all, and this was the result. Quite nice. It still does not make rain driving easy in the night but I have not found a car with good headlights to make me comfortable in that aspect. The pics were taken with the right settings to give the exact feel of how it looks in real. The Kiger among the Tiger family as an easter egg in the rear glass panel Now few things that I did not like in the exterior. Why Renault why ?? Take few thousands more from me and get me a nice fender lining which does not make the car look like I stole it mid production cycle or the fender lining just fell off. Atleast in the 2022, they have provided an extra layer of protection around the rear mudguards for the mud to not seep into the headlight unit, but still. Why Renault Why ??? It's like every story has to have a catch. For Renault, it's an easy fix and I hope it comes out soon and is backward compatible. This is more than a million rupee on road. This is not the kind of finish expected. I checked in other Kigers and while most places it's fine, it's this unit which really stands out", 20th April 2022,renault-kiger,Bangalore,522,"1,717"
5, abhisheksircar , 12:11 ,BHPian,"They say there is no perfect car and this is no exception. While the engine, gearbox, body and styling fared quite well, it's the interiors which took the hit in terms of cost cutting which is quite evident. Can I live with it ? For sure. Am I wowed as I was with the exterior design ? For sure not. What's new in 2022 (RXZ Turbo CVT variant) 1. Red stitches on the seat 2. Cruise control 3. Wireless charger 4. Red graded shade on the dash As soon as you sit in the driver seat, you realize that this compact SUV makes you feel one segment higher. The seating could match up with the next segment SUVs. The flat bottom steering looks good and is quite functional. The raised ICE Unit is quite easy to navigate. First look definitely goes to an almost waterfall central console which looks quite nice. You might then notice the huge mirror on the A pillar blocking a good section of the view. The next thing you notice is the plastics. It's not bad but not one you would expect in a car of this segment. Soft plastic is almost like a given these days. There is play of Piano black material here and there which looks good. Piano black needs attention though. The rearview mirror is a bit flimsy and allows very narrow view through the rear window. The headrests add to the ineffectiveness. I personally did not have an issue with this yet. It's manageable. Dimming is manual and not automatic. The upholstery is fabric here as it needs to work effectively with the side airbag units. Yes, the kiger has 4 airbags. I like the red stitching on the seats. The seats allow height and incline adjustments. The ignition block in the steering column looks quite odd and empty and I would have preferred the ignition switch to be on the steering column instead of the center console. The plastics overall does not feel like a million rupee car. It's scratchy and not soft. There is a nice gradient treatment on the front dash with a piano finish which breaks the monotony of Piano black everywhere. I like the flat bottomed steering. It has a short patch of leather on the top. I plan to place a full leather cover on it soon. The steering is slightly on the heavier side in a good way making the handling quite nice. It's a pleasure in curvy roads. The steering has all the required controls, including the cruise control buttons. No qualms over here. You can adjust it for height but not reach. The stocks are aligned to the Indian standards with washer based controls on the left and light based controls like indicator, high beam switches on the right stock. The rear seats have plenty of space. There are two adjustable headrests which come on the rear seat. There are map holders in the back of the front seat. There is a center armrest which allows you to place some cups and a phone but the cup holders are very shallow. The rear doors hold 4 speakers, just like the front adding up to a 8 speaker system. All the doors can also hold one liter bottles. Kiger has storage sorted for sure. It's everywhere. The rear seats support ISOFIX seats. The boot allows a massive 405 litres of storage space which is quite good for a compact SUV. The seats allow a split fold allowing to extend the storage space to the rear passenger seat. The loading lip is quite high making handling luggage a bit cumbersome; only if the luggage is too heavy. The center panel with the armrest looks and is quite functional. It has a sliding unit for storage extended with a reasonably well placed armrest which locks itself with a strong magnet. It's quite big and is recommended with a storage organizer to manage it well. But that huge storage in the center seems like an after thought as while putting it, they tucked the seat belt lock cramped way between the seats and the central unit. I still struggle to locate and put the seat belt. I hope to master this soon The front and rear doors have capacity to hold 1 liter bottles. It has piano insets to add to the aesthetics. Each door hosts a speaker and a tweeter. The rear door supports childlock. There are 2 glove boxes on the front passenger side. It's got ample storage space. The lower one is a cooled glove. The front driver door provides controls for the power windows, adjusting the mirrors and closing the mirror units. Only the front driver side window supports auto up and down. The rear window does not open completely and stops with few inches to go. The ergonomics of using either of these power window switches in every door is not that great and you have to bend your hand a bit back to use it. We are spoilt these days !! PM2.5 air filter in all AC units is very thoughtful in these times which is almost like wearing a mask around the car to avoid even very fine dust and germs to an extent. The AC controls along with other controls are pretty nicely placed. I like the LED driven indicators inside the knobs. The AC is adequately effective although Bangalore is going through a weather patch which is comparable to any hill stations. Peak summers, next year or some drive outside will give a better picture. One thing I do not like is having to switch off the blower manually every time to off before switching off the car to avoid the car starting next time with the blower on. This should have automatically gone to 0 when switching off the car. The switches above it has blowers for the front glasses, hazard light indicator and central door lock and unlock buttons. There are 2 buttons still empty and this is where I could have liked the cruise control on and off button to be in instead of placing it in a central unit. It has a phone/key/wallet etc storage unit under these switches. The unit just below it hosts a USB port, start/stop ignition button and the cruise control activation button. Under that is the wireless charger. This supports fast wireless charging. The phone gets a bit hot though over time. There is a dedicated button to switch on and off the charger. There is a dedicated button alongside it for ambient light as well. Next to it is a mode selector helping you to toggle between Eco, Normal and Turbo mode. The ICE unit is pretty decent and nothing extra ordinary here. What I like is it's high placement. I also like the other controls like AC temperature change etc also being displayed on top of the system so that the driver does not have to look down. This supports both Android Auto and Apple Carplay. The resolution is not that great though. The rear camera in low light conditions is not well supported by the reverse light to make it almost unusable with it's own light. This system is support by an 8 system ARKAMYS speaker system which is quite decent. It's clear although lacks depth. It's nowhere comparable to the Tata JBL systems. I like systems which can let me hear the depth while in low volume. This one does not. I might have to consider a bass unit although I'll prefer to keep it stock. Something that I like in my Ciaz is the music pausing when I hit the mute button. Not the same here. Although just twice, but the unit got stuck on the reverse screen even though we were moving forward. Will keep a watch. The AC units in the rear helps and it also has a 12W charging point. While the rear AC vents can be switched off, none of the front AC units can be closed. For the front vents, you can only change the direction away from you, if needed. The reading lights look outdated for a car which looks so modern from outside. Only the passenger blind gets a mirror although no cover to close the mirror if needed. The mic is placed right above the driver seat and clarity is quite good. There is a temperature sensor just next to the front reading light to work with the Auto unit of the AC. The instrument console is completely digital. I like the analog clock impression in there. It has all the basic information although I am so used to see a Tacho that it's missed here although I am not sure how useful it is in an automatic which does not even have a semi-manual mode. The door open indicator shows every door individually. The seat belt alert is for both driver and passenger. On not wearing the seatbelt, the ICE unit goes muted and only the beeps are audible. As you can see, The car currently shows a mileage of 8.6 km/ltr but this is the average considering that it was 3.4 km/ltr when I received the car. In general when I am driving, I see it gives a real time mileage between 12-18 km/ltr. I have a feeling that over the time, it will average out at around 12-14 km/ltr which is good enough. The visuals in the night is like a cockpit with all the switches support by backlit lights. The ambient lights are in the doors and the central console. A big omission is the gear indicators glowing in the night. This should have really been there. The inner door beads have a velvetty texture to it instead of the usual rubber. I do not know the long term durability of it yet and why is it different from the usual plain rubber. It feels good though. These locks are from the 80s and again one more thing that does not suit this otherwise well designed car from outside. The break pedals are right off the manual instead of adapting to the automatic by providing a broader paddle. Personally I did not have an issue in this although a broader one is more convinient. In the interior, the Why Renault Why moment is with the exposed nuts here and there. These sure deserve a cap or something. Renault sure loves to flaunt it's engineering !", 20th April 2022,renault-kiger,Bangalore,522,"1,717"
6, abhisheksircar , 12:13 ,BHPian," I was surprised by the finesse of the gear box when I drove the Magnite for the first time and this translated to the Kiger as well. I did not drive the Magnite for long but with the Kiger it's now around 250 kms and I am quite impressed The Feel Factor : The car feels and behaves like a segment higher. It's does not restrict itself to be like a compact SUV. The sitting posture, the space available is quite good. The Engine : 1.0 Turbo producing about 100 bhp, this engine does not feel stressed while in the highway or overtaking. Although I definitely feel that there is a turbo lag in lower RPMs. Once you are past that, it's a breeze with this engine just cruising away, literally !! The Gearbox : This CVT box mated to a 1.0 turbo is a beauty. Not once in this 450 kms did I feel the gear shifts. It's not different from any other car having CVT but someone coming from the AMT lineage is pleasantly surprised. I had read somewhere that it's just a fuss of the CVT over the AMT, it's not. CVT is much more refined although not a new breakthrough technology. The Suspension : I personally love this bit. It takes in bad roads pretty nicely and has a very well balanced suspension setup. It definitely has learnt from the duster. I have compared similar patches of road in different vehicles ranging from Sedans, to hatchbacks, to compact SUVs and even full grown SUVs. The Kiger holds quite well. The Tyres : MRF Wanderer Ecotred holds pretty well and feels like having the right specifications for the Kiger. Along with the suspensions, it behaves quite well on the road. No complains here although there is no long drive done on this yet. I'll update if I have some constructive feedback. The Steering : The steering is slightly on the heavy side and that's good. There is connect to the car and the car holds to the lines quite well. Cruise Control : This is my first car with the cruise control functionality and I'll be honest, its scary at the beginning with the car at 80 km/hr speed with your legs off the accelerator but after you get used to it, it's just a bliss with your focus only on the steering. It's really a bliss on the highways. You can cancel it as soon as there is a slight touch on the break or even by hitting the cancel button on the steering. Once back on track, you can press the +/- to get it to your desired speed and the vehicle will get to the speed and stay there without any manual intervention. The Turbo mode is fun to drive in although it does not really add some extra boost or bhp to the engine, it's purely electronic with the throttle and steering response becoming much more sensitive. Leaving aside the technicalities, it's fun. The Eco mode is almost not drive-able or at least, that's how I feel. I mostly have been driving this in the Normal mode. I rarely use the Turbo mode. The rare few has been during some overtakes in the highway or when I just wanted to have some fun. In general, the Kiger behaves quite matured for a compact SUV and is quite composed and fun to drive.", 20th April 2022,renault-kiger,Bangalore,522,"1,717"
7, abhisheksircar , 12:15 ,BHPian,"We have been buying from the Suzuki garage from almost 2 Decades now. Although the cars cannot be called the best of the lot, what it really makes up for it is the bend your back approach to keep your customer happy. Be it sales or service. We were going to continue this, but for the delay. Renault as a brand is what I appreciate for the awesome product they have, the Duster. That is a tank with literally bullet proof features all across. It's a rally car with bullet proof engine on the road ! Beyond this, it's unknown territory for us. Service : This is a big question mark for us and we really hope it goes smooth. There are quite a few stories out there with issues but most of them said the same thing, they tried their best but the vehicle itself has design issues. I'll keep this thread updated and hope to have no sour surprises. I asked the sales team to connect me with the best team in Bangalore irrespective of the distance. The recommendation was Silk Board Renault Service center. Cost of spares : I have been told that unlike the other cars, this car was developed in India with a lot of local sourcing and hence the cost of spares will be quite reasonable. This is something that I have not verified and this will remain an unknown to me for now. Resale : This is another big unknown as Renault cars are not known to fetch a good price. That said, we are accepting this as we keep our cars in quite good condition and for long. Issues : Kiger was build for India, in India and is just a 1+ year old car. There are definitely unknowns in the long term and I am hoping to see no bad surprises.", 20th April 2022,renault-kiger,Bangalore,522,"1,717"

9, abhisheksircar , 13:46 ,BHPian,"I have captured a bit of perspective with some different cars to relate to. Magnite This is the most common comparison as under that skin, it's the same car. Magnite was the car that I drove while waiting for the Baleno which made me consider the Kiger. The Differences 1. Exterior Looks : This is very subjective and while one might like the Magnite, the other might be inclined towards the Kiger. For me, the Kiger looks amazing from any angle. Even from the top but Magnite falls a bit weak if seen from the front. The rear in the Magnite looks matured. 2. Interior : With the dual tone interior, the Magnite looks better and feels better quality than the Kiger but the Kiger scores on the central console layout with the central armrest setup. 3. Features : While Kiger has 4 airbags, compared to the Magnite having 2; the Magnite makes up for Hill Descent Control and ESP. Duster A quick perspective with it's elder brother, The mighty Duster. That's one SUV I really like for it's handling. The Kiger stands quite nicely next to it. The Kiger surely seemed to have learnt a bit from the Duster for it's drive-ability. I hope they get the Duster back with better interiors. Ciaz A car very often seen on the road and hence an easy perspective comparison. A 2015 Ciaz and a 2022 Kiger. Yes the Ciaz looks dated, but is holding quite good elegantly. The Kiger has quite a presence even in front of a full size Sedan. One last fun perspective with a legend ", 20th April 2022,renault-kiger,Bangalore,522,"1,717"
10, abhisheksircar , 19:00 ,BHPian,"Today Renault Kiger accounts to about 3% of the total C1 segment sales which is the hottest segment in India. That's way too less than what this car deserves. Indians definitely have this major herd mentality and that's one of the strong reason. The unknown future is another. Leaving that aside, I feel Renault has a winner in it's hand which needs people to just test drive it to close the deal. One of my friend was not so restricted with time and has been taking his own sweet time to test all possible cars to chose his next car. His final two include the Kiger. Is it the best car available today ? No. But it surely is the best value for money. I do not want to name and offend owners of few C1 segment cars which are selling way more than the Kiger although are way more inferior to the Kiger in many ways. Kiger has a good safety rating. Renault extends trust towards it's car with provisions like Extended warranty (Warranty till 5 years) and EasyCare (Service taken care for 3 years/30k kms for a meager 15k INR which includes all consumables like engine oil, oilfilter, etc). Renault almost created a segment of it's own with the Duster. It was an amazing SUV which is fun to drive, has a very good suspension setup and can manage most kinds of roads. Kiger is no different in this aspect and is fun to drive with a good suspension setup which is quite well balanced. A slightly heavy steering which holds it's line is also something that I quite like. Unfortunately Kiger also takes the genes of Renault making great cars with not much interest in great interiors. I am in no way saying that the interior is bad but with subtle changes and attention to details this shortcoming in the interiors can be also overcome. My 7 year old Ciaz has interiors that are more attended to than a car that was developed from the scratch just last year. 1. Make the plastics better 2. Place the switches in a better way 3. Stop flaunting your engineering and cover it That's it !! Renault has sorted the difficult part. A car that is good to drive and what's pending is very achievable if there is a desire to correct it. They did not feel the need in the Duster and I doubt they will work further towards it in the Kiger also although these are not major changes. I really would not mind a simpler analogue instrument cluster in lieu of attending to the other smaller bits. Renault has committed itself to develop cars specific to the Indian market with the Indian engineers along with French engineers to be sold in India and exported from India to the world. I hope the Indian market responds positively to this commitment. It's definitely a turn around for Renault with the Kiger and Triber with Renault today selling almost as many vehicles as the Honda and more than the Skoda, VW, MG, Jeep etc. It's a perfect time to get back the new Duster to regain it's brand presence. I can say without any hitch that the Renault Kiger is a grossly underrated car in India which hopefully gets it's due recognition over time.", 15th May 2022,renault-kiger,Bangalore,522,"1,717"
11, abhisheksircar , 19:01 ,BHPian,"The car was done with all required accessories and it was now time to protect the paint and do some design changes. 1. PPF on necessary places. Front Bumper, Headlights, Door Edges and Door Handles 2. Ceramic on the rest of the painted surface 3. Black wrap on the roof 4. Carbon fiber wrap on the mirrors 5. Almost blacked out the chrome with a bit of chrome hints left I decided to trust Guy Car Steamer, Shrey with these requirements. He is honest with his suggestions and hence it's easy to work with him. After trying a lot to convince him to put PPF on the bonnet too, he did not agree and decided to go for a more reasonable ceramic. That's Shrey ! The car was left there was 3 days. I would go everyday to have a quick look on what's happening to decide on some on the spot decisions. Everything went quite well and I am really happy with the final outcome. This place is always busy and it's recommended to take an appointment and go there. As soon as I entered the second day, my focus was all on the CBRs parked there.

Black wrap for the roof and the split spoilers. It's not glossy and hence gives a very smart look. Very good application making it look like OEM as well.

Alas majority of Indians still ask the neighbour Maruti uncle for suggestion. One thing I can say about Renault or french manufacturers in general, is that they always have a surprise factor. Kwid was a brilliant product for the time, we all know Duster and Triber is just a magic. I did not expect that much space to be honest. I thought they were selling a namesake 7 seater. But for city usage it's good. The gearing is short, so much so that my 84 HP Tiago feels slow infront of 71 HP Triber. But Triber struggles at top end. It badly needs the turbo.

Glad you liked the review. 1. The puddle lamp unit goes inside the door padding but there is small incision that's done to keep the projector lens out. 2. This is my first CVT so I do not know what a rubberband effect is, but that said, there is no jerk, no feel of gear changes. I have done highways, gradient slopes, crawling traffic and normal city traffic. The only bit is when you just start rolling, there is a slight lag. 3. Better than a black or a dark brown but it will not be as easy as a white or a steel grey shade. I did a complete ceramic coating and PPF in critical areas for some help to maintain.

You have chosen the best option- that of the CVT rather than my jerky, slightly asthmatic version. Heres wishing you many happy miles! One major irritating issue to watch out for (and no - Im not referring to the mud/splashing issue at the rear end) is the extremely audible brake squeal - a daily affair at crawling speed when one slowly applies brakes. Ive been a victim, and I understand from the service centre here that it is a common problem - something to do with a design flaw in the pads by their supplier. They changed my brake pads (after 4500 kms) and put on those from another supplier (I think it is called Nano) but as predicted by the technician (privately) the issue persists.", 21st May 2022,renault-kiger,cochin,"1,277","1,227"

Thank you Quote: Originally Posted by livetodrive But sadly couldn't acquire it because of handling charges imposed by Renault. Recently I heard they have stopped charging this component. Is it true? That's true. Handling charges are not imposed by any dealer now. I think there was a court ruling against it somewhere. That said, dealers always find a way to make that little extra. It's insurance these days. Quote: Originally Posted by livetodrive Did you opt for extended warranty? If you can share on road price with components it will be helpful Few points to note in this. 1. You can always take a different insurance. What was offered and I took it just for peace of mind, although was quite expensive was a 3 years insurance where the 2nd and 3rd year is just 3rd party. So I have to renew again next year for comprehensive. That said, the dealer showed me instances where Renault has provided 60% discount on the renewal making this 50k come down to 16 or so. I'll keep the thread updated. 2. Extended warranty now keeps the car under warranty till 2027. 3. EasyCare sounds too good to be true and I really need to see the catch. By paying around 15k, I have no further expenses on service for the next 3 years. Consumables are also covered. Wear and Tear is on me. Rest is all covered. I presume other manufacturers are also provided similar options these days. 4. We had got a corporate discount. 5. Standard accessories include mudflaps, mat, car over etc which you can opt out for as well or selectively go for what you want. 6. Fast tag, you get Rs.150/- of recharge after paying 500. Rest is administrative charges 7. I had opted for additional accessories which gets added in the price. Quote: Originally Posted by livetodrive How about the ingress egress in rear bench Abhishek? Do you recommend for elders? For elders, this is better than the sedans where you have to sit down a bit. This is a straight walk in and out. More convenient for elders although height also plays a factor. Around 5'2""+ should be fine. My Renault App We were introduced to the My Renault app by our sales representative, Nanda. These days almost all manufacturers have this and it's quite convenient.

Do you have to use the hand brake and accelerator method ? I usually drive manuals and sometimes drove the previous Celerio AMT in the last 7 years which was barebone. Never had an issue as such. Flyovers and all is no issue at all. In general when you are in D, the car is willing to go ahead in most inclines (Parking ramps, flyover etc) even without engaging the accelerator, just pressing the brakes is enough to stop from moving ahead and leaving the brakes makes it move. These automatics in general are not a free roll backwards in Drive mode but in steep inclines it could be a botheration but in my last 500 kms of driving the Kiger with some sporadic inclines, there was no issue at all and never faced the lack of of Hill Hold.

We have a Kiger CVT in our group and its a no-nonsense car. To begin with when my friend was looking at a replacement of his Grand i10 AT, this was never a probable. Later while exploring the available options, we stumbled upon this and boy, this hits all the right notes for the segment. One of the missing features was the hill descent support, I can safely say that the car has a good grip and doesnt roll back on slopes or hills. Its creeps / stalls when at an elevated position and this is without the brakes/accelerator. I believe the mild default set acceleration at the drive mode helps to maintain the climb. Like its rightly mentioned here, except for the Interior Quality & Fit and Finish in a few areas this eats the cake be it the space (Rear/Boot/Storage) or the engine gearbox combination (Turbo CVT), Fuel efficiency etc. Looks being subjective, the pricing used to be super attractive too.

34, abhisheksircar , 16:57 ,BHPian,"1800 kms and 2 months, we are absolutely loving the upgrade from the Celerio. Observations - The car continues to drive really well and that's it's strength. The suspension, the CVT gearbox. Continuous assurance of being a 4* rated car. - It continues to be a looker. 3 people in my known circle have booked the Kiger. People have come forward to ask me as to how's the car like. - We have got an average mileage of 11.3 kms/ltr over the first 1800 kms which is primarily in the city, AC always on. - The AC is not a bone chiller but does its work and is loud at max blower. With my requirement of 24 approx, the blower stays at 2 notches in Bangalore weather. I have now got used to the small niggles like the seat belt position etc. Considering the roads in Bangalore, I have been taking the Kiger out more than my Ciaz these days. It's much for comfortable to ride over the potholes and bumpy roads. Purpose served. Issues. - As someone had reported, yes, the brakes do have some sound on cold start and in slow speeds. - I finally faced the much spoken about rubber band effect in a CVT but it's very subtle. The CVT gear box is a charm. - I would have loved the blower to go to 0 every time the car is switched off instead of starting with the car where last left. So my sequence of stopping a car is, Stop AC, Get blower to 0, Switch off car, Unlock car from the central dash. - The rear parcel shelf jumps a bit to make some noise but that's subdued with the music system which is always on - The engine is not the most silent and has a humming noise from the 3 pots. It's not loud and all but it's evident. Now the service This was a big concern for me as it's almost like a new territory for me after being pampered by Suzuki service for 2 decades. I was suggested to take the car to Mysore service center which is headed by Santosh. Now Mysore service center is 53 kms from my place if I take the NICE road but for things like service, I usually do not bother about distance. The closest Renault service center is just about 10 kms from my place. So the first service is within 2 months or 2000 kms, whichever comes first. I went right on time to be hosted by Santosh who was nice to have stepped out to greet me. I was introduced to Nishank, who is one of the service advisors there. 3 of us and one more engineer took the car for a test drive. There is a defined route which includes good and bad roads. It's actually a good track to test every possible issue. This service was supposed to be a general checkup and hence mostly quoted as a ""Wash the Car"" service but they all took time to understand any anomalies. The tyre pressure was on the higher side, the mats were not best suited for the pedals and engine bay is being visited by rats as there were paw marks. They didn't miss anything ! Although the brake issue was not replicated, they took a note of that too. Santosh has more than 2 decades of experience with brands like Suzuki, Porsche, Audi etc. He understands cars. I also noticed that he is quite serious when he is taking the test drive asking his team to take notes of the observations he was making while driving. It's not just a joy ride. I expected the service to be just a wash and out but it took a good 4 hours as they cleaned up the brake pads, just to be sure and attended to any concerns I had like a rattling sound on one of the panels which was narrowed down to a loose bolt which could be a result of the accessories installed where the panels were removed, like the puddle lamps. Presumption. Nishank kept sending me pictures of the progress on whatsapp which made me comfortable. There was a software update too which took a while and no one can do anything on the car when that's going on. The first service costed me about 360/- INR which included washer fluid, grease, brake clean etc. From the next 1 year service, it should be ideally 0 because of the easy care I have which covers everything is what I understood. I paid a bit extra for a 3M rodent repellent spray treatment as well. If I had to nitpick, I would say it was me missing the NEXA experience of sitting in a nice lounge and seeing my car getting serviced through a large glass window. This service lounge and setup is at par with the Suzuki Arena setup or any other general service setup with availability of wifi, tea/coffee and a sitting area equipped with sofas. In short, it was a big sigh of relief to know that it's hopefully going to be a smooth sail from here on.", 8th July 2022,renault-kiger,Bangalore,522,"1,717"

36, sid_sawhney , 18:14 ,Newbie,"Congratulations on your Kiger, Abhishek! I'm glad you had such a good experience. I bought the Kiger RXZ CVT earlier this year as well. My experience has also generally been good with the car. Unfortunately, my service experience has been rather poor. I've gotten my car serviced at Renault Yelahanka. For the first service I also had issues regarding the brake noise and the brake feeling rather heavy during start stop traffic. Since I had some work I left my car at the service centre and had to come back home. The service centre team said that since their technician isn't available on a Sunday, the car would be available on a Monday only. Being a working day, I asked them to have the car dropped off. I was asked to pay a sum of 250rs for drop off(which I wasn't aware is common practice) but obliged anyway. When the car was handed over, I noticed a strange mark on my right DRL. I immediately told the driver and called up the service executive. He said that sometimes there is moisture which will go in a few hours. I was unconvinced and also taken aback by the headlight fogging up by a little water but agreed to monitor it anyway. Over the next couple of days, it was confirmed that it wasn't moisture but a stain on the headlight which wouldn't go even after attempting to clean properly. I complained again and was asked to bring in the car. In addition I also noticed that the pulse action for windshield jet wasn't working. It was annoying that my car actually came back with issues after the first service. Unfortunately, I was supposed to shift cities and had to again get my car picked up and dropped for this repair. The service center gave me extremely unconvincing answers to the problems such as the wiper wasn't working because the nozzle gets jammed due to dust in the nozzle. How does the dust enter you'd ask? Because the water used is impure! Similarly for the headlight stain, the service executive stayed that some AC water must have fallen because I had parked the car wrongly somewhere. They also discovered the DRL had cracked underneath the stain. After I sternly subverted his various attempts to place the blame on me, he finally gave in and said that they will replace the headlight under warranty. It was also uncovered that on bith occasions the Service representative hadn't inspected my car before clearing it for delivery. Just these couple of incidents have made me lost so much confidence in Renault service that now I'm partially regretting going with Renault. Now that I have moved out of Bangalore I'm hoping the service centres here in Hyderabad are better.", 11th July 2022,renault-kiger,Bengaluru,6,16

42, abhisheksircar , 10:51 ,BHPian,"Many reviews that I read of the Kiger kept mentioning that there is in-cabin noise that one needs to be aware of. I would agree as well as the 3 cylinders are not as quite. It hums. That said, it never bothered me enough to mention it as an issue but then I thought, let's measure it. I used a very basic setup of my Samsung S22 Ultra with an app called Decibel. I checked it in a sensitive place to start with, which is my home office room and the measure came to about 34 dB. This is a quiet room and good enough for silent client meetings as well. So it works, if it can catch that silence. I measured the noise levels in my Ciaz: • In idle it was around 52 dB • On the road, it went as high as 74 dB. And then the moment of truth, the Kiger: • It has similar readings, with idle was as low as 53 dB • Where as in roads it was about 75 dB (around 80 km/hr on tarmac, windows up, AC on) Both the cars were around 35 dB when the engine was off. Now, why do I not hear this much when I drive. I have this habit of listening to music when I drive and when I put on the music, it goes up to 77 dB which masks the engine or ambient noise. So this is how it stacks up. Image Source : https://hearinghealthfoundation.org/", 28th July 2022,renault-kiger,Bangalore,522,"1,717"

64, viny2k8 , 15:04 ,Newbie,"Hi everyone! Jumped onto Abhishek's review and sold my 14 year old long time Swift for a new Renault Kiger RXZ CVT Brown color in Aug 2022. Its just been about 45 days and about 2000 kms of running. The vehicle seems pretty decent to drive along, handles well, I felt the steering was a bit small in size and overall seems strictly built to a price with a few hard and sharp edges around. Sometimes difficult to digest the standards of INR 12+ Lakh cars these days and definitely not in the league of the Japanese, German, Indian or Korean counterparts. Couple of days back though, faced a horrible Petrol Leak after a short drive. The entire petrol tank was drained out onto the road and the vehicle wouldn't start. It was towed away to the service centre where the issue was 'simply' pinpointed to the pipe falling off loose. This is unbelievable for any vehicle as far as I know and have owned. We have taken serious note of this issue and trying to understand the root cause before taking back the vehicle. A small fire would have changed the scene totally. And such a situation at odd hours in a remote place may have made life difficult. This issue has really had everyone at home thinking whether we made the right decision to move away from a Maruti, Tata, Mahindra or Hyundai. Also, observed that the rear mud flaps have fallen loose within such a short time, speaks volumes about the quality of installed accessories as well as the installation job itself. All the quirks highlighted by other BHPians continue to be irritants but can't deny that the overall driving experience of the Turbo Engine+CVT is worth, rubberband effect aside the CVT irons out much of the jerks and non- linear power delivery smoother. Despite the incident though the overall Showroom experience and support has been trouble free so far and I hope can move proceed to have many happy years of motoring without major hiccups.

65, exec2063 , 13:21 ,Newbie,"1. My Kiger CVT Turbo was delivered to me in Ernakulam on Sep 3, as it was not available in Trivandrum. I returned to Trivandrum on Sep 5. On reaching, I found that the area below all the 4 doors was dirty due to road grime. When I reported this to the dealer and showed him the video, I was told that all cars have this problem, so thi is not unique to Kiger. In any case, they claimed to be aware of the problem, but did not have a solution. 2. On Sep 10, I drove back to Ernakulam from Trivandrum and was headed for the Kochi airport. About 10 kms from the airport, the car stopped and could not be moved. The dometer reading at this time was 529 kms. I found that the transmission fluid had leaked. We had to abandon the car there and it was later towed to the same dealer from where it was delivered. Being a Saturday, and Onam holidays were on, they were able to inspect the car only on Monday. In the meantime, I returned to Trivandrum in a taxi on Sunday. 3. I was told that a clamp for a hose was not fixed properly, and hence the hose had disconnected and the fluid had leaked. The car was brought back to the Trivandrum dealer on Wednesday, and I got it back on Thursday. 4. Roadside Assistance: It took 1.5 hours for them to get a cab to pick us up from the breakdown location and take us to a hotel. While I paid Rs 1300, I was told that Rs 1000 is the amount I would be reimbursed. Still waiting for that, although they claim it has been paid. 5. I paid Rs 11000 for the cab from Kochi airport to Trivandrum, still waiting for that reimbursement. In the meantime, I was asked whether I wanted to use the Rs 11000 towards extended warranty for 2 years beyond the 3 years I already had. I asked them to provide the extended warranty at no cost to me, for which they gave me some explanation that made no sense at all, so not done. 6. I still think the car is great, but I wonder whether I made a mistake since nobody at Renault or TVS seems to be responsible for the customer experience.", 6th October 2022,renault-kiger,Trivandrum,8,9

68, sandeep.devapur , 23:45 ,Newbie,"Just bought a new 2022 Renault Kiger Turbo CVT 1.0 - Took delivery yesterday (14-Oct-2022). Straight out I had issues getting the car started (even while at the showroom). So wanted to seek help here on this forum, if any of you have faced something similar. The car did not start (after being switched off) at: 1. The showroom itself (Took delivery from Renault-Yeshwantpur in Bangalore) 2. On the drive back to our home (Had to switch off the engine while waiting in traffic) 3. After I got home and parked it for about 1 hour. Each time I have seen different errors appear on the MID - ""Battery Charging Fault"", ""Check Auto Gear Box"", ""Check Anti-Pollution System"". When checking with the Service Center, what I was told is that I had left the smart key card on the wireless charging unit - which is what caused this issue. Now, I had left the key card on the wireless charger for maybe 10-15 minutes while we completed the delivery formalities. Would that really be the reason for this problem? To add on, I went to Renault-Yelahanka Service Center earlier today. They checked the car thoroughly (That's what they claim) and found no issue. They said both key card and battery are fully charged (I checked their claim and battery at least seems to be charged). I also tested the car - took it for a test drive and stopped the engine and and re-started. So far so good. NOTE: 1. The car comes only with a push-button start, so if it doesn't start with the push-button, there is practically no other way to start the car. 2. I did push down on the brake pedal to start the car (as instructed) and I pushed quite hard - the car did not start inspite of that.", 15th October 2022,renault-kiger,Bangalore,6,12

These definitely do not look or sound usual. There can't be so many different error messages for the key messing up. Please keep the thread updated about how's it progressing but that said, quite a heartbreaker experience. I have had few friends and family who have picked up and thankfully no major complains other than the following 1. Sound from the brakes in low speed. 2. Fuel Economy Brakes is something that I have also faced as I mentioned ealier but that's not as pronounced. Mileage is something that I also go hit with over time. Now I must say that recently Bangalore saw some crazy traffic and I myself drove though a stretch of 20 kms in 3 hrs. Now what I have started doing is using the Eco Mode. In stop go traffic like these, it's doable. Eco mode is very un-engaging to start with but once on the move, I realized, one can live with it consideirng the mileage benefits that one can get. It's not that it has been miracles since then but it's slowly, very slowly climbing up from 8. Yes, it had gone that low. Meanwhile, a friend who recently picked up has been driving in normal driving conditions has been getting around 14 and it's mostly because he has not see the dreadful traffic that I had to see multiple time. So in normal traffic and driving conditions 12+ is quite achievable. I am soon starting to sound like many Bangaloreans to whom if you talk about bad traffic, high cost of living, they have one thing so say, the weather is so nice. I keep repeating the same thing, the drivability is so nice with the gear shifts so smooth while we discuss issues ", 18th October 2022,renault-kiger,Bangalore,522,"1,717"

On a recent drive to the hills, I did try the L mode while going down hill. The car does hold the lower gears and it did simulate hill descent. If the incline is steep, you may have to use the brakes once a while. There was considerable difference with the L mode engaged. I would suggest that you use L mode on a down hill, especially where there are too many twists and turns.

I must say that this is an extremely well written review. I am not sure if there's an official Team BHP review of the Renault Kiger. When searching for one is when I stumbled upon this review of yours. Lovely colour and the wraps look amazing. I was looking for a Compact cross over.

78, Reppin_Frost , 11:48 ,Newbie,"I just got 2k+ kilometres on my Kiger RXZ CVT This 2k was a mix of both highway and city driving Few observations 1) after owning the car for close to 4 months now the cost cutting becomes more and more obvious. Some of them are just disappointing like uncovered screws/nuts on the door, the center panel gets scratches on it very very easily 2) You can indeed use the infotainment system while the ignition is off. Just have to turn on the nightime drls and you're good to go. THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED AND DO USE THE SYSTEM LIKE FOR A PROLONGED AMOUNT OF TIME. 3) Even after the first service the braking noise is still there. The Service Center Manager suggested leaving the car on Park without engaging the Hand Brakes but didn't help at all. At lower speeds the sound is still there. 4) Mileage is down horrendous, I am getting about 9kmpl in the city even without AC. I would like any advice fellow TBHP-ians on the matter because on of the reviews here the user was getting 9kmpl with AC on. 5) The car doesn't like potholes or bumps when your cross 35-40kmph. The suspension cries with a loud not so confidence inspiring ""Tung"" 6) Eco mode is pretty much only for stop and go traffic. It's simply so sluggish that it's impossible to drive on eco all the time. Noticed that when you floor the pedal while eco to move your car a little quicker the engine rings at a higher rpm for a longer duration than if you'd do it Normal mode 7) L mode is very help on Uphills and Downhills. 8) if you've the RXZ variant and have wireless charging phone do test it out. While wireless charging is on you get a very annoying chirping sound from close to the charger and this is on all RXZ Kigers(tested it on all cars at the service centre) and because of this the service centre simply said it's expected and it's probably indicator to show that your phone is charging Despite these I really do love driving the car and often take it for a small drive when I feel down.

Hello Piyush I was in the same dilemma as you, what helped me was that I did back to back test drives of Kiger and Punch and I suggest you do the same. I know Kiger's interior indicate cost cutting, but my observation about Punch is that it felt hollow, like something is missing and that something is a proper center console (optional arm-rest). Just sit in Punch and Altroz back to back (as they are in same showroom) you would also feel that Punch lacks something. Also, for me, difference in AMT vs CVT and NA vs Turbo was too big to think about interiors. I don't think there would be much difference between Tata and Renault After Sales Support as both have their fair share of horror stories.

It's been 2 months (Nov 6th) since I bought my Renault Kiger RXZ Turbo Xtronic CVT variant in a ravishing stealth black color scheme. Though I had done my research before buying it, I was skeptical about how the car would perform on long highway drives, over mountainous terrain and over broken countryside roads. But now that I have spent enough time on the road with the car and after having driven it for about 5000 kms, I wanted to share my honest opinion about this compact, but an extremely capable and underrated crossover SUV. The Options: I love to drive to the great outdoors. All this while I have been doing my trips in sedans and hatchbacks. But off late, I have been feeling the urge to own a car with good ground clearance, good power and torque figures to go places where I have been hesitant to go. I wanted a VFM car that's able to tackle bad roads, some cool features like drive sense modes, cruise control, a proper automatic, a turbo engine, wireless Andriod Auto and a higher driving position. I had shortlisted Renault Kiger RXZ Turbo CVT, Kia Sonet (HTX DCT) and the Brezza ZXI+ variant. Though Renault Kiger was my first love, the only deal breaker back in the day was lack of cruise control, bland interiors and the funky exterior colours. I went ahead with Kia Sonet in a black colour option. This was in the beginning of 2022 and the waiting period for the Sonet was just outrageous. After 6 months with the delivery not in sight, I booked the newly launched Brezza ZXI+. I expected the car to be delivered under 3 months based on what the Sales advisor said. Then came October, and the Service Advisor kept tossing me around with no car in sight (after 4 months). That's when I glanced back at Renault Kiger MY2022. The already attractive Kiger had become a better proposition with some smart updates in the mid of 2022. It now had cruise control, a smart looking interior with splashes of red and piano black, wireless charger, sporty upholstery and an amazing black colour option. 10 days later, I was owning one . The car buying experience was just great. I hardly did anything and the Sales Advisor kept his word. The bad bits Let's strike through the not so pleasant ones out first. - There are quite a few ergonomics related flaws which have been highlighted by multiple reviewers. The seat belt buckle (front seats) for one, the window switches on the driver door, primitive looking headlight leveler and the ridiculously placed cup holders. - Some badly finished bits like thin ceiling line, inferior quality rear view mirror, rough and scratchy dashboard, plastics that makes creaking noises. - Squealing sound on hard pressing the brakes at low speeds (this was prominent until my first service. Once I took the car on the highway, the sounds have faded off). - Airlock in the brakes after the car is stationary for over 24 hours. You will have to hard press the brakes to fire up the engine. Disengaging the handbrake with the brake hard pressed releases some air. - Sharp pot holes come crashing into cabin. Dont get me wrong, but it's just the noise and not the ride. The ride is planted and you are not thrown around - Sometimes on engaging D mode, the rear view camera turns on and does not go away. That's because, to come to the D mode, you will have to first traverse R-reverse and N-neutral (PRNDL). If you are very quick, the camera that turns on at R, gets stuck and does not go even when you start driving. The workaround is to go back to R and come back to D. Once I figured out the cause, it's not concerning anymore. But the lag, that's definitely an issue. - Dust gets collected in the door frames. That's probably because of insufficient sealing. I am not sure. - My biggest gripe of all, I got a 14 inch spare wheel instead of a 15 inch one. Thats just unacceptable. A terrible cost cutting idea. What I like: My likes outweighs the dislikes by a huge margin. - The styling is so European. It is Flamboyant! Especially in the Stealth black paint job, it looks stunning. While some say that it looks like a supersized Kwid, that perception will change once viewed in flesh. The reference to Kwid is because, many of us have not seen the other global Renault cars like the Koleos, Kadjar, Arcana, Austral, Megane, Talisman, etc. The design elements of all these global cars can be found in the Kiger as well. Even the updated Alpine 110 design bits have been borrowed in the Kiger. Basically, it's not just the Kiger, but they are shared across the board. - It rides like a big car. I love the seating position and the power bulges on the bonnet are lovely to look at. The bonnet view makes it really easy for driving in traffic and negotiating tight spots. - I like the 1 liter Turbo engine. Its a Nissan developed engine and is exceptionally quick. I enjoy the buzzing sound of the Turbo spooling at low revs and the sound itself. At idle, the engine does not sound impressive and there is a bit of vibration. As soon as you get moving, the mild vibrations fade away completely. - The car can do high speeds all day long. On highway speeds, the car is extremely stable and relaxed. I drove at 140 kmph on some NH48 stretches and the car was surprisingly stable. - The ride is plush. Some talk about body roll, but neither I nor my family felt much of it. My wife and daughter get giddy and cannot take mountain roads in my Dzire. But on this trip, they did not have any discomfort. On crashing into sharp potholes, there is this crashing noise in the cabin, but the ride is not unsettling nor you are thrown around. The suspension is slightly stiff and is to my liking. - I dont have any words to describe the instrument cluster. It's so beautiful and brimming with information. Going back to my first point, this is one such component in Kiger that has trickled its way from some global Renault cars and I feel good about it. - The stepped CVT is absolutely smooth. I cannot thank Renault enough for this set up. At this price, a stepped CVT makes driving so effortless and enjoyable. It works the same in traffic, on highways and on hilly terrain. At speeds in excess of 120 kmph, you will feel the infamous rubber band effect, but the stepped CVT masks it away beautifully. For those not aware, the Xtronic CVT is also from Nissan. - Drive modes are fun and practical. I switch to Sport mode when I am in mood for some fun or when climbing steep broken roads. 90 percent of the time I stick to Normal, because the normal mode has enough grunt to negotiate any terrain with ease. I dont fret over the ECO mode, because I understand its purpose. According to me ECO mode is best suited for highway cruising with Cruise control enabled. From Belgaum to Tumkur I stuck to ECO mode with Cruise Control and I was able to achieve 16 to 17 kmpl. - Cruise control is a welcome addition in the 2022 updated Kiger. It's easy to use and smooth. This is my first time using cruise control and I am enjoying it. I dont like the switch placement though. - The Kiger is a very practical car. My car remains neat from the inside because nothing is strewn around. Everything is tucked in neatly and thanks to the voluminous boot and storage spaces in the cabin. I dont mind about the quirky cup holders because I dont use them. - The build is good. Of course there is the GNCAP 4 rating, but I did bump into a tree in reverse at Bandipur national park. Given the sound from the impact, I was afraid that I might have to change the tailgate. But on inspection I found that to be a small dent. Planning to get it fixed later sometime. The front doors close with a good thud and are confidence inspiring. - City, Highway, Hills, Broken roads, everything combined, I am getting a fuel efficiency of 13.5 kmpl. If you use ECO mode often, it would give you even better fuel efficiency. - Lastly, Renault has included some RS (Renault Sport) elements into the Kiger without actually calling it a RS variant. The headlamp housing, the air dam, the alloys and the red accents, the spoilers, the smoked effect on the tail lamps, the interiors, etc. These are some elements that differentiate regular Renault global models from their RS models. The Renault RS variants are inspired by Formula1 racing and that's quite a legacy for Renault. Those who follow F1 would know that Renault has a glamourous F1 history and is the first car maker to productionize Turbo engines used in F1 racing. I am just happy to be driving a Turbo performance car from their stable The Route: My first long drive on the Renault Kiger was to Bandipur National Park and onward to my home in Kannur, Kerala. I did the following route. Onward: Pune - Chitradurga - Bandipur National Park - Mudumalai National Park - Gudalur - Devarshola - Sultan Bathery - Mananthavady - Home Return: Home - Mangalore - Udupi - Kumta - Hubli - Pune Pune to Chitradurga: The entire trip was fun. Reaching Chitradurga fort took some effort. Google Maps showed a route through the old city with lanes so small that even autorickshaws could not negotiate freely. There was some serious traffic too. At some point the only narrow road I was following was dug up and I was lost. I hired an auto and asked him to pilot my way to the place I was staying. I could negotiate the tight corners with ease and the CVT gearbox was a boon. I just had to focus on the obstacles. From Belgaum to Chitradurga, the drive was absolutely effortless. I was in ECO mode with Cruise enabled. Chitradurga to Bandipur: The next day's drive was even better. It was mostly a 2 lane road after a right turn to Kunigal from the National Highway 48 and I stuck to the Normal mode for the sake of overtaking. Overtaking in ECO is difficult. Somewhere after Kunigal, before I merge to the Nelamangala - Srirangapatna state highway, on a service lane there was a bombed out stretch with craters so deep that it would tear the sump of most sedans or hatchbacks. There were some cars already that were stuck there. I evaluated the craters and then drove through it. I must have slightly scraped the bumper but nothing serious. My happiness knew no bounds. In my Dzire, negotiating some stretch like that would have been impossible. But Kiger took it in its stride and proved its mettle. Rest of the trip was smooth sailing. I camped at the Bandipur Safari Lodge for couple of day and did some safaris. That's where I ended up with a dent after banging a tree in reverse. Fortunately the dent did not impact the tailgate lock. Bandipur to Home (Kannur): Though I had a shorter route via Muthanga range of Wayanad wildlife sanctuary, I chose the longer route home. I continued on the Ooty road, crossed Mudumalai and the beautiful little town of Gudalur. This route is a childhood nostalgia. Devarshola is also a beautiful town with tea estates all around. The road to Sultan Bathery is very twisty and I put the Kiger to the test. It did give me a decent mileage even on those roads. I had a light foot on the accelerator and braked only when necessary. I also tried descending in the Low gear and it works well. This will help you to descend steadily and you will not have to work your brakes often. I finally reached my home via Sultan Bathery and Mananthavady Home (Kannur) to Pune On my return leg, I drove to Pune via Mangalore, Kumta, Yellapura and Hubli. I started early at 3am to avoid the road repair and traffic from Kannur to Mangalore (NH17). The morning breakfast at Udupi is something I always crave for while on this route and a scenic tea break at the Maravante beach. It was a relaxed drive all along and I was enjoying 1980s Synthwave on the Arkamys surround system. It has a great sound quality and coupled with the wireless Andriod auto, it a pleasant experience. The cabin was quiet all along. This is the first time I am sharing a review on team bhp. With not much ownership experiences out there for Renault Kiger, I am sure my experience will help some users to simplify their car buying decision. I must have missed a lot of other information that some of you might be looking for, but feel free to ask in the forum section. I will try to answer them. I will try to pen down some of my trips too as a travelogue going forward. Thanks for reading Will soon share some pictures from the trip. The large boot swallowed all the luggage with enough space for few more small bags. The cabin did not have any luggage strewn around and also the dual glove box came in very handy.

In fact,i can't understand why people would even consider the Sonet and the Venue,when the Kiger is safer,more spacious,and has more useful features in mid trims(rear wiper,defogger,etc) and costs about 2L cheaper! The only compromise is on interior quality,which is not so bad that it's a deal breaker.", 11th January 2023,renault-kiger,Bangalore,8,15

Has not having ESP or Traction Control, affected your driving in any way or your peace of mind? Thank you. Not having ESP and traction control has not yet affected me. The car is stable at high speeds and on sudden maneuvers the car is composed. Does not ever feel out of control. My observations are at speeds of 80 to 120. Beyond those speeds I am not sure. I drove on an oily stretch as well, but the car was able to maintain good traction. I had a bit of off road experience in a grassland and in sport mode the car has enough low end torque to come out of most sticky situations. Traction could be a problem in marshy and slushy conditions. Kind of roads where even cars with regular traction control may fail. Otherwise, the Kiger would do just fine.", 14th January 2023,renault-kiger,PNQ-BLR-CNN,69,117

Also please let us know the city milage too, including parameters like number of occupants, typical speeds, AC usage etc. Looks like getting double digit milage in city in this car is a pipe dream. CVT works good in traffic too. I sometimes switch to Eco mode in stop/go traffic. Currently I get an average (highway and city) of 14 kmpl (with mostly 2 or 3 on board). The struggle with single digit mileage is temporary. Once you complete the initial 2000 kms and once you hit couple of highway runs, the mileage significantly gets better. If you are using the car only for City runs, I would recommend you stick to Eco mode. The initial days I had a mileage of just 8kmpl and that's possibly because I was doing only city traffic. It also boils down to the driving style. If one belts a Turbo engine, it would perform, but at the cost of high fuel consumption. If the car is driven with a light foot and if you use the power as needed (such as overtakes and some periodic fun driving in the sports mode), you will be able to juice up an acceptable mileage. On the highways, I was able to get 17 to 18 kmpl. Also, its a good practice to use the Eco mode while cruising on the highway (with cruise control on). 80-100 kmph is where the car feels extremely refined, easy and gives the best mileage. Above 100 kmph, the mileage is still okay. Even at 120 kmph, with reduced braking, you can get 16 to 17 kmpl. Sports mode at high speeds and doing 120 or above is not recommended. You literally will have to pay a heavy price for that. AC works good. AC is extremely silent. There is a slight fan sound only when you increase the fan speed to 4 or above. The AC is effective and does not impact the driving experience. I did a lot a hill runs in the Nilgiris with AC fulltime on.", 7th February 2023,renault-kiger,PNQ-BLR-CNN,69,117

City mileage in this car is not great in this car although Highway makes up for it. If the car is intended for city use only, then one should be ready to be disappointed with the mileage numbers which could very well be in single digits. The car in City is now a days driven in Eco mode all out and the mileage is now 10.6 km/ltr with 1-2 passengers on board, AC always on, Bangalore Traffic. This engine is meant for the highway where it feels home and returns a mileage of 17 km/ltr approx. Update : I had reported squeeking noise of the wiper blades.

93, envira , 12:07 ,Newbie,"My observations after riding 2000km on my 1-month-old Kiger - RXZ Turbo CVT and First service Details of the car: Model: RXZ Turbo Transmission: CVT Year - MY 2022 Color: Dualtone Caspian Blue and Black. Total No of Kilometers: 2300 km. I have recently bought the car from Harsha Motors, Visakhapatnam. We took the delivery on the 1st of January 2023. Since then I have been driving it almost 4-5 times a week. Each ride is a minimum of 100-120km drive to the nearest city of Visakhapatnam from Vizianagaram. The ride primarily is a mixed Highway and City drive - 70/30 ratio split. My initial observations regarding the car: Underwhelming Aspects: Exterior 1. Shoddy paint job - The paint seemed fine when checked indoors. But the real quality of reflection during the bright sunshine revealed its actual color. The finish is not fine and really feels cheap. 2. Wiper Blade Sound - Wipers are producing heavy noise when operated. 3. Gaps and spaces - Less refinement and usage of cheap plastic wheel arches which left huge gaps in between. 4. Fender Lining - Really pathetic job. They should have provided a proper fender lining. It looks incomplete as told by OP. 5. Original Accessories - Wind Deflectors - Cheap plastic and are of pathetic quality. It's been just a month since they have been installed and they are losing their sticking. 6. Lights - The headlight has less intensity and feels inadequate. They should have provided better lamps. Driving at night on darker roads needs careful handling. Interior 1. Hard plastic interiors - an all-black design with hard plastics is really not expected in this car at that price. The cabin feels cheap when compared to its competitors in the segment. The dashboard, Door panes, door lock/unlock mechanism, handles, Rear view mirror, etc are really cheap. 2. NVH - a) Lots of noise from the exterior is communicated into the cabin. The noise suppression is really bad. When cruising at 75+ kmph the wind gush is clearly audible. b) Engine noise during Idlling - When the car is idle with the engine on, the grunting sound is heard in the cabin. c) Vibration - Lots of minor rattles are heard from the doors during the ride. Also, I have observed that when traveling alone the co-passenger seat minimally rattles which gives an uncomfortable feel. 3. Air Conditioning - The performance is quite average even during the daytime during the winter. At a blower level above 3, the gush of air could be heard which adds to the noise in the cabin. 3. Upholstery - Seats don't have a leatherette finish, although this is subjective, other brands in this segment offer the finish in their top trims which Renault should have provided them in their top-end cars. 4. Quality of Seatbelts - very poor quality of the seatbelts, and for the driver, it is almost impossible to access the seatbelts and lock them. Apart from these exterior and interior aspects, there are a few other cons for this car. 1. Brake Sound - The brake produces a horrible screeching sound that is really irritating especially during the mornings when you take your car out. Even a lorry's brakes are smooth when compared to the ones on this machine. 2. Cabin Pressure - The cabin feels pressurized when entered, which I have personally felt. Again this is subjective, and I have observed that there is a very high pressure within the cabin which actually for a brief period made me uncomfortable. 3. The auto central locking feature of the door - The doors have an autolocking feature that can be activated only by a long push of a button on the main console which is fine. But when you try to open the door from inside again you have to access the button on the console which I feel is inappropriate. The main reason is that in case of emergencies, it is difficult to escape if the door is locked, and in a panic situation, one forgets about the button on the console. This has to be answered at least. 4. Stock Tyres - I have gotten the stock rubber of MRF make, Wanderer to be specific, which I quite didn't like as it is not so comfortable and jerky. They should have added wider profile tires of at least 205mm or 215mm. The Good 1. Engine - I am in love with the engine performance, especially the CVT version although it is a 3-pot one. It is a fun machine to drive with little or minimal lag. Only once I had experienced the so-called ""Rubber band"" effect. I rode all the 2000+ km in Normal mode and never switched on to the Eco or sport mode. The maneuvering is easy even for the inexperienced and handling this car is a breeze even in heavy traffic conditions. 2. Look and Presence on Road - It is one car in this segment that has better design aesthetics when compared to its competitors. It has an amazing road presence and surely is a head-turner. My wife initially liked the car the rear design in particular which I think Renault has made a good job of making this beauty. 3. Drive Quality, Suspension - As said this engine is fun to drive and it is coupled with a fine-tuned suspension. I felt the thud of larger potholes but on bad roads with smaller ones, it rides on like a breeze. I have maximally clocked a speed of 110kmph on an expressway and the vehicle is rock solid and stable even at that speed. I am usually a sedate driver and clock an average speed of 75-80kmph. 4. Steering and Controls - The steering is light and easy to maneuver. The turning radius is decent and never felt difficult in the sharpest of turns. Navigating through traffic is like slicing butter with a sharp knife. I enjoyed the steering pretty much. 5. Seats and Comfort - The seats are really good with adequate lumbar support and I found them to be comfortable for long hours. The rear seats, as told by my aunt who used them more than me, as I am the driver, are comfortable and she never felt any inconvenience during the ride. The leg room is very good, and even taller adults could sit comfortably in the rear. 6. Space(Cabin, Boot) - This car is a little less wide in this C-SUV segment when compared to its friends among other brands. But it has a very decent amount of space in the cabin for storage. Two glove boxes, A wide space beneath the center console give adequate space in the cabin. Boot space is one of the highest in the segment, which is very much adequate for a small to medium family for a week-long trip. I am impressed with the design which actually accommodates such space although the vehicle looks small from the outside. 7. Audio System and Connectivity - The audio system is finely tuned and performs well in mids and highs. The connectivity is rather fast and never laggy. The latest update of the android auto makes it much more fun to use as it supports a split screen like that of Apple car play. 8. Additional features - Cruise control is a fun addition and I loved this feature. My previous cars never featured this function and I thoroughly enjoy this on long highway stretches. Some Aspects I do not want to comment on - Missing features - TPMS, Hill Hold, ESP, TC - answered in the latest 2023 edition. Mileage - It is just 2000 km on a new car, and I will update this after my second service. For now, I get 10-12kmpl in the city and 15-17 kmpl on highways, and the combined average is about 13-14 kmpl. My Experience with the Renault Sales and Service 1. Sales - I actually am impressed with the sales guys at Harsha Renault in Visakhapatnam. They closely followed up on the booking and processed it fast. Post delivery they followed up every week till my first service and are in close touch with me which I have never expected, unlike my previous 2 vehicles. A 4.5/5 for their sales team for their skills in handling a customer. 2. Service - The First service was done at 2000 km odo, which is a mixed experience. Although the first service is just washing and cleaning the car, they barely answered my queries regarding the brake sound, in cabin rattles. They just try to convince us that the sounds are normal rather than addressing the actual cause. Post car wash I observed that the cleaning was not on par and left marks on the car. I had to inform my sales friends, and they got the car cleaned again. So for the service, I rate a 2/5, and this is where they should improve. So, overall the purchase is a mixed bag for me. Although I could have extended my budget by a few more bucks for a better-finish car in this segment, I have opted for this car. Now that there is no turning back, I look forward to answering all the shortcomings, by the service center and making it a better one. Thank you for your time in reading this.

94, sid_sawhney , 20:33 ,Newbie,"I totally understand your feelings. When I bought my Kiger a year ago, it immediately seemed like a rushed decision to me. I was irked by the quality of interiors, the awkward interior finishing between door panels and windows, the tucked in seatbelt fasteners, oh and the awful brake noise. I would sit in cabs and realize how cars which are significantly less priced just felt better finished. Given the fact, I had been longing for a car since quite sometime and how so many 'very visible' elements were not to my liking, I found it very hard to like (let alone love my car). It's a terrible feeling to feel like that about something that you love. To add to that, my first service experience was worse. They messed up my DRL, couldn't do anything about the brake noise and had poor QA overall. I am now overly skeptical of Renault service and am anxious about my 1 year/10k service which is due this month. But having said that, now it's been a year and I've been on plenty of rides with my Kabira (yep, that's what me and my wife have named it). I've gotten around to it's faults. After constant complaining to the service guys, the brake noise has slightly gotten down. I've gotten used to the panel gaps and weird unlocking mechanism. I think what has helped me is that everybody who has driven or sat in my car has really liked it. On first glance, the centre console does amo up the interior giving it a plush look. It's spacious, offers a smooth ride and coasts over terrible roads. And finally, my wife loves it. So she is always showering praises on the car. It's also the car who she has learned how to drive on. Aside from all these external acknowledgements, what I've realized ot that in day to day usage the Kiger forms an excellent package. And those things really matter once you really get to using your car. Interiors can be spruced up through minor upgrades, they can be kept fresh through regular cleaning and shining but what matters eventually is whether it drives well - everywhere, everytime with or without people And that's what I've realized over the one year of having the Kiger. It's just a very good package of the things that matter. A generally sorted car which can be quite exciting as soon as you put it on sports mode A really spacious car which can accommodate five reasonable sized adult people A really spacious boot Ability to take on any road Sexy Looks Android Auto+Car Play with above average sound Lots of storage! Everytime I drive the car I derive benefit from almost (if not all) the above listed which makes it a wonderful experience for me and everyone seated in the car. And I know whatever irks me, can be fixed through updates which I can look forward to in the future. So, through my ramble, if I can leave you with something is... Give it a little bit time and make some memories with the car. You'll find that you've made a pretty sensible decision and the things that irk you now will irk you lesser and lesser over time. Wishing you many many happy miles. Fellow Kiger CVT owner ", 20th February 2023,renault-kiger,Bengaluru,6,16

Thank you for your suggestion. Soon, I am planning a trip in the car and I wish that your words might come true. Update: After my rant/review, Renault India took notice of this, which I am glad about, and contacted me. They have assigned a service from my local service center to answer all my queries. I have taken the car to the service center a few days ago. I have talked to the Head of the service at Harsha Renault. The main issues which I wanted to get fixed are the In cabin rattles, Wiper sound/rub, Stiff suspension, brake sound, and Sound while cruising at 75+ kmph. They have opened the door panels and re-fixed/adjusted the clamps. regarding the brake sound the service engineer showed me the company manual which showed that brake sound occurs in these CVT vehicles when the speed is less than 5 kmph and they are trying to fix it in further updates. They have worked on the suspension by changing the torque and now the suspension feels a bit better, although I need to get on to the off-road to check it. The other issues like wiper sound, and panel gaps, still need to be addressed. Renault has assured me that these would be fixed at the soonest.

96, exec2063 , 12:44 ,Newbie,"I have completed 2000 kms in 6 months. In fact I had to do the first service when the odometer was only about 900 kms due to low usage. My issue with the headlights has not changed, even though the service centre adjusted the lights to increase the throw. It has gone up slightly, but the beam is now more towards the left. I have to find out whether I can substitute 80W bulbs for the high beam, currently 40W, without rewiring and invalidating the warranty. Something else I noticed: When the fuel tank is full, the km/l reading starts high and reduces gradually as fuel is consumed. I have not yet confirmed if the reverse is also the case, ie. low km/l when fuel is low and increases when tank is fuller. Re fuel efficiency, on the 'highways' in Kerala, which are mostly 2 lane in South Kerala, and speeds are on average about 30-40 km/hour, I get 13.9 km/l. In the city, it is about 7.5 km/l. I drive in N mode only, never felt the need to change to S or E. Always with a/c on. I was away for a few days and when I returned, the auto door open did not work for a couple of times, but its OK now. Similarly, the Android connect did not work until I manually connected, whereas previously it would play music automatically from my phone if the bluetooth was on.

Not sure if you can upgrade. - The issue with muddy water from the tail lamp is sorted. My car is 6 months (MY 22 model). From the 2022 update, the issue seems to be resolved. - The Infotainment system works flawlessly. The wireless Android Auto / Apple Car play auto connects 98/100 times automatically. It's not buggy in anyway, but sometimes when you move from R to D, the reverse camera does not go away (very rare). You may have to be gentle in your gear switch from R to D or P. - Full house performance is good. Since you are going for the Turbo pick, I don't think you will have a problem. Also in CVT, you will not miss the manual override function and you will not feel the need to go sport mode unless you are planning to have some fun - I have not driven Altroz, but have driven Nexon. Kiger has some rough edges in the interiors, but in no way bad. The quality is very durable and the full black interiors mask these rough edges. Performance wise, I would go for Kiger, because apart from the 3 cylinder thrum at idle, the car is very silent once you get going. In the speeds of 80 to 100, the car is silent and the drive is effortless. Overtaking at these speeds also is effortless. And, you have the drive sense modes to play with I would recommend you to go through my comprehensive drive review where I did a 2500 kms round trip.

101, varunkrish1789 , 18:36 ,Newbie,"Five-Month Ownership Review of the Renault Kiger CVT Turbo: A Blend of Power, Comfort, and Some Room for Improvement Introduction: After covering an impressive 6200 kilometers in just five months, I am delighted to share my ownership review of the Renault Kiger CVT Turbo. Trips made so far: 1. Bangalore - Madurai - Bangalore : ~ 850kms 2. Bangalore - Srirangapatnam - Bangalore ; ~240kms 3. Bangalore - Sriangapatname - Bangalore : ~240kms (did this twice for temple run) 3. Bangalore - Tootukodi - Tiruchendur - Palani - Palakkad - Coimbatore - Bangalore : ~1200kms 4. Bangalore - Mysore - Talakadu - Someshwara - Bangalore: ~350kms And multiple drives to breakfast/dinner drives to Murugan Idly, Krishnagiri. Design When it comes to design, it may elicit mixed reactions from potential buyers. While some may find the design polarizing at first glance, I have found that it grows on you over time. The front fascia featuring a prominent grille with sleek LED headlights, gives the car a distinct and assertive look. The sculpted hood and muscular wheel arches further contribute to its sporty appeal. Moving towards the rear, the sloping roofline and integrated roof rails add a touch of dynamism. Engine & Smooth CVT Gearbox: One of the standout features of the Renault Kiger CVT Turbo is its engine and smooth CVT gearbox. The 1.0-liter turbocharged engine offers an impressive power output, delivering ample acceleration and a spirited driving experience. The CVT gearbox, although not as engaging as a manual transmission, ensures seamless gear changes, providing a comfortable and effortless driving experience. The combination of the turbo engine and the smooth CVT gearbox makes for a responsive and enjoyable ride. Even after a long day's drive - one would never feel tired. Interior and the Boot Space: Renault has done an excellent job in designing the Kiger's interior to maximize space utilization. Despite being a compact SUV, the cabin offers a surprising amount of legroom and headroom for both front and rear passengers. This makes long drives and journeys more comfortable, especially for taller individuals. The generous boot space (405 litres) is another standout feature, allowing for hassle-free loading and accommodating bulky luggage with ease. Whether it's a family trip or a shopping spree, the Kiger offers ample room for all your needs. The front and rear seats offer good comfort and reasonably good bolstering. The interiors do look like they have been made out of cheap materials, but for the money and for the tech, the package is acceptable. Also, the boot loading lip could have been lower for ease of loading. Fuel Economy: While the CVT Turbo impresses with its performance, fuel economy is an aspect that falls slightly short. Although not unexpected for a turbocharged engine. I get ~14-15kmpl on the highway and 10-11kmpl in the city. I am sure on the highway it could return some more efficiency if driven sedately at 80-90kmph (will test this out as I have long driving vacation planned next month). The fuel gauge has 8 digital bars, for 1 bar to reduce, it approximately takes 45-50kms. Kiger CVT owners might know what I am referring to by this. Drive Modes: Eco, Normal & Sports - Having the option to switch between these three drive modes adds a level of versatility and engagement to the driving experience. Sports mode really helps when you need quick bursts of power to overtake on the highway. Infotainment System: The touchscreen infotainment system is good. Does not lag. I am not that much of an audiophile to comment on the music system, it works fine for me. I really like the wireless Andriod Auto/Apple Carplay - the connectivity so far has been seamless. More on the audio system in the next section. Service Experience and Niggles: In just 4 months, the touchscreen infotainment failed and I had to get it replaced. The issue was with the hardware as it kept rebooting and overheating. The SA claimed that this was the first time he was seeing a faulty system. The SA at Trident Renault Kalyan Nagar - Mr. Naveen was incredibly helpful. The experience of driving without the infotainment system did cause a lot of trouble. It took about 3 week for the product to be shipped from Austria. Conclusion: I am happy with the purchase I have made as I consciously took the decision to stay away from DCT/DSGs as they were too pricey for me and AMTs as they really dulled the driving experience. TCs would have been an option for me but they didn't fit my budget. Here are some of the snaps from the drives I have had so far. ", 11th June 2023,renault-kiger,Bangalore,1,15

The gear shifts are very notchy, and painful to drive in bumper to bumper traffic where you need to change gears frequently from 1st to 2nd.

111, adithyaravi89 , 19:57 ,Newbie,"I finally went ahead and got the RXZ turbo variant, a white beauty with a black roof! I picked up the car on Thursday and my first ever drive, with my wife, was a 683km trip from my family in Chennai to my home in Hyderabad! The drive was fantastic! It drives beautifully and we didn't feel any fatigue overall. I am light footed on the pedal, so expecting the overall mileage to be pretty good. I had a few questions and would be grateful if anyone could help me out! 1. The armrest console has 2 cupholders but the 2nd one is too small and can probably just take a 500ml water bottle. And also, they are so close by and deep, that it is difficult to take out the coffee cuppas. So, is there any other solution for 2 good cupholders in the front? 2. The apple carplay was working beautifully till it didn't it just disconnected and it took a long time and a lot of frustration for the missus before it connected again. Anyone else face the same and have any fix for this? 3. There so many nooks and crannies in the front of the car, when it gets dark, we really need to feel around a lot. The light (supposed to be ambient lighting) that is pre-installed, definitely is not enough. Has anyone gotten the mood light installed from Renault directly? Is it good? 4. Continuation of the above question, if not, has anyone tried installing ambient lights outside? How does it impact the electrical warranty? Thank you so much in advance! I'm looking forward to some great drives with this beauty.", 9th July 2023,renault-kiger,Hyderabad,13,8
112, Refan , 23:06 ,Newbie,"Here is my review of the new Renault Kiger CVT RXZ Turbo MY2023 Pros Looks: Definitely has a great road presence. The front grille, DRLs, LED lights and tailgate lights make it one of the best-looking cars. I personally liked the style and effort Renault put into its design. Cabin space: One of the best in the segment. Looks spacious and can comfortably accommodate 5 reasonably sized adults. Lots of storage spaces and the space has been optimally utilised. Boot: 400L boot is more than sufficient for family outings. Though the loading lip is a bit high, it can easily accommodate 1 large suitcase and 2 medium-sized suitcases + small bags. Engine and gearbox: The main positive of Kiger is definitely its turbo engine and CVT gearbox. The gearbox is smooth and you hardly feel the gear shifts. The engine definitely has a lot of power especially when revved to over 2500 rpm. Overtaking is easy and there's adequate power when pressed hard. Slowly, you will start enjoying the sound of its engine. Even on steep slopes, it doesn't complain much. Once the speed crosses 90, it is pure delight. The engine feels more comfortable and buttery smooth and it is best suited to those speeds. Driving modes: Sport: If you are a car lover you will enjoy the Sport mode the most. The car is extremely smooth and you can feel the power and the potential of its turbo engine. Eco: As the name suggests, is best suited for mileage. But it's difficult to drive at lower speeds in Eco mode since the pickup is very low. It is best to use this mode while driving on highways with cruise control on. It will give you marginally increased fuel efficiency. Normal: Nicely sandwiched between the other two modes, this is the mode which I use most of the time. If revved hard, it will give you the necessary power - similar to Sport mode and can still be used in bumper-to-bumper city traffic. Service: In Tamil Nadu, in the city, I feel the service centre is very good. They are approachable and they answer your questions well. So far it's been good. They treat you like a premium customer. The reason may be the lesser number of cars when compared to Tata or Maruti or Hyundai. Sound and infotainment: I love the Arkamys surround sound system. The Sony speakers give you good woofer effects and the stereo effects are nicely captured. Though not the best in segment it is still more than decent. The touchscreen is good with nice response. I haven't face any lag so far. Apple CarPlay/Android Auto works fine. Driving dynamics: The car feels planted at high speeds and even in sharp turns, there's minimal body. Suspension is balanced between hard and soft and you can hardly feel the small bumps on the road. Even after long trips you will be comfortable thanks to its well tuned suspension and seats. The brakes are fine and the car doesn't lose composure if the brakes are applied at higher speeds. The steering feedback is very good and based on the drive mode, steering adjusts the weight itself. The car remains stable and gives me proper support/adjustments even when I go through curves at high speeds. Features: I think it covers the main features at this price point. Cruise control, TPMS, ESC, traction control, brake assist and hill hold assist. Except a 360-degree camera and ventilated seats, you could get almost every necessary feature. Con's: Creaky noises: There is brake noise, especially at the start when you take out the car. It has reduced over time but has not completely gone. The service guys said it will gradually fade off. Sometimes the steering also makes creaky sounds. The service guys said it would go away over time and the sounds are due to it being a new vehicle. Plastics: It is a VFM car and the main reason you feel it not premium only because of the plastics. The plastics, especially the interior door handle plastics, give it a feel of a budget car. Though the interior could have been better, it's definitely not bad. It is adequate but could have been better, at least in the top variants. Rear camera: The clarity of the rear camera could have been better. On a bright sunny day or in optimum light it is alright, but it struggles in extreme brightness when directly opposite to the sun. Night vision could have been better. Features that could have been available with accessories: A few features like 360-degree camera, ventilated seats, and vehicle tracking/vehicle data through Apps like Renault Connect could have been provided at least as an option or at least for top trim variants. Mixed bag: Fuel efficiency: Fuel efficiency is better on the highway. On highway drives, I can get around 16 km/l but not the promised 18/19 km/l by the sales/service team. In mixed driving conditions (city and highway) I was getting around 14 km/l. In city traffic, it returns between 8 to 11 km/l max. This is similar to its competitors, but I expected a bit more since I was driving with a light foot most of the time. The service team said it would gradually improve after first service. Headlight: The headlight throw is very good. You could clearly see the LEDs performing well. But on open roads when there is no reflector/object in front and a vehicle comes from the opposite side with its headlights on high beam, I can sense the throw could have been better. The service team asked me to adjust the light knob, but even after adjusting it, I am yet to get the desired throw. Vibrations at idle: I expected vibrations at low speeds since it is a 3-cylinder engine. When you stop at signals and if the gear shifter is in D mode, you can feel a lot of vibrations and if the gear shifter is in N mode, they reduce a bit. The damping could have been better and similar to its competitors to reduce the vibrations. Though not a big complaint, the vibration level could have been better. Conclusion: Overall, I'm liking the car for its peppy engine, smooth CVT gearbox, great looks and very good driving dynamics. I feel that I made the right choice in buying the Kiger. No regrets so far and I'm loving this car, especially the Sport mode. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and others.

114, jomyboy , 16:01 ,BHPian,"MyKiger2023 This is my first post on this group and Im mighty excited to lay bare my journey on deciding on a new car for our family, which is primarily driven by my wife for her office commute in Mumbai, which is primarily a distance of 16 km, which at peak office time takes roughly about 2 hours to cover. We have owned Hyundai Accent, Maruti Swift and lastly Hyundai Xcent (all petrol manual variants). Driving a manual gear in Mumbai traffic was taking its toll and hence we decided to look for a new automatic car that would, hopefully, bring back some ease into the commute. Whats more, the Xcent was having problems with some part or the other every year driving up the ownership cost. After having owned two Hyundai cars, I have come to realize that after three/four years its a downhill experience with Hyundai and Hyundai replacement parts are not cheap!! Thus began our search with googling the internet to find the most VFM automatic car in 2023. I went through most reviews of every car in my budget on YouTube and forums on the Internet including Team BHP. From what I could absorb, NA engines with 4 cylinder engines were the best bet according to the experts, which swayed me towards the Honda Amaze CVT and Brezza VXI AMT. We first headed towards the Honda showroom and having driven the Honda Amaze CVT, I must say it is a car worth every penny for city bumper to bumper driving. Googling the Internet, I found that a new facelift is to debut in 2024, which kind of killed my interest in the current generation because there were quite a few features missing in the present car including TPMS. Next we headed to the Maruti showroom. Brezza VXI AMT has quite a lot of features missing for the price it commanded. I thought the car was OVERPRICED big time and came to the decision rather swiftly of getting a three cylinder engine with turbo if it offered better value. We first headed to Hyundai to test drive the Venue DCT and I was not at all impressed with its looks or driving aesthetics, moreover the rear felt crampy, but my wife liked it and as she was going to drive it every day who was I to complain. Still we decided to explore and see what else is available in the market. Next we headed to KIA, which in my opinion has the best looking car out there both exteriorly and interiorly in the automatic range in Kia Sonet. With the premium price it commanded and having read the horror stories about the DCT gearbox in city bumper traffic, we decided that it was not for us. In the meanwhile, I chanced upon a white Renault and the car was really eye catching. I made a note of Renault Kiger as it passed by me. I did an extensive search on Renault Kiger and it seemed the most VFM and even more in comparison to its rivals. There were quite a few complaints about mud problems with car, but it seems with the new Kiger 2023 the company had it all sorted out. When discussing with friends and colleagues, they all dissed the car like its some sort of China made product even though one had ever owned a Renault car. I wonder why people have this negative connotation about Renault? Whats more, initially I was having a hard time differentiating between a Renault Kwid and a Renault Kiger. My wife decided there and then that she did not want to even look at the car, let alone drive it. But going through all the comparisons, it seemed a no-brainer that this is the most VFM car out there. I eventually managed to coax her to at least see and drive the car before giving up on it. When I first saw the Renault Kiger in the showroom, I was absolutely gobsmacked! It really is beautiful and stylish with a whole load of space inside. It really felt big on the inside. They didnt have the CVT Turbo to test drive at that moment and asked me if they could get it to my home, which was a downer for me. Anyways, when I did finally get hold of it, the drive was a pleasure. We took it on a steep incline with four of us onboard and in normal mode it had no problems pulling itself up. We, or rather I, immediately knew this is it! That is how good the test drive felt. It checked all the boxes with regards to CVT reliability in bumper to bumper traffic, ease of driving, and from a learned source the CVT mated to a turbo is the best combination that one can have for city drives. All this while, friends and relatives were still lecturing us on resale value and how Renault might wind up pretty soon. But the car had felt good to drive and we decided that our safety and convenience within our budget should take precedence. With that in mind, we decided to bite the bullet and go ahead with booking the car from Landmark Juhu and within a week got our car delivered on 29th June. The negatives: First up is the TPMS. Rather than proper number readings, it shows only OK for all four tires and it will do so until it goes below 25% from the set reading. It definitely feels down market, but well something better than nothing. The wipers make a lot of noise and it doesnt even clean the view properly if it is a slight drizzle. Moderate to heavy rains arent a problem though. There is an irritating screeching sound while breaking at low speeds. I had the exact same problem with my 2014 Xcent, hence it doesnt bother me that much as I am sort of used it now, but would have preferred a smoother experience. When at idle, there is quite a bit of vibration thanks to the 3-cylinder engine, but that can be negated by changing the gear from D to N and the vibrations fade away. Front parking sensors: The sound, usefulness and fit quality, everything about it is so down-market. I was so disappointed that I switched it off from the showroom itself, yes its that bad! Fuel Efficiency: I am getting about 6.5 Km/L having travelled 1000 km. Havent taken the car out for any leisure travel yet, will do that after the first service. For some reason, this car gets very very dirty when driving in the rains. Our car cleaner says he has to work doubly hard to clean the mud from our car. It is so bad some days it looks like our car has been through a rally cross! The headlights feel inadequate for me. They should have provided better lamps; however, with high beam, there is better throw. Seatbelts: Even in 2023, problems with accessing the seatbelts still persist. Its not a deal breaker, but I would have hoped with time they could have done something to sort things out. The A-Pillar with the ORVM creates a serious blind spot. Surprisingly, it has caused me more bother despite being 63 and sitting tall whereas my wife who is 56 has not found it as much a distraction. One-month ownership experience: Its been a month since we got the car and the car is truly a gem! It has got some road presence and people do stare a bit longer at your car -- I dont know if it is because you do not see so many Kigers on the road, but I guess it definitely helps. The sound of the turbo spooling is exhilarating. There is also no more of the fatigue of driving through traffic, which is a blessing. A lot of people have been complaining about the AC effectiveness, but I find it more than adequate. The temperature is always set at 26 with ACC switched on and I have never had a chance to complain. The audio setup is good and should suffice most people. With the heavy rains that we have had in Mumbai recently, I have had the chance to thread through flooded subways recently and the car performs a charm. Full marks to Kiger on getting the ground clearance right, the only downside being some minimal body roll. Special mention again to the space management inside the car as although the vehicle looks smaller from the outside, it feels big on the inside where it really counts. How they have managed that with such a big boot space is a marvel in automobile engineering. This is truly the USP of the car. I look forward to posting my next update once I am done with the first service and a proper long drive to Lonavala/Pune. Till then, as they say in French, Au Revoir!

Listening to music with the engine off will eventually drain your battery. If your battery is in great condition, then you should be able to listen to music for several hours without a problem. The problem comes a few years down the line with wear and tear. Even leaving your headlights on for just a few minutes with the engine switched off can cause your battery to fail. Also, it is important to remember the louder you play your music the more your battery drains, especially with the car switched off and the windows open you tend to play your music system louder. Scrolling through previous posts, here is a trick that someone has come up with: You can indeed use the infotainment system while the ignition is off. Just have to turn on the nightime drls and you're good to go. THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED AND DO USE THE SYSTEM LIKE FOR A PROLONGED AMOUNT OF TIME. I have had major battery problems with my Swift and Xcent and had to change my battery every alternate year . It is only now I that I have learnt that using any appliance that uses the battery with the engine switched off is a bad idea.

124, Petropolitan , 15:18 ,Newbie,"Hi, I have a query about Kiger vehicle. This is not specifically about CVT variant but about Kiger in general. Mod may kindly move this under the correct thread, if this is not the right one. I am looking for a suitable alternative to Brezza (2020) which was stolen from my residence. I am still waiting for the compensation. I am looking at the Renault Kiger as one of the options. I understand that the mud accumulation issue near rear wheel has been addressed. To me, Kiger's keyless entry system appears to be unsafe. I understand that all four doors open up automatically as soon as the key is taken near the vehicle. In Brezza, taking the key near the vehicle does not open the door automatically. Pressing unlock from FOB or Handle request sensor once would open ONLY the driver side. Is there any way to program Kiger similarly?", 21st August 2023,renault-kiger,New,17,3
125, jomyboy , 14:57 ,BHPian,"Hello fellow BHPians: It has been two months now since we have had the Kiger and the car has just been fantastic. It definitely has grown on me. The car has superseded my desires of what car comfort should be! Its a superbly tuned CVT turbo engine. I do not know what gripe Gagan (YouTuber) has with the performance of the CVT turbo, but for me it performs a charm. I have had no problems going metal to pedal, albeit with a slight lag, to get any overtaking manoeuvres done. The engine is quite peppy and fun, and coming from Swift and Xcent I am so glad to own a car with the same zing. The drive quality, suspension, steering, and seats have been top notch up until now. The rear seat comfort is even better than the front seats. I got my first free service done at the Benchmark Andheri. I went ahead and got the antirust coating done for my own satisfaction. It was a lazy day at the showroom and I was attended to and got my car delivered back fairly quickly. The rubber beading, which I had installed in a haphazard manner, had come off whilst cleaning. Asked for it to get re-fitted and they did so in a much more professional manner. The car wash sadly left a lot to be desired. We had got this beautiful piece at at 12.6 lakhs OTR with car discount, corporate discount, exchange bonus, etc. Totally VFM! I hope to be able to post with the same pride in three years' time Fuel Economy Issue: I was surprised to know that people owning the Hyundai I20 IVT also get 6 kmpl or even less in city bumper to bumper driving conditions. A relative driving the Hyundai Venue DCT N-line gets 4 kpml. Somehow the Kiger gets more brickbats amongst its peers. Having said that, the Kiger comes into its own once you hit 80+ and are cruising, the FE bar hovers between 20-30 kpml all the time. Once you have gained speed, the key is to play with the accelerator with a light foot (press and release) and lo behold you strike gold! The seatbelt issue, which was a major irritant in the first month, seems to have been resolved by way of muscle memory. We have no problems getting the seatbelt hooked on now that we are used to it except when in a hurry, then the darn belt just will not get hooked! The grime under the door problem has been resolved by installing the rubber seals from MediaNav solutions. That is one must-have accessory for the Kiger! The android auto problem that we had also has got resolved. I just happened to start the car with my airdopes on Bluetooth one fine day and for some reason the android auto system recognised my phone and started working after that. The keyless experience has been fantastic. Without taking out the card from my pocket/wifes handbag, we are able to enter, start, switch off and get out without a bother and it works every time without fail. I didnt think much of it at the time when we were told about it at the showroom and thought it more a façade; however, it is a feature that I will dearly miss if and when I change my car . Sure its got its own set of problems, e.g. once we parked our car in front of a fast-food restaurant and were sat in the open area, but due to the close proximity to our car parked outside, the doors had opened; luckily, no harm done. I understand it can be a safety issue for some if all doors open when you are near the car and I dont think you can get it re-programmed to open just one door, but you can use the key inside the card to manually open only the driver's door (I think) if you were ever in that situation. Other than that, the keyless card feature is a keeps for me! I have started to notice stones trapped in the tyre threads, a bit too many for my liking. Has anyone changed tyres and observed a difference? Also, is it going to be a problem on expressways at speeds of 100-120?", 28th August 2023,renault-kiger,MUMBAI,88,194

I just happened to stumble on a video in YouTube explaining how this is done. Yes, it appears that this feature of automatic opening of all doors can be stopped by long pressing the open key in FOB. But again, once the open key is pressed after getting near, still ALL DOORS OPEN, and not merely the drivers' side. This, to me, appears weird. Anyway, I am still looking for decent choices.

131, jomyboy , 12:34 ,BHPian,"As my two-month first service was done, it was time to test the limits of the car and there is no better place than the roads and adjoining areas of JNPT on Sunday afternoons. The car does not disappoint at all going past 130+ and on fast sweeping curves the car felt very well planted. The car is fun and you feel connected with it and if I may as a hyperbole “you feel in control of all the chaos around you.” Full marks to the car and CEAT tyres in that respect! Trying to go hammer and tong from 0 to 100+, I first hand got to experience what is a stepped CVT. It almost felt like the car momentarily stops in its linear acceleration and changes gear or something to that effect. It’s the first time I ever felt it, but it is also the first time that I really pushed the car hard. While at the first service, I saw an entire black Kiger with red alloy inserts. I decided to get one for myself as well and those red inserts have grown on me. The car looks more aggressive now, complementing my Sunday driving composure Now let’s bash the car as well. The car has started rattling a bit in its third-month. It’s not very pronounced, but I am not sure if the car will hold its own in the long-term. I will join in chorus with my fellow colleagues to say this car is built to a cost. At this point though I can still live with it because the car drives like a superstar, so if I were playing the stock market I would still keep my bets on the “buy option.” It is the first time in my life that I have managed to drive 1000 km on four Sundays in a month driving from Mumbai to New Mumbai. I have even received my SBI BPCL card seeing my monthly petrol costs running upwards to 10,000 now. Only later did I realise there is a better reward value card in SBI Octane. Now onto something which I did not like about the car at high speeds, which are the brakes; it does not inspire confidence. It does not have a sharp bite like the previous Xcent of mine and if the car is driven at high speeds you better make sure you have clear roads ahead and be absolutely on your guard. This is the first time I am driving a car with ABS, TCS, etc. so I am not sure if that is contributing to the general decline in brake bite. The door edge guard accessory from my left front door has fallen off. Also, the chrome handle on the left front door has become a bit loose. Having sat in a friend’s Duster recently, I came away a tad disappointed with the suspension of my Kiger. I was gung ho about the suspension initially coming from Swift and Xcent and the Kiger is a huge improvement in that regard, but the Duster is in a different league altogether. I do not know if it is because of car length, weight distribution or tyre size characteristics, but the Renault Kiger suspension is a step down from the Duster. I thought I must be one of the few lucky customers who seem to have got a car where the warning sounds do not sound off either at 80 kph or going past 120 kph. I have stopped driving with the music system on nowadays (as house music seems to up my adrenaline I fear) and can hear a faint beep once I cross 80, but the sound is barely perceptible and not intrusive at all. So all in all, a little bit of a mixed bag I would say. Except for the fit quality, there is absolutely nothing else to disown the car. I hope to come back with the same gusto three-five years down the line as well.", 2nd October 2023,renault-kiger,MUMBAI,88,194

The Kiger is one hell of a looker, it is one of the most handsome cars out there, and the colours complement it too, When I was considering replacing my Kwid, the Kiger instantly was the first consideration, and boy did it look great when it came for the test drive, but when it came to fit, finish and quality levels, it remained a notch below the others in the segment, which prompted my family to look for other options and we finally landed at a Kia Sonet Diesel AT, although costlier it seems a wise decision now, and later a Seltos joined our family too. But if you look at the scenario now, with the prices of cars having gone through the roof, especially diesel cars, the Kiger CVT is quite a tempting offer, the Nexon DCA is also great for the comforts it offers. If you compare them, the Nexon is more spacious in the interiors, is 5-star NCAP-rated, has 6 airbags, has Brake Assist, auto-dimming IRVM, 360-degree camera, Front and rear parking sensors, a 10-inch touchscreen, better warranty and overall feels like a better-built car, however fit and finish is still lacking for the price. It's a case of more car for more money and if you feel the need for the extra features and safety, the Nexon is the way to go, else the Kiger is definitely a great car worth recommending.", 2nd October 2023,renault-kiger,Muscat,712,"2,212"

Brake noise - persists and technicians are clueless. I was assured initially that I would disappear in a few months, but everyday I have them. 2.

I replaced the stock wipers with Bosch Frameless wipers, and the wipers make no sound. But the people at the service center don't agree with the fact that their stock wipers are just junk. 5. Mileage - less talked about the best, 10-12 on highways with lighter foot on the pedal, 7-8 in the city. I have used only normal mode and never switched to eco or sport mode. 6. Poor finish - Mud issue in the foot bay, and no proper fender lining to the rear, panel gaps without proper seal. 7. Poor AC - worst I can say, even Suzuki cars that cost half the price of this vehicle outperform the AC of Renault cars.

I just can't live with it and anyone who had their hard-earned money out into a garbage can't just live with it. 7. I see that you are staying in Bengaluru, I wish I had resided there. The weather at our place is not like Bengaluru's weather. We have summer 8-9 months in a year with temperatures above 35 degrees. My other cars never underperformed in this sort of weather. You have the opportunity to use it without AC, but sadly for us we always have to turn it on and it ""underperforms"". For every car in a hill station, the AC performs much better as it is usually turned off.

144, jomyboy , 20:20 ,BHPian,"Six-month review of MyKiger CVT 2023: Before I start off with my experience, I just want to begin by saying one good car or one bad one does not make or break the car. I know there are some who have had genuine heartaches with their ownership experience and others who go about voicing their displeasure about a budget segment car as though it’s a car lining up to race in a Formula 1 championship. I knew what I was getting into when I bought it and I am happy to say it has fit the bill as the perfect car that does everything for me right from being a pickup truck to wanting to be a race car. It has been an amazing experience and I think the world of my car. It’s been almost six months now since we have bought the car and we are just about 100-200 km shy of reaching the 5000 mark. The car has been nothing short of fantastic driving-wise and I would suggest people to ward off from reading and watching old reviews of the car, even the Team-BHP review is of a backdated model. The 2023 version is leaps and bounds over its predecessor and it has been pretty smooth sailing driving-wise till now. It has got a stylish design, turbo power, and ease of driving in town and to top it all its pretty easy to park and manoeuvre in city traffic. It was the best car out there when I went shopping in the market and now six months down the line I am more than convinced that for its price it definitely is still the car of the year going into 2024! The problem this car has had is that with its base version at 6 lakhs, which has dug into the aspirations of people wanting to own a big car, they are now living with the harsh reality of what a six-odd lakhs car can give. Now I am sure niggles will crop up as it gets a year or two older, but right now I have no issues recommending to buy this car, but please do not buy this car if: The first thing on your mind when you are buying a new car is its resale value? Buying a turbo and you are expecting Celerio-type fuel mileage. Buying a three-pot cylinder and looking forward to engine refinement; it vibes dude, all three pots vibe, get over it! Looks: I do not add pictures of my car now as I haven't done anything new to its exterior from my last review. The lines on the bonnet definitely give it a masculine and sporty look. The front view of this car is something that captivated me when I first saw it on the road and it is the only car that I have seen in this price bracket that has more curves than the boxy design which other cars seem to have incorporated. This car is beautifully designed and has a beautiful European flair to it – one of those cars that make you feel young when you are driving it: the perfect dose of adrenaline shot to commemorate your 40s, pure excitement! Sports mode: I have had the chance to use the sports mode now and then and frankly I was absolutely floored to the core! It is insane to have this amount of power within city limits. The car has 99 bhp on paper, but because of its low weight its power delivery is much better than its rivals with the same 3-cylinder 1-litre engine so much so that with the keys in my pocket I have started calling it a “rocket in my pocket.” Secondly, the driving ergonomics is so freaking good, you just cannot complain. I fail to fathom how anyone can find any fault with the turbo version. DO NOT GO BY REVIEWS ON YOUTUBE!! Test drive yourself and this car is more peppier than any other car in its class going from 0 to 20, which on Mumbai roads is like manna from heaven especially given the horrific traffic, and once you get to 70-80 the car just drives beautifully and no matter what undulation gets thrown at its suspension, the car dutifully holds its line. For all the people complaining about plastics and fit quality, I say nothing competes with the car’s mechanicals and the Kiger scores very high on the front. Fuel Efficiency: Having had the first service done and now that the rains have eased away, the fuel mileage has increased to 8 in the city, but I have also noticed that driving without the AC on and at constant 70-80 km/hr it does give me above 20 driving at night, but you do need a certain driving style and clearer roads to achieve those figures. Android Auto and Apple Carplay: After the initial disappointment with getting the phones connected through Bluetooth, not once has the connection lagged or disconnected. I have seen others having problems with theirs, so just a special mention of this prized feature of which I was shocked to experience getting our IPhone connected to Carplay even without the Bluetooth or wifi switched on!!!! Past complaints: The brake noise that I had earlier observed has also subsided. It’s noticeable now and then, but it was never a big problem in the first place. I suggest people to get over the noise and live with it. While the fit and quality of the front parking sensors leaves a lot to be desired, it still gets the job done when you really need it. I am happy that I had installed it; it has served its purpose at times pretty accurately. The blind spot is a sore point. It is the only “big con"" in an otherwise great car. I have had a few close shaves, one too many for my liking and there is just no way out of that. It is the only reason I would say to hold back on buying this car. Though the design element of the tri-LED setup is beautiful, I wish the throw of the lights were a little bit better. Without the high beam, I would not have the confidence to drive this car on the highways. Some things to look forward to in 2024: I look forward to, if Renault offers it, getting the Smart Mirror Monitor. I would have already installed an aftermarket dashcam, but I have been told to wait as Renault will offer it as an accessory in time. An IRVM that doubles up as a video screen as well, how cool is that? This is a car that has its own niggles and rattles, but no car is perfect, but hey if you own this car I’m sure despite its shortcomings you wouldn’t call it anything less than a rocket in your pocket. Looking forward to my one-year review in six months' time, but till then au revoir!", 29th December 2023,renault-kiger,MUMBAI,88,194

Car never felt stressed and the turbo engine was able to reach speeds above 140 kmph effortlessly.

But then it dropped to 15 as the entire 600 km stretch of the expressway was covered with an average speed of 120kmph. Special Mention Wireless Android Auto worked flawlessly throughout the entire journey. Never disconnected once which was very important for me as I was travelling to this part of the country for the first time. Many people who own much more expensive cars complain about their infotainment screens getting stuck or laggy and here is a 10lakh car which has never thrown any such issues in ownership of 1.5 years. Issues: The only issue or complaint that I have is the road noise that comes while driving. It gets really bad on the concrete road, especially when driving at higher speeds. But I think this is a compromise we have to make as the car is built to cost. Overall I am very impressed with Kiger. I have completed 1.5 years with the car and plan to keep it for at least 10 more years. Adding a few pics from my trip. ", 7th January 2024,renault-kiger,Mumbai,15,16
