0, CrAzY dRiVeR , 10:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Volkswagen Taigun Review Volkswagen Taigun ProsHas its own fresh, European character and complements its cousin (the recently launched Skoda Kushaq) nicely in a segment dominated by Indian, Korean and Chinese SUVs Unmistakably VW styling matched with solid European build quality Cabin has good legroom to offer, supportive seats, perfect ergonomics & lots of storage 148 BHP engine makes the Taigun one of the most fun-to-drive crossovers in the segment! Sporty 1.0L & 1.5L turbo-petrols are mated to slick 6-speed MTs & smooth ATs Sorted suspension offers a balanced ride & handling package Safety features include up to 6 airbags, ESC (all variants), 3-point seatbelts for all, electronic differential lock, brake disc wiping, multi-collision brake and more Features like active cylinder tech, ventilated seats (weirdly 1.0 TSI only), sunroof, 10-inch touchscreen with wireless Android Auto and CarPlay, auto headlamps & wipers etc. Advantages over the Kushaq = a top AT variant with 6 airbags, design that stands out more, cabin 'feels' better, fabric seats are executed in a nicer manner... 5-star GNCAP safety rating - full details here! Volkswagen Taigun ConsNo 1.5L diesel is a major disadvantage in a world where petrol costs over 100 bucks/litre GT customers will need to choose between the rock (potential DQ200 transmission problems) and a hard place (GT manual variant misses out on many top-end features) Narrow cabin width makes a 5th adult completely unwelcome. Best for 4 onboard Interior colour scheme and quality don't feel up to traditional VW standards. Some polarising details too (chrome outside, painted plastics inside...) Sure lacks the street cred / presence offered by some competitors VW’s after-sales service can be a hit or miss. Many VW owners find it expensive too Missing some now-expected features such as 6 airbags in the MTs, a subwoofer, driving modes (sport), panoramic sunroof, 360-degree camera, electric driver's seat adjustment & rear window blinds Turbo-petrols are very sensitive to driving style. FE will drop drastically when you drive hard Kushaq's 'clever' touches are missing = no spot on top of the dashboard to place a deity, no smartphone holders on the front seatbacks, no ticket clip on the windshield, no elastic band in the doorpad to keep items in place, or even something as simple as the small reflective tapes on the doorpads This review has been jointly compiled with Gannu_1. Thanks to him for the expert observations! Introduction India 2.0 - the grand, ambitious, billion Euro plan that the Volkswagen Group formulated for the Indian market, is finally bearing fruit! Despite being the second-largest car manufacturer in the world, the VW group has been an ordinary performer in the Indian market. All it could do lately was to try and keep the old Polo platform relevant, while filling its portfolio with niche imports. Indians love SUVs / crossovers and VW didn’t have any in the affordable segments! The India 2.0 project aims to change all that and the future is claimed to be “SUVW” ! Skoda, the new group leader for India, has taken the first-mover advantage with the Kushaq, which was launched in June. But now, Volkswagen is finally in hustle mode to introduce its brand new car - the Taigun. Interestingly, this is the second time we are welcoming the Taigun nameplate in India, and it still manages to confuse us at times (Tiguan - Taigun). The Volkswagen Taigun (Volkswagen @ Auto Expo 2014) concept was one of the stars of the 2014 Delhi Auto Expo. It was expected to arrive in the Indian market in 2016 as a Ford EcoSport rival based on the UP platform and sporting a 1.0 TSi engine. What we have received now instead, is a localised version of the T-Cross, a new MQB A0-based crossover revealed in 2018. A truly international product that wears different faces for different markets (Europe, Brazil), the car receives jazzier styling for Asian markets. Known also as the Tacqua in China, the T-Cross has been heavily localised for India with the MQB-A0-IN platform and christened the Taigun (“the energy of the Taiga forest”, no Sanskrit here). Unlike the 2014 concept, the real deal enters the lucrative midsize SUV / crossover market rivaling the likes of the mighty Creta, Seltos and its own cousin - the Skoda Kushaq. In our opinion, Volkswagen also played it wise with the “GT” badge on the variants with the better performing 1.5 TSI motor. From the time of its launch in 2013, the Polo GT has been one of the rare success stories of a performance-oriented moniker in the Indian market, and the company is hoping to cash in on that GT-love now. This 4-cylinder motor produces 148 BHP & 250 Nm and comes paired with a 6-speed MT or a 7-speed AT (yes, the much loved, but dreaded DQ200 dual-clutch DSG). However, the mainstay of the range will be a 1.0L, 3-cylinder TSI motor that produces 113 BHP and 178 Nm and is paired with a 6-speed MT or torque-converter AT (will be more reliable than the DSG for sure). Both are excellent petrol engines, but it sucks that the VW-Skoda group didn't bother making their excellent 1.5L diesel BS6 compliant. Its direct competitor (the Creta) gets 60% of its sales in diesel and it doesn't help VW that petrol prices are at an all-time high! Volkswagen Taigun Price Prices of the Taigun are scheduled to be announced by September 2021. Just as we mentioned in the Kushaq review, the Taigun also has the potential to bring in volumes that the brand has never seen in the Indian market. However, its price & positioning will be key to that! Volkswagen may not be doing any favours to themselves by positioning it at a premium to the Skoda Kushaq, which is already priced near the higher end of the segment. The Kushaq itself has received a warm response in the Indian market - with bookings during the first month crossing 6,000 units. The Taigun is built in Pune (along with the Kushaq, Vento and Polo) with 95% localisation and we hope its priced right. At the time of writing this, variant details have not been confirmed and the final specs could change when the product is unveiled in the coming weeks. Exterior Design & Styling The Taigun looks unmistakably VW, albeit jazzed up a bit for the Asian audience. It sports the familiar VW family face with the new logo. Wish we had received the European face instead. But the market loves chrome and there may be more chrome on this car than any VW in recent times! Multiple sources had reported that this was done according to feedback from the Indian market. However, we would like to point out that the design is Asia-specific and not India-specific; it was first revealed in the Chinese market, back in 2018. We might be getting this chrome bar because the Chinese love it, just as is the case of the ever-growing BMW kidney grille designs. A gloss black wrap for the 'moustache' will be popular with BHPians. The same boldness is seen at the rear, where the LED tail lamps stretch from end to end and grab all the attention. Look at the car from the side though and you will appreciate the classic, clean VW character lines. However, just as with the Kushaq, the Taigun is on the smaller side and lacks the road presence of some of its rivals. Moreover, it doesn't feel as tall, which makes it look like a soft crossover rather than an SUV. In terms of external features, it gets LED daytime running lights, LED projector headlamps, plastic SUV-style cladding on the sides, 17-inch alloy wheels, contrast black roof and roof rails. The vehicle is available in 5 body colours with the option of black contrast roof on the top end trims - Curcuma Yellow, Wild Cherry Red, Carbon Steel Grey, Candy White and Reflex Silver. VAG should offer more colours IMHO - especially popular options like flash red and black. Variants with the 1.5 TSI EVO motor get the GT badge at the front, rear and side fenders. Build Quality, Fit & Finish The Taigun has a monocoque construction and is built on the MQB A0-IN platform, which is a variant of the modular MQB platform adapted for the Indian market. The car is solid & well-built. The doors & bonnet have a good deal of weight to them and there’s not much flex in the body panels. The sturdy doors shut with a satisfying thud, typical of European cars. Overall fit & finish are just as you'd expect from a European car. The panel gaps are even and the paint finish is rich (typical VW). Wheels & Tyres The top-trim GT DSG variant gets cool looking, 'aero' style, 17” Manila two-tone alloy wheels shod with 205/55 section Goodyear Assurance Triplemax 2 tyres. The wheel-tyre combo fills up the arches well and looks proportionate to the metal on top. However, my personal favourite is the 17"" alloy design on the top-end trims of the 1.0 TSI. Lower trims (including the GT manual transmission option) receive 16"" Belmont plain-silver alloy wheels shod with 205/60 section tyres. The Goodyear Assurance Triplemax 2 tyres provide acceptable grip levels on the 148 BHP Taigun. Still, we would definitely recommend an upgrade to a superior tyre model, particularly for those BHPians who enjoy spirited driving. Ground Clearance The official ground clearance figure of the Taigun has not been revealed yet, but we expect the car to have a laden ground clearance rating of 155 mm (unladen ground clearance of 188 mm), like its cousin - the Kushaq. Standard & Extended Warranty Volkswagen has earned a general impression among the public for expensive upkeep. However, with the Sarvottam 2.0 initiative under the India 2.0 project, Volkswagen aims to reduce ownership costs and improve customer experiences. That said, we recommend investing in the maximum extended warranty possible, typically 6 years on VWs. We also hope the ownership costs will be kept in check - considering the car is built in India with 95% localization. Exide / Sebang batteries, Bosch ECU, LED headlamps, etc. all feature made-in-India stickers and hopefully, this should keep the repair costs real. Safety The VW T-Cross has scored 5 stars in crash tests conducted by the Latin NCAP, Australian NCAP, as well as the more stringent Euro NCAP. This should not be assumed as applicable to the ""made for India"" MQB A0-IN platform. That being said, we would give the benefit of doubt to VW (even their old Polo got 4 stars in the NCAP crash tests). The company does have a reputation for selling safe & solid cars. It is also reassuring to note that the Taigun comes loaded with safety features such as 3-point seatbelts for all five occupants, up to 6 airbags, ESC, ABS, EBD, traction control, brake assist, electronic differential lock, hydraulic brake boosting, rollover protection, brake disc wiping, multi-collision brake, hill-hold, TPMS, ISOFIX child seat mounts, auto headlamps, auto wipers & more. The Seltos fared poorly in the GNCAP test & VW-Skoda should make full use of the opportunity by selling a safe car in the market...then bragging about it (like Tata does). Interior Cabin Design & Quality The cabin experience, though generally good, has some rough edges. The design looks the business in a typical VW fashion and is spacious as well as practical. The colour palette can be jazzed up depending on the variant, including an extreme combination of a cherry red painted dashboard and laser red ambient lighting. The new VW steering wheel, 8-inch virtual cockpit, tablet ICE, sunroof and touch a/c controls add some spice here. There are no soft-touch plastics anywhere, yet the interiors feel solidly put together without any major poorly finished areas. However, BHPians looking closer will find that the feel of plastics around the cabin isn't as nice as what we would have expected from VW for the price. When compared to its cousin, the Taigun feels better IMHO with clever use of a grey + beige colour scheme against gloss painted plastics. Better choice of seat material across the range - be it the fabric seats on the top end or lower variants and the leather upholstery on the 1.0 TSI top end - along with seemingly better fit and finish, elevate the cabin feel as compared to the Kushaq. That said, the cabin feel is just par for the price and will not make anyone go 'wow'. Space & Comfort Being a crossover, ingress & egress are easy. Cabin space is enough for 4 adults. In fact, rear legroom is better than we expected and a 6-footer passenger can sit behind an equally tall driver. Headroom is also satisfactory front & back, although the rear seat is on the narrower side. Two fit adults & a kid or two healthy adults is the max that it will accommodate. If you're talking only about adults, the Taigun is a 4-seater car. The driver’s seat doesn't get lumbar adjustment, yet it is supportive enough. It has healthy side bolstering for support through the corners. The seat can slide back far enough even for tall drivers to feel comfortable. The leather upholstery is of acceptable quality. The top-end 1.5 TSI DSG variant gets cloth upholstered seats, but the front seats lack ventilation & electric adjustments, even for the driver's seat!!! The top-end 1.0 TSI variant however gets leatherette-based upholstery with seat ventilation. Go figure! Driving Position & Ergonomics The ergonomics are spot on with everything exactly where you would expect it to be, within easy reach of the driver. For a European car, we must say that the cabin is as user-friendly as any Japanese or Korean model (including a wide footwell). There’s actually not a single ergonomic error to be found! The steering is nice to hold, it gets rake + reach adjustment and the frontal visibility is good. You sit inside the car with the bonnet at around the chest level. What helps is a proper view out of the cabin - the bonnet being visible to tall drivers. On the downside, we feel that the high-set dashboard will bother short drivers in terms of visibility unless they use the seat height adjustment. While on the topic of visibility, we will state that the ORVMs should have been a size wider; their height is fine, but the width should've been more. Cabin Storage The Taigun offers a very practical cabin with ample storage spots including a large, solid-feeling glovebox and a deep but narrow storage bin under the driver armrest. Door pads get accommodating bottle holders and room for other miscellaneous items. Cupholders and cubby holes have been provided in the centre console as well. We like the vertical slot on the centre console for the passenger's smartphone, while the driver's is being charged on the wireless pad. The front seatbacks have deep pockets. If we were to nitpick, although half expected, it was a bit disappointing to see many of Skoda's 'Simply Clever' features missed out in this cabin. The spot on top of the dashboard to place a deity, the smartphone holders on the front seatbacks, that nifty ticket / FASTag clip on the windshield, sunglass holders on the non-sunroof variants, elastic band in the door pad to keep items in place, or even something as simple as the small reflective tapes on the doorpads etc. are missing. Air-Conditioning The mid and top-spec variants get a ""Climatronic"" climate control system with an Air Care (purifier) function and a touch control panel. While we usually hate touch-panels for the air-con, we won't complain about this one. Initially, you’ll have to take your eyes off the road to control these settings. However, once you get used to it, the design is such that, even without taking your eyes off the road, you can slide your finger into the perfectly curved slot and move it left / right to decrease / increase the temperature / fan speed. Air vents have been provided at the rear. Due to the overcast conditions present during our media drive days, we cannot really comment on the effectiveness of the system on a hot day. Features Unique & Noteworthy Features The Taigun comes with most of the necessary features (including a sunroof, virtual cockpit and a 10-inch touchscreen head-unit with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay). It also gets paddle shifters, ambient lighting (white coloured in the 1.0 variants and red coloured in the sporty GT variants), wireless phone charging and ventilated seats (only in the 1.0 top-end variant). However, some goodies such as a panoramic sunroof, a subwoofer for the audio system, electrically adjustable driver's seat and a 360-degree camera are missing. The Korean siblings provide these. Variant details have not been confirmed at the time of publishing this review. However, it was unofficially confirmed by VW officials at the event that the Taigun GT will come in two variants - a mid-spec MT variant and a top end DSG automatic variant. Interestingly, this strategy is quite the opposite of the general market (followed also by the Skoda Kushaq) that the top-end automatics miss out on features to avoid sticker shock. While this VW strategy helps make the 1.5 engine more accessible, it also leaves it with a barebones feature list for the price. We hope the error is fast corrected & VW eventually launches the Taigun MT in the top variant. Below are some of the features missing in the GT MT as against the GT DSG trim: Side and curtain airbags Cruise Control Halogen headlights with LED DRLs, instead of LED projector headlamps Smaller, 16-inch, plain-silver alloy wheels with 205/60 R16 tyres Virtual cockpit Ventilated seats (present in the 1.0 top-end. Inexplicably missing in the GT DSG too!) Auto-dimming IRVM Auto headlamps Sunroof Black contrast roof Matte plastic for B and C-pillars instead of better-looking gloss plastic Keyless entry, chrome window-line, chrome-lined door handles. Heck, even the driver side door doesn't get a slot for the key, nor a keyless entry request sensor! Is Skoda sending DSG customers over to the parent company and VW's reciprocating with manual customers? Audio System & Sound Quality The mid and top-spec variants of the Taigun get a 10"" touchscreen HU. The unit is snappy to use, has a sharp display and a user-friendly interface (but lacks physical buttons). The display is a fingerprint magnet and reflects everything around it - our review car had so many smudges at the end of a drive! Physical knobs for the power and volume buttons would have been nice to have. The UI is slick and there was no lag. The infotainment system gets WiFi in addition to Bluetooth and supports wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The system can be used to adjust various settings such as the interior and exterior lights, mirrors, wipers, ESC (electronic stability control), instrument cluster, service settings, central locking system, valet settings etc. Unlike the 'Skoda Sound' system on the Kushaq, the Volkswagen system relies on 6 speakers even for the top-spec variants. No subwoofer, sadly. While it sounds good for an OEM system and will please most users, there is a limit to the lower frequencies that can be achieved without a subwoofer. Bass lovers will miss out on the low-frequency punch of the Kushaq. The system lacks a separate amplifier or a dedicated subwoofer which are a big miss considering the competition equips their cars with high-end setups from reputed audio equipment manufacturers. A conscious cost-tradeoff by Volkswagen here? Not cool, because many of us aren't comfortable upgrading the ICE in the after-market (The Downside of High-End Audio Installs). Rear Passengers Rear Seat Comfort & Space Ingress & egress are easy. The rear bench is placed at a decent height as well. Legroom is better than we expected! I'm 5'11"" and had legroom to spare when I sat behind my own driving position. Two 6-footers will be able to sit one behind the other & headroom is adequate too, thanks to the scooped out roof liner. However, the seat width is too less for three adults to feel comfortable. It's more suitable for two adults and a kid. If the two adults are on the heavier side, then it's just them, no kid. The cushioning is adequate and the bench offers extremely good under-thigh support. All 3 seats get adjustable headrests. Rear occupants get a/c vents and a couple of Type-C USB ports for their smartphones. Boot Space Although not officially revealed, the boot space of the Taigun should be around the same as the Kushaq - 385 litres, which on paper, is more comparable to sub-4 meter crossovers like the Sonet (392L) & WR-V (363L) rather than the Seltos (433L) or Duster (475L). That said, the boot is well-shaped and there is enough depth too. Weekend holiday luggage for your family should fit in. The rear seat splits in a 60:40 ratio for when you need that flexibility, but the boot floor is far from flat! The loading lip is high & you will have to lift your bags to take them out. The boot gets a single halogen light on the RHS, a well-shaped parcel tray and a couple of bag hooks.", 9th August 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,"17,111","73,249"
1, CrAzY dRiVeR , 10:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Driving the Volkswagen Taigun 1.5L Turbo Petrol MT 1.5L turbo-petrol engine makes 148 BHP @ 5,000 - 6,000 rpm and 250 Nm @ 1,600 - 3,500 rpm: While all variants of the Taigun come with an improved version of the Polo's 1.0L, 3-cylinder TSI engine, mated to a 6-speed manual transmission (MQ200) and some have a 6-speed torque-converter AT too (AQ250), the top-end GT variants also get the 1.5L, 4-cylinder TSI engine, which was used in the T-Roc. It is matched to a 6-speed MT (MQ281) and a 7-speed DSG (DQ200). The engine produces 148 BHP & 250 Nm. This makes it more powerful than the Korean twins' 1.4L turbo-petrol (138 BHP & 242 Nm), but not the Duster 1.3L's 154 BHP & 254 Nm. There is no diesel engine on offer. It's very sad that VAG has decided not to make its brilliant 1.5L TDI BS6 compliant. Those with high usage will be disappointed, especially with petrol now costing over 100-bucks a litre! Internationally, the T-Cross is also available with a 1.6L TDI motor that produces 94 BHP and 250 Nm. Throttle response is satisfactory and the Taigun rolls off without a fuss. Once on the move, the 1.5 TSI provides good driveability. The motor can pull from as low as 1,000 rpm, although it's more comfortable above 1,200+ rpm and alive above 1,500. The bottom end is good, because of which, the car didn't even break a sweat climbing a gradual incline on the 4-lane highway in 6th gear at 60 km/h. Importantly, this engine pulls much better than the 1.0 TSI from low revs. At the end of the day, you can't argue with displacement and this is 50% bigger in size than its smaller sibling. Downshifts aren't required frequently. The light electric steering, compact size of the car, taller seating, good ergonomics and excellent frontal view make the Taigun superb to drive in the city. Out on the open road, the power on tap makes the 1.5 TSI a fast performer and a whole lot of fun. VW says it'll do 0 - 100 in 9.1 seconds on a good day and we totally buy that (Skoda claims a significantly quicker 8.6 seconds for the Kushaq!). However, it doesn't have that crazy streak of the 1.0L. While the smaller 1.0 TSI is wild and begs to be driven hard, the 1.5L is more mature with its power delivery. This 1.5 TSI employs a long stroke configuration compared to the near square nature of the 1.0 - think of the 1.5L as the grownup bigger brother to the mischievous brat 1.0 TSI. Even torque steer is extremely well-controlled for a 148 BHP FWD car. The 1.5L TSI is very tractable and pulls cleanly. Driving it on the highway is an addictive experience and you will find yourself driving fast, even if you didn't intend to. To overtake, just drop a gear and floor it...the strong mid-range will ensure you fly past the slower vehicle. The engine revs in a linear fashion till ~6,600 rpm. In terms of cruiseability, the Taigun can run at triple-digit speeds all day long without breaking into a sweat. The TSI spins at a relaxed ~2,000 rpm at 100 km/h in 6th gear, and just a notch below 2,500 rpm at 120 km/h. Beyond 5,000 rpm, however, the engine starts getting a bit boomy. Summary = this is overall a fast, smooth & lovable engine. Enthusiasts will relish the MQ281 6-speed MT. It is slick, with short throws and well-defined gates. The gears are closely stacked together (try shifting from 4th to 5th and you'll see). The clutch, though light, is quite springy and you need to carefully modulate it in stop-and-go traffic to avoid stalling the car. Its travel range is longer than we'd like too. This trait of the clutch gets irritating in bumper to bumper traffic. Driving the Taigun 1.5L DSG Automatic The 1.5L engine also comes with the fast & smooth, but notorious 7-speed DQ200 DSG gearbox: I must say this - as fun as it was to drive the manual, the 1.5 DSG, to me, was the perfect engine-gearbox combination for the Taigun. Fast and effortless at any legal speed, the powertrain compliments the ride and handling characteristics of the car beautifully. The combo makes the Taigun an effortless cross-country mile-muncher, if fuel prices are not a concern . Slot into D mode, take your foot off the brake pedal and the Taigun slowly creeps forward at ~5 km/h. This behaviour will be highly appreciated in city traffic conditions. It is quite unlike the 1.0 TSI AT (as per my experience with the Polo), which feels more aggressive. Drive with a light foot and the gearbox moves up the ratios pretty quickly. Impressively, you won't feel these shifts as the transition is very smooth. While the automatic transmission makes the Taigun very easy to drive in the city, when crawling in slow traffic (1st - 3rd gears), you will experience a little jerkiness, which is a typical DSG trait. Under harsh sunlight, the display on the gear selector isn't bright enough, but the virtual cockpit shows the mode as well as the exact gear engaged (in M, S and even D modes). In the city, the 1.5 motor's healthy bottom end helps you get around effortlessly. Throttle response is good and the Taigun moves smoothly. Add to that, the direct injection and turbocharger ensure that the engine isn't lethargic at any speed. There's always enough power on tap to accelerate or overtake quickly. Out on the highway is when things go from good to great! This is easily among the most fun-to-drive crossovers for 2 million bucks. You'll find yourself addicted to flooring the throttle whenever there's an empty stretch of road. Outright performance is excellent and the strong mid-range takes care of all the overtaking you need to do. The downshifts are quick (not as fast as upshifts though) and the gearbox responds well to throttle inputs. The 7th ratio gives the Taigun DSG long legs on the highway. And touring you must do - this car is built for long road-trips. In summary, the 1.5 TSI DSG is a jewel of a combination that will keep you happy at low revs & high, and in the city as well as on the highway. Other than its reliability woes, this is one of the best AT gearboxes sold in India. I found the 1.5L TSI to be too boomy at high revs though. If you are continuously driving hard and / or in ‘S” mode, your passengers will complain about the prominent boominess. It is part motor, and part compromised insulation levels. The sound gets very annoying if you are driving aggressively for a longer duration. Tap the left paddle for a downshift and manual mode is engaged. The ECU blips the throttle to match the revs, and holds the gear till near the redline. This gets addictive, especially during overtakes! However, even in manual mode, the DSG will upshift above ~6,000 rpm and also downshift below ~1,000 rpm. We feel this is way too conservative - the MT revs to ~6600 rpm. Manual mode will also ignore wrong gear selections which put the engine out of the above rpm ranges. Long hold the paddles to revert back to auto mode. Cruising around in D mode, one won't even notice the gears being shifted. They are damn smooth. The kickdown response time is quick enough and you will never feel that the gearbox is hunting for gears either. It's in the right ratio almost all the time. When you are in the mood to drive the car aggressively, engage Sport mode. In S, the gearbox downshifts to keep the car in the power band, holds the ratios longer and lets the punchy midrange do all the heavy lifting required. Out on the open road, you will find it hard to resist the urge to go hard on the throttle. The Taigun is simply brilliant to drive! Cruise control works seamlessly with the automatic transmission. After slowing down from a 100 km/h cruise to stop at a toll booth, we hit 'resume' just after and the car smoothly accelerated from around 10 km/h to the ton. On the flip side, we have scarily serious concerns over the DSG's long-term reliability. Just search on Team-BHP and you will see story after story of DQ200 failures & breakdowns. VW insists they have fixed the problem, but we aren't convinced at all. This gearbox has inherent design defects IMHO. Some BHPians who can't resist the DSG have mentally relegated themselves to 2 breakdowns over 8 - 10 years of ownership. Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH) The 1.5L TSI is overall refined. It's a lot smoother than the 1.0 TSI which has some 3-cylinder vibrations, noises, groans & growls. That said, even the 1.5L TSI gets very boomy past 5,000 rpm. We found tyre & road noise at 110 - 120 km/h on concrete expressways / rumble strips to be higher than expected in a car with premium aspirations. On the other hand, wind noise is nicely controlled at expressway speeds. Mileage & Fuel Economy ARAI fuel economy figures for the Taigun have not yet been revealed. Drive the TSIs with a light foot and they should give you acceptable FE. Turbo-petrols are very sensitive to throttle input though; drive it hard and you'll see the tank needle drop fast. VW has given the 1.5L Taigun Active Cylinder Technology. When cruising calmly on the open road, the ECU shuts off cylinders 2 and 3 to reduce fuel consumption. This 2-cylinder mode will lead to good long distance FE, that is if you drive calmly (which is tough in the TSI). While the Taigun GT is generally too much fun to let you see the ACT getting engaged, it really shows up when cruising, especially with cruise control engaged. Setting cruise control at 80 km/h will see ACT engaged predominantly with excellent highway efficiency figures. But that's not all. Even on a long 120 km/h cruise, the cylinders get deactivated on flat ground and at the hint of the slightest slopes. Despite checking to the best of my abilities, I just could not pick up any change in noise or vibrations when the cylinders were engaged or disengaged. It's seamless. When the car is running on 2 cylinders, it's displayed in the instrument cluster: Suspension Volkswagen officials mention that the suspension hardware, which is the same as the Kushaq, is tuned slightly differently in the Taigun. Although my drive experience with the Kushaq is not as extensive as with the Taigun, I feel that the difference (if any) isn't drastic, which is not a bad thing! In short, the setup is brilliant and will be loved by both, regular drivers and enthusiasts alike. Ride Comfort The Taigun's ride quality can be termed as mature & compliant. We have to say this is the perfect suspension tune that VW has chosen. It is neither too soft (Hector) nor too stiff (Seltos). Owners will find the ride quality to be endearing. It offers good comfort levels in the city, on broken village roads & on highways alike. For the most part, it does its job in silence, but sharp ruts do find their way into the cabin and that results in an occasional ""clunk"". This was more prominent in our automatic car with the 17"" rims & 33 PSI tyre pressures (verified). The ride quality of the manual variant with the 16"" rims was slightly better with lesser noise and a rounded off feel over the sharp stuff. Handling & Dynamics As expected of a VW, the Taigun has sorted road manners. It has excellent straight-line stability and composure at high speeds. In fact, 120 km/h feels more like 90 - 100 km/h. You can confidently maintain high speeds on the expressway. Driving the Taigun on winding roads was fun, with the front end seemingly eager to turn. Sure, there is body roll, but it's a family crossover at the end of the day. Nothing too alarming, and it takes high-speed expressway curves at cruising speeds without breaking a sweat. The tyres are the same Goodyears used on the Kushaq. Grip levels were fair. Although, for the enthusiast, we would still recommend upgrading to better rubber as these tyres were squealing under hard cornering @ 85 km/h! Steering The EPS feels direct & sharp. It is light at parking & city speeds which is now the market's preference. Our complaint is that, at 100 - 110 km/h, it is still a level too light and comfort-oriented for enthusiasts' tastes. We wish VW had firmed things up more for highway speeds. A user-selectable 'Sport' driving mode that stiffens things up would be nice. Braking While its main rivals, the Creta and Seltos, get all-wheel disc brakes, the Taigun makes do with discs at the front and drums at the rear. The brake pedal is well calibrated and feels sharp to use. In fact, we felt that the brakes of the Taigun were more confidence-inspiring than those of the Korean twins. The braking is powerful and we felt confident with them on our highway run. Niggles & Problems VW is generally known for expensive maintenance bills and the occasional major breakdown. Truth is, many owners have suffered multiple breakdowns, especially with the DQ200 DSG gearbox. Even apart from the gearbox, don't expect a Toyota or Maruti kind of ownership experience over 5 - 10 years. Take the extended warranty without a second thought, and be sure to get the car serviced on time. For its part, VW is trying to improve its brand image with the Sarvottam 2.0 initiative, and hopefully, there will be maintenance packages etc. announced during the launch, but the dealers are the same, the cars are complicated & the parts are expensive. Those buying the 1.5L MT or 1.0L AT (torque converter) / MT might enjoy better long-term reliability than owners of the 1.5L DSG. A fast and effortless mile-muncher: There's no insulation sheet under the bonnet. The motor is generally refined, but more insulation might have helped reduce the boomy nature above 5,000 rpm: No underbody protection is sad given our road conditions and VW's high repair costs: Dual-tone horn sounds effective, but is not the wind tone type generally expected in a VAG car: ", 9th August 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,"17,111","73,249"
2, CrAzY dRiVeR , 10:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Volkswagen Taigun Exterior Images Front is unmistakably VW (OK, the chrome is an obvious elephant in the room and we'll discuss it later). This is the first product from the company's India line-up to sport the brand's new logo (in case anyone is wondering how to easily identify the new logo, the 'W' doesn't touch the circle anymore). Seen here is the Taigun 1.5 GT DSG in the top-end trim and painted in bright Curcuma Yellow... ...and the GT 1.5 TSI manual in the mid-spec trim, finished in Wild Cherry Red: The rear too is very ""VW"", but as with the front, it is spiced up for the Asian markets. Horizontal end-to-end design elements lend the car a wider and more planted stance: It is from the sides that one will truly appreciate these classic VW lines. Notice the crease that emerges from the front GT badging and merges with the tail lamps: While we await the official information regarding the dimensions, it has been revealed that the wheelbase of 2,651 mm is unchanged from the Kushaq. Dimensionally, the Taigun is smaller than its main rivals, the Creta and the Seltos, but it has a longer wheelbase (the Korean twins have a wheelbase of 2,610 mm). Small size doesn't give it much street presence: Since the Taigun doesn't need to stick to the sub-4m rules, the bumpers protrude on either side. This should help protect the metal work in city driving conditions where minor altercations happen, and gets a thumbs up from us: Smart all-LED headlamp clusters on the top variant consist of daytime running lights, LED projectors for the low beam & main beam and LED turn indicators (not dynamic/sequential type). Unconventionally large halogen foglamps sit below the headlights and come with a cornering function: A look at the smart detailing inside the headlamp cluster. No branding here: DRLs are bright and prominent, even during the day: 1.5 GT Manual comes with halogen headlamps. LED daytime running lamps sit at the bottom of the cluster with halogen indicators on the sides: Bonnet has subtle character humps and ends sharply at the front. The signature VW grille looks good & has a three-layer chrome lining on the top-spec variants: 1.5 GT Manual variant in the lower spec trim receives a slightly different grille, with less chrome. Same is the case with lower trims of the 1.0 TSI as shown here: Time to address the elephant in the room - the generous use of chrome upfront. As mentioned earlier, this has probably been done based on market feedback - the Chinese market more so - even though ours loves chrome as well! 'Chrome delete' will be a popular mod with BHPians. Front bumper features a wide air dam with a black honeycomb mesh grille with a faux silver skid plate below for that 'SUVW' stance. But seriously, that garish chrome! It's as if the Taigun went jewellery shopping just before its unveil: Rain-sensing wipers have their spindles & washers tucked under the bonnet: 1.5 TSI variants sport unique piano black panels with chrome ""GT"" lettering. I find these tastefully done, whereas Gannu preferred a cleaner look to the fenders. No such badges for the 1.0 petrol: ORVMs with integrated blinkers and auto-folding function. This setting can be changed from the infotainment unit: Subtle 'Volkswagen' branding on the B-pillars. On the top-end variants, the pillars are finished in gloss black and sport chrome inserts on the door handles, with request sensors on both front doors: On the lower trims (like the GT Manual pictured here), the pillars are finished in matte black. They miss out on the chrome window belt line and also the chrome inserts on the door handles: In the lower variants, the driver side door handle doesn't get request sensors (key slot is probably hidden behind the plastic cap on the left)! Looks neat and we love it from a design perspective. So clean & pure: Roof slopes down towards the rear, while the window line rises. It starts rising sharply just before the C-pillar to form a nice kink: That's not a quarter glass on the C-Pillar, but merely a piano black filler giving a glass-like effect. Also note the subtle design difference in the chrome element VW has adopted for the Taigun as compared to its cousin: Lovely cuts & creases, done in a classy manner accomplished only by the German brands: Subtle crease runs low on the doors. Black plastic cladding for that ""crossover"" stance: 17"" 6.5J Manila alloy wheels of the top-spec trim shod with 205/55 section Goodyear Assurance Triplemax 2 tyres fill up the wheel wells nicely. These alloys are diamond cut and have an 'aero' element when seen closely. While some markets have the option of custom coloured 'Manila' wheels on the T-Cross, BHPians would agree that we fancy these good old monochrome ones more than orange and green! That said, don't miss those sweet red brake calipers on the top-spec GT DSG trim: It's the top-spec 1.0 TSI trims that receive the best alloys IMHO! Once again, 17"" and shod with 205/55 section Goodyear Assurance Triplemax 2 rubber: GT manual variant gets 16"" Belmont alloy wheels shod with 205/60 section Goodyear Assurance Triplemax 2 tyres. Looks very characterless, but this 100 PCD setup should provide a lot of upgrade options. The 16"" cars should ride cushier than the 17"" ones: Even the fast 1.5L variants do not get rear disc brakes. Still, braking performance is strong and reassuring: Full plastic cladding in the front wheel well... ...as well as the rear: Silver roof rails enhance the vehicle's crossover appearance. Top-end variants get a contrast black roof and a fair-sized regular sunroof, but not a panoramic unit like the Creta's: VW provides functional roof rails. To prove this point, they even had a display Taigun with a bicycle rack on top. Sweeeeet attention to detail - that's not just any bicycle, but a 2021 VW GTI hardtail mountain bike: Rear spoiler is a two-piece unit with a metal portion on the inside and a plastic portion on the outside. The two portions are separated by a crease, very evident on this dual-tone colour scheme. Black sharkfin antenna sits at the end of the roof section: Infinity LED tail-lamp cluster stretches end-to-end and provides a distinct / funky visual identity to the Taigun. Looks very Audi’esque. They get black outer diffusers with chrome elements on the sides to break the monotony. The Taigun does not get rear fog lamps: A closer look at the ""love it or hate it, but can't ignore it"" detailing: Looks more appealing once darkness falls: Large reflective strip underneath, shines like a gigantic neon board! Those following a Taigun won't mistake it for any other car: Ugghh! The conventional, frame-type wiper looks so damn ugly and out of place on this car! Oh come on VW, even the old Polo gets a neat, frameless wiper! Windscreen washer sits up, to the RHS of the high mounted stop lamp: Higher variant gets a reversing camera which is placed next to the electromagnetic boot release. It provides a poor quality feed and does not support dynamic guidelines - both points are unacceptable in the segment: Taigun branding placed centrally with smart fonts. GT badge of the 1.5 TSI variants lets other road users know why its harder to catch up with this crossover than the rest: Thick chrome bar (ugghh) at the rear as well, surrounding a fake silver skid plate. 3 parking sensors have been provided, while slim reflectors sit higher on either side: Twin exhaust pipes on the left: While all the cars in the test fleet were painted in the signature colours of Curcuma Yellow and Wild Cherry Red, a display car showcased the Reflex Silver option. I'm not a fan of silver, yet will admit that it looks good on the Taigun. Actually, most VWs look hot in silver, thanks to the brand's design lines: ", 9th August 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,"17,111","73,249"
3, CrAzY dRiVeR , 10:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Volkswagen Taigun Interior Images Good-looking dashboard with large, gloss painted (red & grey) inserts running from end to end. There are no soft-touch plastics, but the cabin does feel well built: The windscreen is big and the seating position is somewhat high. This means one can get a very clear view of the road ahead, with taller drivers getting a clean view of the bonnet too. On the downside, we feel that the high-set dashboard will bother shorter drivers in terms of visibility: The new VW steering wheel debuts in India with the Taigun and feels good. Both the mid and top-spec variants get a leather-wrapped steering with a satin finish trim, but the material selection is different. Choose your everyday view wisely, for there are a few combinations on offer. Here is the GT DSG top-end with gloss grey dashboard inserts, perforated leather for the steering wheel and a red GT theme for the instrument console: Thinking of ordering your GT in red? Get matching red painted inserts for the cabin as well to go with the red theme of the center console. Note the missing perforated leather and cruise control buttons in the manual transmission variants: Step into one of the 1.0 top-end trims and you miss out on the perforated leather for the steering wheel, but you do get a nice shade of blue for the instrument cluster: GT variants get attention-grabbing red ambient lighting that adds to the sporty feel of the cabin. It goes well with the painted cherry red inserts of the red car: 1.0 TSI variants get white ambient lighting, as in the Kushaq: LHS buttons are for cruise control commands (there are also volume controls down below), while the ones on the RHS are for the virtual cockpit (along with the change tracks below). Eagle-eyed BHPians will be intrigued by that innermost button on the LHS side, as we were, only to be greeted by a 'button without function' warning message on the cockpit . Who says Germans don't joke? Left stalk houses light / indicator controls and on the right is the wiper stalk. The Taigun is equipped with auto wipers which are on by default: Unlike in the Kushaq, the engine start button is located just ahead of the gear shifter: Old school, classy, conventional dials on the lower variants of the Taigun, including the 1.5 GT Manual. The buttons to check the service interval, set the time and display the trip meter are the same as the ones used in the Polo: Dials backlit in white and sporty red backlit needles feel more timeless as compared to the ones on the Kushaq. Analogue fuel and temperature gauges have been provided too: The much-hyped ""virtual cockpit"" makes an appearance on the higher variants. Looks brilliant at first glance: But soon, you realize that we don't get the full deal. The 8-inch virtual cockpit provided here instead of the full fat 10-inch unit means that the cluster just isn't wide enough and can only display either the speedo or rpm dials. Not both! Backlit blanks on either side only to complete the visual package: And the rpm view: There is also the option of a full-digital console, where either end can be customised to display the parameter you require. These parameters include average speed, gear display, oil temperature, audio, telephone, economy, average economy, distance / time, etc: The MID also shows the exact door which is open. It covers the tailgate and bonnet too (great to see as the bonnet is skipped by 99% of cars out there): Conventional a/c vents as compared to the Kushaq feel sturdier and, we feel, should receive much less criticism: Typical European headlamp and foglamp controls. The Taigun gets automatic headlamps on the top spec variants. All-black knob here looks too basic & cheap. We would've liked some silver metal highlights or bordering: Bonnet release is located on the right of the footwell: Door pads are mostly black with a small grey portion, and a painted grey insert around the chrome door handle. This looks very boring & plain Jane to our eyes (check out Kia's more interesting approach here & here). The armrest is wrapped in leather, but not all that soft to rest your elbows on longer journeys: The usual set of backlit window and mirror controls. Driver's window gets auto up & down with an anti-pinch function. We also found this plastic panel to be low rent: Wide door pockets can hold a lot more than just a water bottle: A slot to put in longer items, such as an umbrella: Branded aluminium scuff plates provided: GT variants miss out on ventilated leather seats; imagine how customers paying more money don't get this super useful cooling feature. That said, Volkswagen has better fabric options than Skoda across the range. Center armrest is useful + adjustable: A closer look at the fabric seats of the GT. Don't miss the contrast red stitching: The perforated leather seat upholstery of the top-end 1.0 variants. Perforated material is mandatory for the seat's cooling function. The quality of materials used is good: Lower variants of the 1.0 TSi get different fabric covers: Even the top variant does not get electric seat adjustment. Lumbar adjust is not provided, but back support is fine. The seat offers a healthy adjustment range (fore & aft and height) and even a 6-footer will be comfortable: The center armrest has a soft leather cladding with white stitching (strange misfit, as the seats get contrast red stitching!!!). It is adjustable and placed at a comfortable height: Seatbelts aren't adjustable for height. Still, the position is neutral and no one will have an issue: In the manual transmission variants, the ABC pedals are well spaced out, as in the Kushaq. The top-spec GT DSG trim gets these sporty aluminium pedals. A very useable dead pedal has also been provided: Bundled 3D mats have a raised lip on the sides, offer a snug fit and are easy to clean. They look premium: Music is played through 6 speakers, including one mid-bass unit on each door and tweeters on the A-Pillars. No fancy branding for the audio here. Big miss as compared to the Kushaq is a subwoofer: We feel that VW has gone for form over function with the ORVMs. We would have liked them to be a size bigger in terms of width. They should have extended out more and you will find yourself craning your neck when joining the main road, or when taking a U-turn. Notice how the driver can see the blinker from the inside (like in many other VAG cars): IRVM gets a slim frame and an auto-dimming function. It is wide enough to cover the rear windshield. Headrests (including one for the 5th occupant) do restrict visibility to some extent: Like most crossovers, the rearward view is average at best. Because of the thick C-pillars and protruding headrests, it’s better to rely on the reversing camera and parking sensors: The center fascia hosts a 10” touchscreen at the top, which provides almost identical functions as in the Kushaq. There is liberal use of painted grey inserts around the center console: On red cars, the cherry red theme is carried over to the center console as well. 6-speed gear-shifter in the 1.5L GT is absolutely superb with smooth, short throws and well-defined gates: Mid and top-spec variants get a Climatronic climate control system with an ""Air Care"" air purifier and a touch-and-slide function for adjusting the temperature and blower speed. Even on the move, the sliders are easy to operate without taking your eyes off the road as they are placed in a perfectly recessed area. Buttons for the idling start/stop system, hazard lamps and ventilated seats are located above. Ventilated seats sure are a boon in our hot climatic conditions, but VW has inexplicably limited the feature only to the top-spec 1.0 TSI trim: GT MT and lower-spec versions miss out on keyless start-stop. Instead, a 12V socket is provided ahead of the gear lever on the RHS. The Taigun is equipped with a wireless charging pad along with two Type-C USB ports as well. Gloss black plastic trim is prone to scratches: The passenger's side of the dashboard gets a shiny painted panel with contrast finishing in the center. While the GT variants get a pseudo carbon-fibre finish (no texture here)... ...the 1.0 gets a glossy texture with a different pattern (personally, I think this looks much better than the pseudo carbon-fibre finish): ] Bird's eye view of the center console. Cupholders get a rubber base with grips to hold the bottle in place so that the driver can open it with a single hand: Ahead of the cupholders is a deep slot to place a smartphone: Beneath the center armrest is a deep, but narrow storage compartment: The glovebox is large, cooled and accommodating, but it lacks a light. While the glovebox's opening & closing actions feel very solid & satisfying, a softer damping action for the lid would have lent it a premium feel: The roof bezel holds two individual lights, sunroof controls and the Bluetooth mic: Sunvisors have a basic design, yet they don’t feel flimsy. The driver-side unit merely gets a flap to hold slips (no mirror or illumination), while the passenger-side piece gets a vanity mirror, but there's no cover or light provided. We found the roof liner quality to be budget-grade and more suitable to a B-segment hatchback, not a crossover that's going to cost much higher: The Taigun gets an option of up to 6 airbags in total, including dual front airbags, side airbags (no seat covers please) and curtain airbags. We have mentioned it earlier and feel it needs to be mentioned again - Volkswagen should consider giving a top-end 6 airbag version on both the MT and AT variants of the Taigun: While some of the competition offers a panoramic sunroof, the Taigun makes do with a regular unit, which is fairly sized for the cabin: Simple flippy key feels good to hold. On the flip side (pun intended), it is from the last generation VW cars (the newer ones get the gloss black keyfobs like the one bundled in the new Octavia), looks basic and misses out on features such as remote engine start which some of the competition offers: Two visible fit and finish issues were noticed in an otherwise well-finished cabin. Call it nitpicking, but since the launch is still a few weeks away, I hope Volkswagen takes note of these problems and fixes them: ", 9th August 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,"17,111","73,249"
4, CrAzY dRiVeR , 10:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Rear doorpads have an identical theme to the front ones. Only mid-bass speakers are housed in them, no tweeters. The front and rear doors, both, open in a triple-stage action. Wide door pockets can hold a water bottle and other knick-knacks with ease: Legroom is surprisingly healthy and even two 6-footers can sit one behind the other: A glance at the minimum / maximum legroom available: I'm 5'11"", with a good build and had knee space to spare when I sat behind my own driving position. The backrest is set at a comfortable angle and the bench is supportive. Under-thigh support is satisfactory, as evident in this picture. I had ~3 inches of headroom to spare: The center armrest is positioned at a comfortable height. It is wide & soft, and comes with two cupholders. The way the fabric is wrapped on it though leaves a lot to be desired. Look closely and you'll see lots of rough edges...as if it was done at a local aftermarket shop: Rear seat has nice contours for support. While three 3-point seatbelts and three adjustable headrests have been provided, the rear seat is better suited for 2 adults and a kid (rather than 3 healthy adults). If it is two overweight adults, even a kid cannot be accommodated. Also, the middle area of the backrest protrudes (due to the armrest) and the seat base is elevated in the center. The headrests have a firm compound: Rear bench gets ISOFIX child seat anchors on both sides: Window line rises toward the rear. Shorter occupants will find this restricting their view outside. The rear glass rolls down all the way. While the bottom half is dark-coloured, a lighter top ensures one doesn't feel stuffy inside: The top-end variants get tinted windows, though they are barely noticeable. Darker tints, as seen in the Polo 1.0 TSI, sure would have been welcome in these sunfilm-less times! Both front seats have deep seatback pockets, but miss out on the very handy smartphone pockets provided in the Kushaq: Two Type-C USB charging ports are provided below the simple rear vents. Wish VW had provided at least one Type-A port which is more widely used today: Spring-loaded grab handles get coat hooks. They are nicely recessed inside the roof moulding, but have almost no damping in the return action which robs them of a premium feel. Not the VW we know: Floor hump is medium-sized, but still, this isn't a car in which a 5th adult will be welcomed: Rear light console is sharp looking! It consists of two individual LED lights: Whitish roof liner is scooped out where headroom is required: Although the specs have not been disclosed, boot space should be similar to the Kushaq's 385 liters. On paper, this is more comparable to sub-4 meter crossovers like the Sonet (392L) & WR-V (363L) rather than the Seltos (433) or Duster (475L). That said, useable space seems to be on par (or better than) its direct competitors. A wide tray with a prominent border has been provided: The boot is well-shaped and weekend holiday luggage for your family should easily fit in: Practical bag hooks on both sides of the boot: The boot light and first-aid kit are on the right: Tools are stored neatly in the spare wheel well. No spare wheel-mounted subwoofer here, as in the Kushaq. No subwoofer is a big, big miss at this price point. Spare is a 16” rim with a 205/55 section tyre: Rear seats can split in a 60:40 ratio. Folding the seatbacks down should give you around the same cargo capacity as the Kushaq. Floor is far from flat though: Tailgate gets partial cladding on the inside: A plastic piece has been provided to pull the tailgate down.

6, Gannu_1 , 10:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"First off, I must thank GTO for giving me this break and Crazy Driver (Sujai) for tagging along for this drive. Guys, Sujai and I had a proper B-L-A-S-T during this media drive especially with the brutal 1.5 TSI + DSG combo, putting it through its paces on the beautiful 4-laned roadway from Udaipur to Pindwara! The grin on our faces says it all: Thanks to the embargo which was in place, I had to control my urge to comment on the previous Taigun thread; I wasn’t quite sure if I would reveal too many details by posting something and cross the line! We were blown away with the 1.5 TSI + DSG GT variant and felt this was a proper upgrade for current owners of the 90-100 hp segment hatchbacks (Polo, Punto and the likes). The car just stuck to the road like a leech and easily took corners at high speeds with minimal body roll while dismissing small potholes and minor road undulations (the test car’s tire pressures were set at 32 psi before we started the drive). While I am warming up to crossovers, I would still prefer a hot hatch with a powerful engine (like this 1.5 TSI) over a crossover any day. And I feel so envious of CD right now because he is planning to switch from his Punto 90 hp and he’s at the crossroads - the Kushaq or the Taigun! And I can already smell what it is going to be! If I were him, I would bet on the top-end Taigun GT variant in the 1.5 TSI DSG guise because it comes with 6 airbags and the DSG, despite having a feeling of traveling in a ticking time-bomb. I would take the maximum warranty that I can right off the delivery (standard 4 years/1,00,000 km that comes with the car + extended 2 years/50,000 km) and swap the stock 17” gloss black alloys with these: That way, at least I am set for 6 years! I would also get the excessive chrome bits on the front and rear bumpers blackened. Gosh, this was an eye sore! Clearly VW has gone with the market sentiment - chrome, chrome and more chrome. If customers throng accessory shops to add more bling to their rides, might as well give them from the factory? Oh well! On the front and rear bumpers, on the door handles, on the front grill, on the headlamps, on the tail lights, on the GT badging on the fenders! There’s enough contrast on the front and rear bumpers with the fake diffusers finished in grey. Here’s what I mean: I know a few more who are planning to jump the gun from an aging Polo and have recommended the Taigun to them. I greatly value engine dynamics, road manners and high-speed stability over creature features and therefore, the Germans easily tip the scale over the Koreans. Pricing will definitely be the key here and I expect a small markup for the Taigun over the Kushaq. Make no mistake - the Taigun is to Kushaq just like the Vento is to the Rapid. They are exactly siblings with minor changes to the exteriors and interiors. Skoda somehow messed up the kitting of the Kushaq’s variants by skimping on the airbags on the top-end Kushaq 1.5 TSI DSG Style variant. All said and done, the Taigun does have some minor flaws and some niceties missing. As an existing Polo owner, I was surprised to find some of the existing features from the Polo/Vento missing such as the auto up-down windows for all the doors (in the Taigun, only the driver side door had it), anti-pinch feature for all the windows (we tested and found that the Taigun lacked this; prospective owners with kids, please be careful about this!), the gap between the A-pillar trim and the dashboard which caught my eye, the trim on the co-driver side dashboard which had a noticeable gap between the dash (not usually seen on VWs), dampers on the interior grab handles (come on VW, this damper barely costs anything; even the Dzire taxi had it!), the missing underbody protection for the powertrain (hopefully, this is sold as an accessory; we need this for Indian roads!), physical knobs for the climatronic unit (I would prefer knobs for the temperature and blower speed adjustment so I don’t have to take my eyes off the road to adjust them), missing height-adjustable seat belts, empty plastic trim on the roof liner next to the cabin light (could have omitted the trim altogether than give that part!) etc. Not deal breakers but an omission nonetheless. Then, there are some of them who are also likely to skip the Taigun top-end variant for its bigger brother built and shipped from the Europe - the T-Roc, for a slightly higher price tag. For approx. INR 4 lakhs more than the Taigun or the Kushaq, here’s what you’ll get on the T-Roc: 5-star Euro NCAP safety rating Added safety features like HSA (Hill Start Assist), TPMS, auto hold, lane assist, emergency braking etc. A more mature European design, almost Audi’esque Rear fog lamp Electronic parking brake Rear disc brakes Pretensioners for the front seat belts Virtual cockpit cluster with active info display Under-body protection for the powertrain Vienna leather seats (with heating which unfortunately no one would use in India) The better sounding Composition media infotainment system Dynamic headlamp range adjustment ORVMs with puddle lamps, heated mirrors and convex mirror for the driver side unit Front parking sensors with the park pilot button Panoramic sunroof with powered sunroof cover Dual-zone climate control Insulation/cladding on the bonnet Drawers under the front seats Lumbar adjustment for driver seat Ski hatch for the rear seat Illuminated sun visors for both sides Door open warning lights on all four door cards Flip-type reverse camera integrated into the monogram similar to the Passat with better image quality Frame-less, aerodynamic wipers for the front and rear wipers Height adjustable luggage compartment floor with a better quality floor Bundled 12V tire inflator Glovebox with light and damped opening for the lid Passenger airbag deactivation switch The feel-good factor of an imported car The best of all - no annoying beeps from the cluster for the 80/120 kmph speed limits! What will you miss out on the T-Roc compared to the top-end Taigun 1.5 TSI DSG? The newer VW steering with perforated leather on the sides The newer VW DSG gearshifter with the subtle white backlighting 10"" infotainment system with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay Brushed stainless steel pedal caps with rubber inserts Wireless Qi charging pad (not a dealbreaker as some would not want to use inductive charging for their devices) Cruise control Ambient lighting on the dash and door cards 61 mm longer wheelbase If I had the budget for the Taigun 1.5 TSI DSG, I would really put the T-Roc in contention! Good time for the DIYers and modifiers too - I can already see the potential DIY/retrofit options lined up for the Taigun - front parking sensors with the 8K optical parking system, changing the instrument cluster from the analog units on the lower variants to the digital unit and even the existing digital clusters to the virtual cockpit display from the T-Roc, installing the KESSY - keyless entry and drive system, gas struts to lift the bonnet (plenty of space on the sides where the bonnet rests), adding a windshield washer fluid level warning light (assuming the stock cluster has the provision for the warning light and an SMD LED soldered to the board), adding a damper and light to the glovebox lid (come on, even the humble Tiago gets a damped glovebox lid; gives it a premium feel!) the different VCDS/OBD11 mods that can be done (including disabling the 80/120 kmph speed alerts ) and so forth!

Just wanted to add that we are 90% sure of VW not offering a 1.5 TSI MT in the top variant, but it is one that can be corrected by the time of launch. So let's not discuss it too much until the launch day. This could be confirmed that day (and would be a grave error), or VW could simply correct its folly as the company has ample time to. If you ask me, there is no reason for them to not offer the 1.5 TSI MT top variant. It is the AT top variant that causes 'sticker shock', not the 1-lakh cheaper MT.

As with Kushaq, the usual riders will apply with Taigun too when it will come for consumers to decide with their purses. Taigun will win hearts of few and will make less sense to many vis-a-vis the Creta and Seltos duo. I still don't get the feature distribution decisions in Kushaq and Taigun from SVWIPL.

Taigun looks elegant, carries that European design from VAG, but also a lot of chrome! The proportions are brilliant, from some angles it reminds me of Audi Q3+Polo combo (not saying it's influenced, but I get reminded of this). The front has that butch that is needed for a SUV, but the rear is more modern and I feel the lights are generally well designed by VW, but this doesn't give that feel (subjective). The interior looks clean and futuristic, I liked the ambient lighting effect with the cluster and infotainment a lot. The infotainment looks too glossy, wonder if they have anti-glare glass/layer on it. The MID digital cluster looks well designed, but I feel the resolution is on slightly lower side for the graphics that is hosts. Brilliant packaging to get more space and few quirks implemented to perfection like the first aid kit strapped on the rear wheel arches is a space saver (but accessing from inside in the event of crash and passengers getting pinned down is tricky. A lot of cost cutting has been done like the insulation, underbody area and also one mold tailgate cover. Few points what I didn't like much, 1. The front grille with those elements are copied & rotated 180 degrees from Renault Duster I guess. 2. Wat the hell is that keyfob? doesn't look like VW's at all.", 9th August 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,535,"3,831"
10, TorqueIndia , 10:39 ,BHPian,"Thanks to Crazydriver and Gannu_1 for such a detailed review. Between TAIGUN & KUSHAQ, the former looks instantly attractive for me, also TAIGUN got a good presence from the front than KUSHAQ. Had a grudge against VW group for lugging polo family for those 12 years without generation update even after the global unveil of the new generation, now I'm fine with their offering which is going to serve all those POLO & PUNTO customers who are not yet upgraded. I'm seeing these compact SUVs CRETA, SELTOS, DUSTER, KICKS, KUSHAQ & TAIGUN as sub 15lakh cars. It would have been nice and affordable if VW provide AT option right from 1.0L base variants.

As GTO said it is too early to comment on this but for potential buyers who are at crossroads between Kushaq vs Taigun, decision-making will be straightforward. If you want fully loaded automatic go for Taigun, if MT then Kushaq. Ultimately it is a win-win for the VW group.

23, ron178 , 12:17 ,Senior - BHPian,"I'm still a bit confused with the new VAG products - but I must say I like the Taigun more than I liked the Kushaq at launch. It just looks more like a VAG than the Škoda does. The Kushaq's interiors seem to have been modified just to differentiate it from the Taigun but it doesn't have the typical Škoda interiors (vast expanse of beige and airy dash), even in ambience, though they look good nevertheless. The Taigun looks more like a proper, modern-day VW. Sure, the interior quality isn't as nice as the Polo and Vento but people have been complaining about that internationally for some time now, even with the T-Roc. Not to mention, the interior styling is in line with the new international T-Cross/Polo/Virtus etc which is a refreshing change. I think the analogue dials on this one look gorgeous. The digital cluster isn't bad either but just makes the cabin look too full of screen. I have begun to actually like the body coloured panels. I do like the grille of the Comfortline variant (if that is what it is - the wild cherry red one) better than the GT's. It reminds me of the pre-facelift Tiguan diesel. I don't like the new wheels much. In fact, there was a car at the media drive shipped with the Polo's alloys for transport and I actually liked those better than these wheels. I don't like the chrome air dam and rear bumper one bit. Quote: Originally Posted by CrAzY dRiVeR Since the Taigun doesn't need to stick to the sub-4m rules, the bumpers protrude on either side. This should help protect the metal work in city driving conditions where minor altercations happen, and gets a thumbs up from us: Good thing is, in a minor bump, that chrome will fall right off. Rare case where I'd let the tailgater keep it and probably pay him too. Quote: Originally Posted by CrAzY dRiVeR •Keyless entry, chrome window-line, chrome-lined door handles.

At least that's how it works in our MQB Octavia (3rd-gen). Do note that it's a pain to put back once removed because it demands perfect alignment of the plastic tabs.

Also, 6 airbags on the automatic - my main problem with the Kushaq - has been fixed, although I really wish the one-litre automatic was available with them too. I won't make assumptions about crashworthiness before an NCAP test because it will just lead to nowhere and might instead start heated arguments. That said I am extremely curious about the crashworthiness of these new VAG products. I'm sure the Global NCAP is too, and with 4 new products launching in a year I'm sure they will test at least one of them soon.

I am personally interested to see how the 1.0 TSI+AT top-spec is going to be placed. I guess its going to offer the best of both worlds ; i.e. loaded interiors [with Kiger-like virtual cockpit (wish it got the fully blown one), 6 airbags, ventilated seats], exteriors (those smashing machine cut alloys) and moderately punchy 113 BHP engine and reliable AQ200 torque convertor. Even if no virtual cockpit, that dot matrix analogue cluster looks nice compared to the Kushaq's. Some surprises Why have a dummy button on the steering if there is no feature programmed to it? Is it something that could be only for the export markets? Undamped door handles and glove box Fabric seats on the range topping trims and nice leatherette ones w/ventilation on the probable VFM trims No rough road package for India. Could find an exposed oil/fuel filter that could shatter on stone impact. No keyless go in 2021 for an almost 15-20 lakh car No dual-tone trumpet horn which was a typical VAG item.

35, ZB86 , 15:08 ,BHPian,"Fantastic review Gannu_1 and CD. Despite all the video reviews on Youtube by various channels, nothing comes close to this. Taigun's cabin looks much better than Kushaq. The AC vents in Kushaq looked very budget like, and the shape of the vents seemed to amplify the feeling for me. The layout in Taigun even if it is of the same quality looks better in pictures. From outside, both Taigun and Kushaq look their part and it is a tough call to pick between the two. But when it comes to interiors, visually the Taigun definitely feels a notch above. The rear space makes it difficult for me to consider this as my next upgrade, since I have a family of 5, and it became a little difficult with my Ecosport which I sold few months back. Every carmaker should give the option of Manual / AT on their top end variant. Unless the sales are such that people are not buying the manual anymore in this price bracket. If I am not wrong, I think it is only the Seltos which does that in segment. Little off the topic, but I have never owned a Diesel car, the current crop of Crossovers / SUV tempt me to consider one for my next car. A question to the members, if your average daily drive is below 10kms, and you do not cross 4-5k kms in a year, would it still make sense to consider the current gen diesels in Creta / Harrier?", 9th August 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,31,141

After reading the TeamBHP experience & having gone through the usual Vlogs (Evo, Autocar, OD, Faisal, etc.), it's a heart v/s brain decision here. By Heart, I'm all in for Taigun. The grunt that 1.5 TSI makes; puts a smile on my face. The way it handles around the corners makes me just grab that steering right away. And the way it seems planted on the road at high speeds, I crave for those long highway rides. By Brain, I'm being put off by some logical questions. - Can you live without Ventilated seats? May be. But It doesn't even have leather seats. Oh no! - Can you live without a 360 camera? I'll manage. But it's reverse parking camera doesn't even have dynamic guidelines. Oh Crap! - Can you live without Front parking sensors? Why not. But even the rear has only 3 sensors (not 4). Really?? And it doesn't even have a proper TPMS. Shit! - Can you live with a smaller boot? For sure! I can fold the rear seat when needed. But the rear doesn't fold fully flat and the loading lip is very deep. Oh my back! - Can you live without a premium audio system from the market leaders (Bose, Alpine)? Definitely! But it doesn't even have a woofer. What?? - Can you leave without one touch roll up/down and anti-Pinch windows? May be. But your decade old Vento model has both of them. I know, feels let down. - Can you live without NCAP test results? Yes, Because the doors make a proper thud. Remember, Seltos also made the Thud & everyone praised its build. Scratching my head now! - Can you afford high cost of service & maintenance? Sure! But Volkswagen ASS is..... That's a worry. - Can you afford ~21L for it? Yes, it's a German engineered car. But you get much more value for money in Polo/Vento (and other CSUVs)? That's true. I see, people going Gaga over Taigun & it's driving pleasure. But how many of us, bought Polo GTI with 1.8 TSI engine for its sheer driving pleasure. Many people are betting on the Facelift or even launch to rectify some misses. But seriously, how many facelifts or value additions or rectifications, we saw in Polo/Vento/Rapid in the last 10 years. With Creta/Seltos selling like hot cakes and MG coming up with Astor with stupendous Value for Money, I fear Taigun/Kushaq may go the old way of offering heavy discounts within a year of the launch. The Vento owner, the driving enthusiast in me, wants them to succeed, but the possibility looks bleak. I still wish them luck and my wait goes on!

Nothing more. That said - Your feelings echo mine. Both Taigun and Kushaq won't become best-sellers or even challenge the Creta or Seltos.

Quote: Originally Posted by ashishk29 Sorry, but I have a bit of a hard time believing that all 4 discs wouldn't have been better than a 2 disc-2 drum setup. You're right, technically. I'm only saying it doesn't matter in the experience of the Taigun vs the competition - the braking with rear drums feels better to use than the competition which has rear discs. And yes, you're right again - insulation under the hood could also have been provided. Both are cost cutting decisions, no doubt. But again I'm only saying an average joe isn't going to revv a turbo-petrol motor to 5000rpm to notice, which is around when the motor starts to get a bit boomy inside the cabin. The experience is refined at lower useable rpms, even on the 1.0 (as I felt on the Kushaq). Both of these are negatives on paper, not deal breakers in real. Hope that is clearer.

I am sure that the VW Taigun is great to drive and exudes the VW quality as per all the online reviews but having said that, once you compare it to its Korean cousins, well, you really can't. Though I do admit that I am a bit biased since I own the Kia Seltos 1.4DCT, and I can safely say that, SO FAR, there is no other car out there (other than Creta) which can match the overall VFM package. I mean the kind of stuff in here like the HUD, blind spot cameras (right and left), rear view camera with 360 degree (great resolution by the way), dynamic guidelines, ventilated seats, peppy DCT box, sunroof, electric adjustable driver seats, you name it, its all there. Barring the panoramic sunroof (which I don't think is a necessity) and maybe the e-brake (which again, not THAT important) and paddle shifters, its pretty much loaded to the gills.

I think the feel, fit and finish differentiated VAG from the rest of the car brands, in India. (A VAG car was always an aspiration for us budget riders) And this is where VAG has decided to skimp. Its a nobody's guess that the panoramic sunroof is a deal sealer. VAG decides not to have it. And so on with EPB, all discs and all that smart car tech. Even the upholstery looks low rent. A family car cannot be driver focused and be expected to sell in high numbers. I fear Taigun and Kushaq will again become niche products very soon and what follows is disillusionment in dealer and the subsequent after effects.

(1) People who prioritize safety and driving dynamics over ""features"" - 20% of the market but growing. This group is ok to skip out on bling features - 360 camera, secondary displays (do you really need another display to tell you the speed?) and the likes. They also desire a more premium in-car experience - good quality sound system (vs brand sticker job), fast and responsive infotainment unit, backlit buttons, etc. But, what this group doesn't like to skip on is the safety of their families and the drive of the car. (2) People who desire all sorts of creature comforts, aren't as concerned about safety and don't really care about the drive too much. The car is a prized possession to flaunt to relatives and friends. This group mostly doesn't understand one safety feature from the other (three letter acronym overload). This is 80% of the market. For the 80%, Hyundai and its subsidiaries will always win. This is the OnePlus and Xiaomi strategy of the auto world. For the 20%, VAG / Tata / some Mahindra cars / some Japs / some other European brands will be the only real options. Samsung strategy of the auto world (relevant products at all price points).

A CBU from the European side will break easily on our roads with big bills to pay for otherwise. Made in and for India is certainly preferred. The VAG twins are a very nice effort at producing something meaningful for our market for the first time and competitive environment is good for the customer who will otherwise have only the Korean brands to look upto. However as we have seen with Nissan magnite, the vehicle in isolation is good but once customers compare it to an established standard, it will fall short in some areas - same here with VAG twins.", 10th August 2021,volkswagen-taigun,COK\BLR\MYS,"3,579","10,063"

This group is ok to skip out on bling features - 360 camera, secondary displays (do you really need another display to tell you the speed?) and the likes.

(2) People who desire all sorts of creature comforts, aren't as concerned about safety and don't really care about the drive too much. The car is a prized possession to flaunt to relatives and friends. This group mostly doesn't understand one safety feature from the other (three letter acronym overload). This is 80% of the market. For the 80%, Hyundai and its subsidiaries will always win. This is the OnePlus and Xiaomi strategy of the auto world. For the 20%, VAG / Tata / some Mahindra cars / some Japs / some other European brands will be the only real options. Samsung strategy of the auto world (relevant products at all price points).

Service being one reason why I skipped the Octavia while shopping for a D Segment sedan. The reason you buy a top end car is for the features, calling bling is just sour grapes, there's not a single car maker that doesn't charge for features, in fact luxury means a good number of features, not 4 chairs and an engine. The 20% usually static in any market, the ones who burn their fingers swallowing marketing drivel usually bail at the first opportunity. A 360 degree camera helps you park in a tight spot, how is that bling? The heroes who are building electric charging infrastructure as compensation for emissions fraud will have no trouble cutting costs to build barely roadworthy vehicles. The DSG is a train wreck, it'll give trouble, only a question of when. VW doesn't have the confidence to offer a real top end version, removing ventilated seats and giving fabric upholstery isn't some kind of engineering prowess, it's plain penny pinching. Their cars got safety features as they got long in the tooth and there was no way to get costumers to spend money on their ancient models.

I had a Vento from 2010 till 2017 and that was top notch build and trouble free. Sadly, the same cannot be said of the later Polos and Ventos. For that matter, even the T Roc appears compromised and if you look closely and do a comparison between it and the Taigun/Kushaq, there isn't much difference in terms of build. I now own an Ecosport and have the upgrade itch. Though logically, the Taigun/Kushaq would qualify as an upgrade, at least in terms of space, the Kushaq that I drove didn't seem to hold a candle to the ES in terms of build.

To Say ""aren't concerned about safety and don't really care about driving"", is absolutely disrespectful towards a group based on their car ownership. No one is born an automobile scholar, but today's world provides enough resources to get educated. And the TeamBHP community is one of them and should provide unbiased opinions based on the facts. Coming to the features - How on earth 360 camera is a bling feature, how are front parking sensors not usable, how is TPMS not important and how come a sub-woofer will not provide better audio experience. Coming to the safety - Please name only those safety features that Taigun has and so called sub-par cars do not have. All of them have EBD, ABS, Hill assist, airbags, ISOFIX, etc. For a matter of fact, others have Hill Descent control, Electronic parking Brake and full TPMS; over Taigun. About NCAP rating, Taigun is not even tested yet. This is the India specific platform with heavily localized materials. Seltos global also scored 5 stars, but Indian Seltos got barely 3. So, hold your horses until we hear about NCAP rating for Taigun. The point, we all will agree upon (based on Facts) is driving dynamics. Here, definitely Taigun is great with TSI-DSG combination and better handling/ steering response. If Volkswagen (Or Skoda) wanted to prove that their cars are safe & premium - why couldn't they send cars for NCAP testing before launch, provide all the premium features and then command a price premium (like an iPhone does). They are simply caught in between, trying to balance safety/features/material quality/price. Again, this is just my opinion. There are many people who decide on their only car in lifetime with their hard earned money, based on TeamBHP forum and we should stick to the facts without stereotyping (like the brilliant fact based reviews by the moderators on the Forum).", 10th August 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Mumbai,87,696

I had to keep a stock of rewritable CDs. My friends with i20 even had a mini fridge. But after I drove their i20 once, I decided to never drive it again. Hyundai Creta ( 1st Gen, Family Car ) : I was frankly not in favor after my experience with i20. However, Creta drove better than i20, come with good features and my family loved it. But, I would still prefer driving my Polo rather than Creta. I never got that smile driving a Creta. Honda City : Upgrading from Polo, I choose Honda City over Vento or Rapid due to VW ASS and better features. And frankly I really like Honda City. But, I still miss my Polo a lot . It is a lot better than Creta but still I miss that driving dynamics of Polo. And that's why I'm looking forward to Taigun / Kushaq. Hoping to get that smile back.

So a fully loaded Kushaq manual may be better equipped than its VW counterpart. Conversely the top of line Taigun automatic may be better equipped and slightly differently priced than the Kushaq A/T.

I have seen the Kushaq in person and though it looked ok, it dint appeal to me as much since it does not have the presence in my opinion. And both the cars, I feel, are in the ""neither here nor there"" category. I will elaborate what I meant by that regarding Kushaq and Taigun through the below points. 1. Is it an entry level sub compact ? Answer is No, but is it comparable with other next level compact SUV in the category, again answer is no 2. Is it priced for the size and value offered by competition? Answer is No. But is it way over priced for the quality?, again answer is No 3. Is it premium offering ? Answer is Yes. But does it miss out on some features offered by entry level cars of SAVW, Answer is yes So this is what I meant by ""neither here nor there"" kind of a car. I would rather consider Karoq or T Roc as the comparable compact SUV which can be considered as competition to Korean siblings.

Anyone ever thought, a Wagon R which costs almost the same as a Tiago sells two and a half times as a Tiago? Take a drive in both cars and you will realize soon enough. The claustrophobic rear seat, poor knee room, head room, poor ingress, egress, low hip point on the rear seat and a smaller boot, all these things make a man with a family look at the Wagon R instead of Tiago which is a safer and enthusiast car.

Besides, a lot of other cars in the same price bracket do come equipped with all 4 discs (Creta, Seltos, XUV300, XUV500 to name a few). They should've provided rear discs at least to the 1.5 variants............. It's all about the general expectation at a general price point. It's great that VW is till guaranteeing their classic handling and dynamics experience, but they need to at least match their competitors in these rather basic things. Since we are open to considering the performance w.r.t competitors, it may be possible that a 2-disc + 2-drum setup can match or outperform a supposedly superior 4-disc setup of a competitor even if the vehicles aren't as incredibly heavy as they should be for a drum setup to be of any advantage. Now, I'm not saying that this will always be the case, but exceptions do exist. Let's see one example of this in action (brought to my notice by BHPian TurboGuy): Verna (4-disc) vs Rapid (2-disc + 2-drum) (Skoda Kushaq | A Close Look & Preview) Here, you see an example of a supposedly inferior setup outperforming a supposedly superior setup. Now, this is not to say that the same will be the case for Taigun and its competitors; I have no way of knowing that. The only logical way to find that out, is by performing brake tests on similar surfaces. I would also like to point out that this video does not imply that a 4-disc Rapid can not outperform a 2-disc + 2-drum Rapid, it's just that we won't know how it will work out in a real life scenario without real world figures of the braking performance. Sometimes, the specs on paper may not translate to real-life, and in such a case, it may be better to not have 4-discs (especially if you're concerned about braking performance) which may look better on paper, but may not reliably translate to a better real world performance.", 10th August 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Mohali,216,768

With this current strategy of VW group i dont think its going to impact Koreans much as they will continue to sell similar numbers going forward too. Kushaq/Taigun doesnt seem like disrupting Creta/Seltos sales like how WagonR did to Santro two decades back and how Baleno did to i20 last decade. Koreans will thank European for skipping on features and tweaking their quality standard and still using the premium price they introduced in the segment and Europeans will thank Koreans for the premium price that they created for this mass market segment which will now benefit them too.

Inflation adjusted prices reflect that reality. People have to push this build quality thing so hard that, suddenly it becomes awesome when the top end model doesn't have all the features. The market is used to seeing top end cars with all the features, customers who can afford the 1.5 aren't the sort who will be willing to compromise on kit.

How many people in this forum knows BSNL's script injections, Airtel's Wacky privacy policy, phone manufacturer's data policy etc (yes, including Samsung)? Aren't we expecting 4 rear cameras in phone as norm now, when we are paying 20k for the phone? Collectively, we should force manufacturers to do a better job and build better cars.

My comparison wasn't about the braking performance against the competitors. I am fully aware that the braking performance between two vehicles with different braking setup is not a comparable metric.

If, as a potential customer, you think that all discs should have been part of the kit at least on the top variants, and you are willing to pay for the supposed increase in braking performance, then it's reasonable in my opinion. Even if you wish to have all discs at no additional cost in the top trims, that is perfectly fine too.

If you consider that 4-discs is supposed to be representative of the parameter 'braking performance', VW/Skoda could potentially match or exceed their immediate competition with what the general public perceives to be an inferior setup. The example I gave was supposed to establish a precedent for this scenario. Of course, as a casual buyer, I also used to assume that 4-discs = better braking, before I ran into the example shared above. In the scenario presented above, it is not Skoda that needs to match its competitors, because the competition can't square up even with a supposedly better setup. The tables have turned; it is now Hyundai that needs to up its game and at least match their competitor. So, while we could be criticising Skoda/VW for offering a supposedly inferior setup at the same price and not being their own competition, we should also be equally critical of the Korean siblings should they be outdone/matched by VW/Skoda's supposedly inferior setup.

Why? I see a couple of broad segments VW will go after with the Taigun: The aspirational SUV buyer who is new to the segment, upgrading from a hatchback or a compact sedan, who is proud to graduate into this segment, wants a nice car, with all basic features in place, wants a safe car, good service, and is quite interested the brand value. This person is going to be highly price sensitive, will probably go for lower variants in the 1.0 TSI range. The Compact SUV owner wanting to upgrade into the mid-size SUV segment. Wants good features and probably is also upgrading to go from an MT to an AT. This buyer wants features, safety, drive experience, good service and is willing to pay a reasonable premium, although still be somewhat budget-limited. Not an enthusiast type of person and is unlikely to prioritize engine performance or drive experience above all else. This buyer is most likely go for the higher trims of the 1.0 TSI. The existing mid-size sedan or SUV owner who is changing cars after several years. This segment is not new to the game and are willing to pay top bucks and want all the bells and whistles. They also care about the driving experience. They will gravitate towards the top end offering (GT DSG), and may have trouble deciding between the Taigun/Kushaq versus the Creta/Seltos. Those who want every bell and every whistle will go to the latter and those who want the best driving as well as safest machine out there will pick the former. Now comes the last segment - The one USP of the Taigun that all reviewers unequivocally agree is that it is the best driver's car in the segment, well ahead of the Creta and Seltos. It is also snazzy and stylish. VW is definitely targeting the segment of up and coming corporate executives in their late 20s/early 30s who crave global products and love driving and are particular about style and design elegance. This is evident from the advertisements and personas therein that VW have been putting out for the Taigun. Now, the GT DSG is going to end up too expensive for this segment of young first/second car owners, who prioritize driving experience over bells and whistles and are already stretching their rupees to get into the 15 lakh+ segment. VW has a good opportunity to drive volumes with this segment in addition to the mainstream segments is aiming for good volumes across variants, it needs to include this segment for sure. This is where the GT manual comes in and can pull in decent volumes from this segment if priced aggressively. ", 11th August 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Chennai,"2,220","9,796"

Generally, there should be no problem changing bookings or even cancelling it altogether (at times it might only be a dealership specific issue), the only challenge comes is you may be put to back of the line in terms of vehicle allocation increasing your waiting period in case its a high demand variant/color combination. From what I have understood, VW and Skoda are playing a smart game of slotting each others variants allowing customers to choose between their variants basis their feature priorities. Hence, I expect, VW would offer top of the line 1.0 AT variant with 6 airbags, but we should only know about this when VW releases variant wise specifications. If you are happy with 1.0 AT and only worried about 6 airbags availability, I would suggest you rather book the 1.0 AT variant and in case it misses out on 6 airbags, you ask dealer to change it to 1.5 AT variant.

127, shibujp , 18:07 ,Senior - BHPian,"Great review guys!! As usual. Interesting to note that while Skoda played up the 1.0L variant, Volkswagen is pushing on the 1.5L variant in it's GT guise. I for one think that the stripped out GT Manual version is a interesting approach especially for someone who is looking for performance more than anything. I would also have loved to see a full fat digital speedo cluster rather than the half baked version provided. They should remember that the Creta and Alcazar provided much better versions. As it stands the clean, neat analog dials of the GT Manual does it better for me. Another aspect is the chrome. Instead of this perhaps Volkswagen should have tried with a brushed chrome or matt silver finish. I am sure their CMF teams could have come up with a much better option given their global expertise. But perhaps sourcing a local supplier might have been the challenge. That said masking the chrome on the front bumper leaves an expanse of boring black that needs something to break the monotony. What I am waiting for is a 1.5 manual TSI option in their upcoming C segment sedan. That should be something. Drive on, Shibu.", 11th August 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Trivandrum,"1,743","3,137"

On the doubts expressed on VW service and the DQ transmission, I would like to share my own experience. In five years and 88,000 km of running the Vento TSI, we have serviced it five times. Cost per service is high but balances out with lower cost of brands whose service interval is 10k km, if you calculate per km. By whatever margin it is more, I have no complaints. If I need to pay slightly more for the experience of driving a better designed and built car, so be it. Service experience has been good overall. No experience of shoddy work. At one time the service engineer tried to bill an item twice, which I immediately complained. The DQ transmission has been trouble free this far.

Getting used to controls in a rental might take time, but if your own car had the same controls you will feel right at home. I think removing all those things including one touch for all windows and as someone suggested to even swap the indicator controls will make the cars very non VW like. What will be even more weird is the same car having different controls in India and different controls if you rent one outside. I think many old VW-Skoda users feel right at home in all VW group cars, including even the Audis because of the similar controls for cruise control and indicators.

152, CarBorne , 23:39 ,BHPian,"Great review as always. If I may suggest, we should also start adding the performance of headlights, as this topic has come up quite frequently with the new reflector-type headlights gaining more prominence. Reading the review followed by the opinions of other forum members is a joy in itself. Coming to the car, I am a bit surprised with all the reviewers extolling the driving dynamics of Taigun, which wasn't the case to the same degree when Kushaq was launched. Is the Taigun really that better than Kushaq in driving dynamics? Or is it down to the fact that Skoda provided both engines for reviews and the focus got split? I am actually a bit baffled by the lack of attention to detail and thought shown by VAG group - seems like they are launching a car for the first time in India. They need to understand the most of the car buyers in developing countries, including India, towards which Taigun and Kushaq are targetted are first-time car buyers - in most cases, it is the first car in the family. And therefore it is an occasion, occasion to feel good about your possession or buy. So even if the buyer is a driving enthusiast, the person can't ignore the things which will matter to other family members. However, it seems the feel-good factor in the case of both of these is limited to only driving. There are so many items that could have elevated a buyer's experience without any drastic impact on prices. A case in point being the KeyFob. You hold the keyfob of a Seltos for a test drive and you feel good about it, even feel like flaunting it. Compare that to the feeling of holding Taigun's keyfob. The quality of wipers they have used, they look outright ugly. What additional costs would it have resulted in? The non-functional switches on the dashboard even on the top variant. They are an eyesore, more so when you have paid top bucks to get the top variant. Reverse parking camera without dynamic guidelines. The system development costs have already been incurred, what are the additional costs of integrating it in a vehicle? The decision to remove the subwoofer from the top end. What would have been the additional cost of including it? The decision to remove one touch all window down - which was already present in their existing offerings. Few of our forum members will not agree, but I will also add a well-fitted roof lining to the list It would have been great if VAG had made the driving dynamics a differentiator, the same feel-good factors with driving dynamics as icing on the cake. Sadly, they have made it an either/or situation. For them to achieve their goal of acquiring 5% of the Indian market, they need to appeal to a much larger segment of people. In current form, probably they will end up being the polo of cross-overs - appealing to a specific set of users. Fortunately, they have the perception of being safer/well-built cars going for them which will get them the safety-conscious buyers as well. For me, the launch of Seltos is the benchmark of launches. Everything was perfect, I remember many reviewers complimenting the drive quality before Kushaq and Taigun. That is till the safety rating came out. I am myself in the market for my first car and have booked a Seltos because of the long waiting period. I will most likely go with either Kushaq or Taigun, but I won't be super thrilled with the decision.", 13th August 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Gurgaon,31,67

They need to understand the most of the car buyers in developing countries, including India, towards which Taigun and Kushaq are targetted are first-time car buyers - in most cases, it is the first car in the family. And therefore it is an occasion, occasion to feel good about your possession or buy. So even if the buyer is a driving enthusiast, the person can't ignore the things which will matter to other family members. However, it seems the feel-good factor in the case of both of these is limited to only driving. There are so many items that could have elevated a buyer's experience without any drastic impact on prices. A case in point being the KeyFob. You hold the keyfob of a Seltos for a test drive and you feel good about it, even feel like flaunting it. Compare that to the feeling of holding Taigun's keyfob. The quality of wipers they have used, they look outright ugly. What additional costs would it have resulted in? The non-functional switches on the dashboard even on the top variant. They are an eyesore, more so when you have paid top bucks to get the top variant. Reverse parking camera without dynamic guidelines. The system development costs have already been incurred, what are the additional costs of integrating it in a vehicle? The decision to remove the subwoofer from the top end. What would have been the additional cost of including it? The decision to remove one touch all window down - which was already present in their existing offerings. Few of our forum members will not agree, but I will also add a well-fitted roof lining to the list I am myself in the market for my first car and have booked a Seltos because of the long waiting period. I will most likely go with either Kushaq or Taigun, but I won't be super thrilled with the decision. I agree to most. In fact what really got my goat was the Digital Instrument Cluster on the top model. After the initial excitement and thrill to know they'd offer it on the Taigun - it was a rude rude shock to know it was not a full sized one and just a smaller 8"" unit? (volkswagen marketing shrewdly used cm's to express the size as 20.32cm - an attempt to imprint a ""large"" size in a potential buyers mind). I literally find that the most off putting reason to pay the maximum money for a top of the line trim which will remind me of the corners cut - everytime i look at the speedo?? The 2 dummy displays or whatever they are on either side are downright tacky! Is that really something a carmaker would do with a top of the range trim? What were they thinking? Was it really such a costly element to add a full size display that they had to adopt this approach? A buyer who buys the top range is anyway more likely to pay the ""Extra"" for the good to have bits - so why do this? Having said that, I still think that if the expected safety ratings and overall build quality of the VAG cars are to be found in the Tagiun (and the Kushaq) then yes, despite their oddball choices in doing these things, they'd still be a compelling buy over the korean twins.", 14th August 2021,volkswagen-taigun,VABB,366,319

The problem with VW is, they want to portray themselves as a premium brand (nothing bad in general) and another problem is the marketing people in those companies are disconnected from Indian customer expectations. They have done lots of localisations for the Kushaq and Taigun but priced like usual import stuff with less features. The nail in the coffin is the small overall size and small engine.

IMO the Korean twins are equal or marginally behind in the performance and handling parameters, while build quality is superior in VAG twins. However, they still need to prove this with a 5* Ncap rating, because their target buyer is likely to consider this. With XUV, the buyers will have an option of even better engine (++50PS and ++130NM), and hopefully a 5* NCAP rating too. If Mahindra sorts out the ride and handling balance, XUV can be a compelling reason for many prospective VW twins buyers to consider the XUV700. IMO more than the Hector/Harrier, the VW twins will face the harshest brunt of the XUV700. They simply excel in very few areas (Performance and ride/handling), and are handicapped in most others (road presence, space, boot, features, interior quality, ASS image, Petrol only motors, DSG issues and high price) I totally agree with you. In my case, I was looking for an upgrade to my Jazz Petrol Manual (5 yrs old), which has zero issues till date, but it is not ""fun-to-drive"" car and hence I thought of upgrade, but I am not in a hurry. I was eagerly waiting for Kushaq, but its a disappointment from interiors as well a size perspective (not a proper 5 seater) for that premium pricing. Even Taigun will have the same characters except that it has better interiors (I think, based on reviews) and comes with 6 airbags for 1.5+DSG. In fact I spoke to VW SA, planned to attend their roadshow in Bangalore and was about to pre-book Taigun. Now, with XUV700 in picture, why not consider this if it ticks most of the boxes (ride handling, AT, safety, space, interiors).

Firstly the launch of Kushaq with missing 6 airbags on the AT variant (No logic on that) and now with Taigun, they skip the ventilated seats from the 1.5.

Taigun, which they called as the car of 2021 will start deliveries at the end of September when most of the year is gone.

Thought I'll post the reply here as well - XUV 7OO is too large for me (though how I wish it were not!) - but I do believe both these vehicles will redefine expectations from that segment - of a well built product that can still match the Koreans on quality, spec and features.

For those who have not announced prices yet for competing/ overlapping products such as VW, questions will linger on whether they need to drop the planned prices to grab some eyeballs and interest, all of which is now focused on the XUV with its shock pricing and advanced features. I really do believe VW will need an entry variant at 9.99 lakhs given how aggressive XUV pricing is. For someone looking at the base variant of the Taigun, they can have a much more powerful and spacious car with equal if not more features for only a slight price premium!

From Autocar review:The rear seats of the Kushaq are well contoured. This aggressive bolstering allows passengers to remain seated firmly when theres movement inside the cabin. However, there is a flip side. Because these have been contoured for two passengers, it becomes hard to fit a third. And when you do that, the passengers who are pushed to the sides start feeling uncomfortable. Other than this one drawback, the Kushaqs rear seat experience is a pleasant one. Theres ample space even for six-footers, and the cabin feels nice and airy. Hence, the Kushaq works well as a 4-seater, but won't be as comfortable as a 5-seater.

DISCLAIMER: My observations and comments have a predominant influence from my ownership of the S-Cross and occasional drives on the EcoSport. Pro-tips for the event: Choose the earliest slot of the day - you'll have the opportunity of a tête-à-tête with VW folks. No hints about the variants and associated features. The preview is for you to check out the car inside out. Design Language: I have always been impressed with how elegant, classy, Volkswagenish the T-Cross looks. The Taigun being a derivative of the sibling is no different, but I'd really have liked to see a little less chrome on the GT line and a shade of black as an option. My choice and vote are definitely in favour of the Taigun when compared to the Kushaq. Road Presence: Looking at the Taigun in real gave me exactly the same impression I got from the S-Cross over half a decade ago. The German CSUV is definitely not in line to compete with the Korean twins for road presence and easily falls into the crossover category, which to me is perfectly alright and preferable. The driver's seat had to be raised all the way up almost to the highest position to be able to get a view I do on my S-Cross. This is not a typical tall seating CSUV like the EcoSport. Build: I have to say certainly not in the league of the Rapid or the Vento, but in between the S-Cross and the EcoSport. The doors don't appear to be thick and the tank-like build you see on a Vento is missing. I'll confidently say the EcoSport has considerably heavier doors and a significantly heavier tailgate. However, I always believe the best way to assess safety is from NCAP tests. Interiors: Much has already been spoken about the flat-bottom steering and the lighting. I liked that they've now integrated cruise function into the steering rather than as a stack. As for the plastics, door trims, dash area, handles are concerned, corner-cutting is evident. The elbow rest area cushioning, for instance, is a joke. Plastics seem to be of decent quality and hard, but my 6-year-old S-Cross has better feeling materials on the dash. Coming to the event itself, I think VW is doing this primarily to keep the interest sustained in the wake of a delayed launch. In fact, I was surprised to hear that VW considers the 5000 odd pre-bookings they've got to be a phenomenal success. One of the other executives I was talking to mentioned that they are keen on ensuring deliveries happen before the festive season kicks in. Quote: Originally Posted by rkaria1970 quiz him about the prices of 1.0 TSI wrt to xuv700 and will they price it aggressively than the Kushaq Well! While the small group that had huddled were giving each other a chance to ask Ashish a question or two, there was this really annoying, dominating guy who went berserk with his verbiage as to how VW should approach the market, provide features that the others (read Koreans) do, bring the same quality that they offer on other cars etc. He then went on and on about a panoramic roof, and in the end, also managed to take Ashish's number and said he would meet him when the test drives open. Unfortunately, some people just don't understand social etiquette and behaviour. Anyway, when finally asked about the pricing, Ashish said we shouldn't expect anything very different from how the Skoda is priced. I gather, they will think through this diligently. While I did click a few pictures, I think there are already many in the as-always, detailed trademark T-BHP review.

From the front, it looks like a mini Tiguan. 2. Rear looks stunning with Infinity LED Tail Lamps. 3. Comparing with Kushaq interiors - it looks brighter and better. 4. Infotainment and Digital cockpit were looking cool. 5. Backseat width is good for 2 adults and a kid (myself, wife, and 6 years kid could sit comfortably). 6.

255, SBM3J , 10:58 ,BHPian,"Went to the event in Bangalore on Saturday. I was more interested in seeing the grey shade. More interested in it because I was under the impression that grey, red and silver will come with body colored interior paint on dash. The 360 degree view in website interestingly shows all 3 have red in dashboard. Grey is my preferred color if I am going for Taigun, but if it comes with red interior, I will have to drop the idea. No one at the event had any idea on this too. The red one on display had non body matched interiors, so I guess the body colored interior is exclusive to GT variant. They should at least had one variant on display which has body colored interior at the event as this is something unique they have vs Kushaq.

Overall, the build quality of the car is very good compared to the other cars in the segment but the doors for example don't have the same heft as compared to the Polo or Vento. They don't shut with the same thud you're probably used to if you drive a Polo/Vento. The plastic quality feels cheap in certain places. Also, not a big fan of touch controls for AC versus having physical buttons . The ICE is a finger-print magnet. The White car on display was my favorite out of the three shades that were out there though there's a plenty of undesirable chrome everywhere. Also the Red car which seemed like a mid-spec MT variant (was locked) did not have the body color interiors and had different fabric on the seats. So, the red interiors may be specific to the GT variant in Red color though none of the folks from VW dealerships present there could clarify.

This ""large"" market looking for driving pleasure seems to be minuscule in reality as the numbers don't dictate any presence of this market. I don't think even in VAG groups calculation the market for what they are trying to sell is ""large"", neither is it miniscule enough to be confined to 1%. It mostly lies somewhere in between. This is amply borne out by the fact that Skoda itself aims to sell only 10 % (2,500) odd vehicles every month for what Hyundai group sells (22,000-25,000). Would they be able to sell 2,500 units a month for each of their two cars in the long term? I think Yes. There does seem to be a huge interest in both Taigun and Kushaq (especially the latter) not only on this forum but I see a neighbourhood Skoda showroom invariably full everytime I cross it. It's also amply clear that VAG cousins offer significantly better driving experience and safety while Hyundai cousins offer better features, size and road presence. Neither are lacking completely on what they are weak at, it's just that competition is better. At the end of the day there are multiple value propositions and one picks what's one thinks is the best. Numbers in which a car one wants to buy notches up every month may matter for some (maybe the most), may not for others.

273, ZB86 , 18:02 ,BHPian,"The kind of reception XUV 700 gets will define a lot on how the market is going to accept the VAG twins, and also force Tata and Korean twins to react. I understand the audience buying these cars is likely to be different, but there is the price factor which is going to play it's part. I feel the Kushaq / Taigun combined in the most optimistic scenario can do about 4,000 units a month, but might settle around 3,000. It will have to deal with Creta and Seltos at that price point. The sales for these two will have to come at the expense of Creta / Seltos. The Korean twins may not be the best car out there, but the overall package is hard to ignore and it does get a lot of things right. Whatever we have to say about their safety aspect, both are really loaded and one can recommend to anyone for city drive. Owning a Hyundai car generally is fuss free and the pre/post sales experience by and large is good. All these factors play such a big role for most of the average buyer out there. Add to this, the XUV 700 looks certain to shake the market if it can manage a trouble free run for a year. If we think Creta / Seltos is overpriced then it applies even more so to Kushaq / Taigun. Even in comparison to other cars from the VW Group like the Rapid, Vento, Polo, there seems to be a perceptible drop in the overall quality of the interiors of the two twins. When we look at the Karoq or T-Roc, one aspires to own them, it screams of quality inside out, but when I look at the Taigun, Kushaq, do I feel the same? Probably not. It does not take away anything from the safety aspect, dynamics and the refinement, that was never in question. It is definitely good for the competition if the new VW twins succeed, and one hopes they really gain the confidence of the buyer with their after sales service.", 24th August 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,31,141

280, androdev , 19:59 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"VW enjoys a certain premium brand perception similar to Toyota. Simply because VW and Toyota have always been the pricier options compared to Maruti and Hyundai. Most VW and Toyota buyers are buying what the brand stands for (Euro build, Japanese reliability, etc.). A VW customer is very likely to upgrade to a BMW and Toyota buyer to a Lexus (sadly Lexus is not a player in India due to crazy prices). Hyundai doesn't yet enjoy such identity - it is just seen as a great value for money option, which of course is a trump card in Indian market. All that VW needs to do is to poach the Hyundai buyers - there will be plenty of them who will cross over to VW if they find an equivalent product with hassle free ownership. VW now has an equivalent product. They just have to prove that the ownership will be hassle free. If they manage to prove that, I am confident Hyundai group will lose customers to VW. That is the only way VW can improve their numbers - at the expense of Hyundai. Providing a hassle free ownership is a monumental challenge for VW, time will tell how this plays out.

The Icing of VAG cars is its DSG, which is just awesome & fun to drive, the DSG works so well during both upshift and downshift you just cant ignore it. You will never realize which gear you are in if you do not pay attention to the dash indicator. Also, the way the DSG responds to the way you are driving, relaxed, racy, or just cruising is amazing once you are used to the DSG you wont like any other gear box, period. While there are concerns on DSG, which I can confirm as both my VW cars had issues with DSG under 30K. The Passat cc had shudders when pushed in 4th gear near the redline, and my Tiguan shuddered in 3rd and 4th gear at the redline. While this is a concern, I found a way to drive around it. I lift the throttle just for a microsec and throttle again, which results in the DSG moving quickly to 5th Gear in my Tiguan and would also not loose speed. While its not ideal its not an issue that will stop me from loving the DSG. After the first instance of shudder on my Tiguan I have driven another 20k without any inconvenience. What I learnt from other DSG users is that its better to move the gear to park mode in all signals or natural and use the electronic breaks, which can be activated by long press of the break leaver.

Its even more ironic that they launched a marketing campaign calling it the 'year of the Taigun' and yet wait for a good part of the year to even showcase the car. Indian customers are extremely value conscious and very few actually appreciate the driving dynamics of a car compared to features and size. VW should at least now move fast and capitalize on the higher waiting period for its competitors.

Skoda Kushaq breakdowns and concerns over a freshly baked VAG product! There are atleast half a dozen Kushaq owners having reported breakdowns (see Kushaq review thread or visit Skoda Kushaq club page on FB), EPC warning and power loss issues within just 2000 kms of delivery. Preparing for the gearbox to breakdown a few times in 10 years is one thing, expecting niggles on a brand new car is another - but going in with a mindset to expect the new vehicle to break down within the first month is quite something else. Guess that's the most fundamental expectation when someone purchases a new car? To run without getting stranded on the road. Already was a big leap of faith with friends and family advising against the gearbox! Zac says this is normal, they are working to get the cars back on the road and the number of breakdowns are less than expected for a new launch. Strangely - this is despite high pricing and less features in the name of superior Euro quality! And VW doesn't have a Zac Hollis for owners to reach out. Is this the end of the Taigun for me? Not sure. But not sure of taking the initial batch either! Will anyways take the wife to see the car when it arrives in showrooms and if it doesnt make her fall head over heels in love (and me with the price) - will re-asses the purchase for Jan-Feb. Hope VW learns from Skoda before then - may be they have already learned and will correct before launch. Not sure if I want to find out the hard way!

I have been following your conundrum for quite some time via your posts on various threads. I think it began with you booking the XUV 300 when it was launched. My humble suggestion to you would be to wait till the year end and get the best possible discounts on the Compass. Not the Sport model but the Longitude and drive happily a D segment diesel SUV with a very decent feature set. For all we know, this might be your last chance of owning a diesel whereas those TSIs will be there aplenty the next time around. Yes, it is easy for me to say this since I am not the one who is gonna be spending the moolah but as long as you are fine with a manual, the Compass it should be. At the very least, you might get better discounts on the Sport variant. An Indianised VAG product with multiple failures(questionable reliability?), average A.S.S. and the hanging sword called DQ200 is not really appealing to me as a package, especially for someone who can stretch for the Compass.", 31st August 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Mumbai,"1,214","3,770"

But I'm even more sketipal about the numbers that VAG twins can achieve. Let me explain with approximate figures and some assumptions. - Monthly sales for C Segment Compact SUV is about 25000 units every month. - Let's assume over optimistically 20% Growth in the coming year, i.e. 30000 units every month. - Today, about 55-60% sales in the segment are Diesel cars. Let's Assume Petrol gains more popularity with BS6, reduced gap in diesel prices and Diesel ban in Delhi. - Out of 30000, say petrol share grows to 50%.i.e.15000 will be Petrol cars. - This 15000 (over optimistic) number is shared between Creta, Seltos, Hector, Kushaq and upcoming XUV700, Astor & Taigun (no petrol Harrier). - Let's assume all the existing cars lose 25% share to new entrants (again over optimistic). Creta: share today 50%, share tomorrow 37.5% = 15000 * 37.5% = 5625 units Seltos: Share today 35%, share tomorrow 22.5% = 15000 * 22.5% = 3375 units Hector: 15% market share today (no Harrier Petrol), which let's say goes down to 5% only = 15000 * 5% = 750 units - Out of 15000 petrol compact SUV segment, Total combined share of existing cars falls to 65% (9750 units) and assume remaining 35% (5250 units) is to be shared by Kushaq, Taigun, XUV700 & Astor. - Now compare the aggresive pricing and steller feature list (including ADAS) of XUV700 and Astor (coming only in petrol) with so called premium Pricing & sub par feature list of VAG twins. Over optimistic: let's divide remaining 5250 units equally among these 4 cars by forgetting super value proposition of XUV & Astor. Still VAG twins can do max 2600 units a month. Optimistic: Considering better value proposition, let's assume XUV700 does 1500 units and Astor does 2000 units, it leaves only 1750 units month for VAG twins. Realistic: Segment may not grow by 20% in an year. In the segment, Creta/Seltos will hardly lose 25% market share. And looking at initial impressions, XUV/Astor will definitely be future stars. Where will Kushaq & Taigun gain the numbers from? My realistic guess is twins will sell 1500 units a month together.

We felt overpriced to what its offering. It can seat only floor due to high floor hump. SA says its for safety. Being a CBU, we’re unsure on the part availability and service costs after factoring in Extended warranty. Creta SX(O) petrol: Family loved the features as its full of bells and whistles. Five can easily sit comfortably in the back.I personally didn’t like the style, which will take a back seat when it comes to family preferences. Ride was fine but definitely not as fun as 1.5TSI. Booked on 5th July for Lava Orange. Delivery dates are not known its definitely more than 6months as they will start manufacturing the car only if they receive 100 bookings for same color. Got a new update from SA that they’re expecting further delays due to production issues. I presume even Hyundai is facing semi conductor shortage. Thinking to get rid of idea to own create due to these delays. Kushaq: Desperately waited for it for months together. Family didn’t find the rear seat comfortable because of the hard plastics in the corners. Also once i understood that it doesn’t get 6 airbags, immediately dropped the idea of looking at it and stopped following the thread. Taigun: Loved the styling and engine combination as I’ve already TD Troc it'll be fun for sure. Joined the Taigun squad after paying booking amount and our preview is scheduled on 11th Sept at Novotel. I am unsure on the rear seat comfort in Taigun. Big let down if it turns out to be same as its sibling. Here comes the major conflict point of EPC failures, whether Taigun will also sees the same fate as that of Kushaq. I do not want to end up owning a lemon. Hector, Harrier, Compass were not considered because of its high GC as my Mom finds it difficult to occupy back seat.

Welcome to the forum. Having personally seen both the T-roc (driven) and Taigun (seen exterior and interior), I can tell you that the two are different cars with the same 1.5 TSI. There is no denying the fact that EPC issues have dented the much awaited India 2.0 push, and I would rather wait out the initial few batches of these cars than being one of those who face the EPC error and a stalled car in the middle of a trip or on my way to work.", 5th September 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Gandhinagar,216,757

We felt overpriced to what its offering. It can seat only floor due to high floor hump. SA says its for safety. Being a CBU, were unsure on the part availability and service costs after factoring in Extended warranty. Creta SX(O) petrol: Family loved the features as its full of bells and whistles. Five can easily sit comfortably in the back.I personally didnt like the style, which will take a back seat when it comes to family preferences. Ride was fine but definitely not as fun as 1.5TSI. Booked on 5th July for Lava Orange. Delivery dates are not known its definitely more than 6months as they will start manufacturing the car only if they receive 100 bookings for same color. Got a new update from SA that theyre expecting further delays due to production issues. I presume even Hyundai is facing semi conductor shortage. Thinking to get rid of idea to own create due to these delays. Kushaq: Desperately waited for it for months together. Family didnt find the rear seat comfortable because of the hard plastics in the corners. Also once i understood that it doesnt get 6 airbags, immediately dropped the idea of looking at it and stopped following the thread. Taigun: Loved the styling and engine combination as Ive already TD Troc it'll be fun for sure. Joined the Taigun squad after paying booking amount and our preview is scheduled on 11th Sept at Novotel. I am unsure on the rear seat comfort in Taigun. Big let down if it turns out to be same as its sibling. Here comes the major conflict point of EPC failures, whether Taigun will also sees the same fate as that of Kushaq. I do not want to end up owning a lemon. Hector, Harrier, Compass were not considered because of its high GC as my Mom finds it difficult to occupy back seat. Seltos is also out of picture due to its safety rating and poor build. Already owning 5th Gen city in family. PS : City is a masterpiece for sure. Just go right ahead and buy the TROC. Stay away from the Creta as you did for the Seltos mainly because they are built on the same platform. So safety and build will not be different at all. Also newer Hyundais and Kias are loaded with so many brake issues and other quality issues like paint peel and what not. I know that the TROC is overpriced. But the TROC is a CBU and it offers 5 star Euro NCAP rating, which is a must for family. Also I don't think that spare parts will be an issue as CBU and CKD cars have imported parts. Also Skoda's and VW's CKD cars are selling way lower than the CBU 2500 limit. So there is no need to worry about the spare parts issue. Also the TROC has the same engine in the Taigun. If you are using it for limited use or long trips, then it is a great buy. Use the City for city commutes as the TROC has a DQ200 which is very notorious in terms of reliability. Another option you can wait for is the MG Astor. It will get too many safety features and will be comfy enough for your family. The safety of the Astor will be good enough as the ZS EV got 5 stars in Euro NCAP and the ZS petrol got 4 stars in ASEAN NCAP. I know it's India spec. But I assume MG being a Chinese owned brand, double standards in terms of safety from them is very unlikely. If you can digest the Chinese thing then you can go ahead with the Astor.", 5th September 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Bengaluru,54,131

You can go ahead with a pre owned Audi diesel. Even though VAG discontinued their all TDIs I don't think spare parts will be a problem as majority of VWAG cars sold in India in the past were TDIs. Also TDIs are very reliable engines. But stay away from the 1.4 TSI variants of the Q3, A3 and A4 as the 1.4 TSI is a garbage in terms of reliability. There are some videos saying that the 1.4 TSI is unreliable. Also stay away from the Q3 and A3 as they are entry level models and are built on the TROC's platform. They feel like a VW rather than an Audi. If you get a used A4 diesel then go ahead with it. The A4 diesel especially from 2016 has been the best luxury diesel sedan for comfort oriented ones. It is a great upgrade from your Polo. Or else, you can hard negotiate a TROC. If budget is your concern then pre owned Audi is the option. But don't go for the Q3, A3 and the 1.4 TSI variants of the A4. Just find a pre owned A4 diesel in your budget.", 5th September 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Bengaluru,54,131

372, Sunderdeep , 13:24 ,BHPian,"As a current 2020 VW T-Roc owner, I feel little happier that I didn't wait for VW Taigun. VW/Skoda group had all time in the world to come up with aspirational products after relying too much on Polo/Rapid for a decade. Rather they come up with half baked Taigun & Kushaq that are neither here nor there kind of cars. I would expect VW Taigun to sell around 3500 units pm in initial months and then finally settle to 2000-2500 units once initial buzz is over. VW should have taken a leaf out of Polo's success despite being a decade old that it is almost a perfect car fundamentally. You can complain about some modern features missing but that car still holds a great value if driving dynamics and overall durability of parts is considered. My father has just replaced his 11 years old Wagon R with a Polo Trendline because of the quality inside/out despite its shortcomings. He wasn't very impressed with Ignis and Tiago in comparison. VW Taigun lacks the aspirational value of Rs 18 lacs car. In one of my videos on Youtube, I have raised multiple points where Taigun lacks as compared to T-Roc in insulation, plastic cladding, convenience features, panoramic sunroof and overall build quality & feel. I would not have point fingers on Taigun if they were not providing a better quality T-Cross in China at almost same price. Chinese T-Cross cover all negative aspects like better cladding, aero-twin wipers, better insulation and panoramic sunroof; perhaps look a little more premium too. With TDIs not there, missing panoramic sunroof, size tad smaller than Korean Twins; European Twins will find it little hard to make a dent in the sales of Mid-Size SUV segment. Having said that, I really want VW/Skoda to succeed in 2.0 Strategy by launching some exciting cars like Virtus, Slavia, New Gen Polo, Golf, Tiguan, Jetta etc without compromising a bit on the quality fundamentals that Europeans are known for. Idea should be to attract urban customers with quality by keeping rates at par with Koreans/Japanese with little less equipment on offer. It will be interesting to see if VW can price Taigun base variant a little under 10 lacs to attract some prospect buyers of compact SUVs too and price 1.5 TSI variants within 14.50-16.50 lacs to attract buyers that look for performance but aren't ready to trust Koreans for their questionable safety & dynamics. Pricing definitely will play a major role for Taigun's success.", 6th September 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Ludhiana,29,111

374, Lalitha Venkat , 14:33 ,BHPian," Quote: Originally Posted by 07CR Only thing that could make the car sell is it's driving dynamics. But apart from that these underachieve in all other aspects WRT competition. A silver lining for someone still interested in the VW twins is the used car market. Once the Astor and XUV700 are out, there could be hordes of people selling their Kushaq/Taigun, and could result in some very good deals. The MQB IN platform is largely the same as MQB platform except for some changes for Indian conditions mainly climatic controls and increase in back seat space (wheel base) to suit Indian conditions. The engine, gear box and the suspension are same. The cost cutting which is being widely bashed on the forum is on localization of parts which is made in India and saves on import duty and is further benefited through cheap labour as compared to European factories. The specifications are the same and most of the Tier 2/3 producers are the same for eg WABCO will produce brakes/ ABS for all companies like Ford, Tata, Jeep, Maruti and VW based on customer specification in their plants in India. The specifications don't change significantly as design is a key cost and sampling is a 24 month exercise. The T-Roc which is an imported CBU made in Europe also has hard plastics. That is by design and more to do with aesthetics and product positioning. VW has SUV to sell in the 30 L plus price bracket and they will want some differentiation for that segment. The price difference you pay for T-ROC and Taigun is the impact of local sourcing and savings in customs duty that is levied on the CBU apart from few features that is provided to some who has spent 8-10 L more. The core of the car is same. Every brand will aspire for more localization in order to drive efficiencies. On the insulation front also please see what our official review reads, ''The car's engine is refined for the most part of the time until it crosses 5,000 RPM when it gets Boomy"". Guys, do you think a normal person is going to rev and cross 5,000 rpm in a typical drive. A person who revs the car to redline does it for thrill of hearing the sound of the engine and he will not like it insulated. The insulation below bonnet and adding acoustics glasses will increase costs by INR 7,500 to 75,000. The XUV 700 IMHO is a competition to Creta/ Compass and not Kushaq/ Tiguan. The size and segments are different . Some one who wants to buy Sonnet/ Venue will look at Kushaq/ Tiguan. There are a lot of users who want a SUV stance but not the size and AWD etc. Those are the target market for these cars. VAG group also understands this. That's why they have aspired to capture only 5% market share within 2025 after investing 8,000 crores (Tata PV has more than 10% market share before Safari hit the market ) Of the 8,000 crore one portion would have come to MQB IN and the rest gone for MQB platform which is used for exports from India. None of the German companies can produce price competitive products in India as their pay is significantly higher. Please Google the Union Salary settlement for Bosch that was fixed in 2018. Your jaws will drop. EPC issue may deter this forum's readers from buying the car but not the general public.

So they dropped their standards, or had to? But by this much, nobody could have guessed! Even the spares/servicing costs had astounded my friend who bought the first Vento (And quickly sold it). That was the fastest exit I'd seen The cost has two aspects. The material and labour +Overheads. On the material level, while the input costs can not be controlled, the automotive makers use the concept of VE-Value engineering. They maintain the functionality as constant and try and play around with the engineering side - use of substitutes which dont impair function. The other thing they do is push the parts to component manufacturers there by eliminating high labour and overhead costs. They also push component makers to give productivity gains as cost reductions year on year. This is not about VAG alone, who ever is mass market they do the same. I did not have any issues with my Vento and i am using it for the last 6 years. Your friend selling his Vento has nothing do with this as he would have bought some other car which is also manufactured in the same way. All I am saying is that they would have developed local suppliers and replaced the imported guys or MNC suppliers in India. If you are selling Ice cream in Chowpatty beach your set up cant be like Haggen Dazs. Please note i am not commenting on the taste factor which is personal. I am just bringing in the overheads set up. Please dont say that local cart vendor gives better taste. People have different appreciation of value and costs. I still abhor the idea of selling my Vento as its a pleasure to drive. Ps: I dont hold any equity stake in VAG:", 8th September 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Chennai,151,220

394, GautamJ , 20:09 ,BHPian," I managed to visit JW Marriott for VW Taigun Preview. It was well coordinated, there was an executive for everyone prospective buyer and cars were sanitised regularly as per norms. BTW, one of the executive himself agreed than M&M XUV 7OO is coming with all guns and Taigun will face heat Pros :- 1. Sheet Metal, and the fit and finish were to VW standards. 2. HU touch was quite good, a bit confusing to control initially, but got hang of it after a while. 3. Seats are firm and supportive. 4. Crisp 8 Digital IC (Note: It is NOT the Virtual Cockpit which comes in MQB VAGs) 5. Though looks are subjective, I find it to be non-offensive and timeless. Cons :- 1. 205/55 R17 GoodYear TripleMax tyres! Odd size with no other brand available and GoodYears are known for tyre bursts. 2. Sound Quality is pathetic (tried all settings), the worst I have experienced till date. My 4 year old Rapid with just 4 OEM speakers sounds way better. 3. Front seat rails extend further back and seems to be a safety hazard. (Pic attached for reference) 4. Driver Seat for my height was just fine. But anyone shorter than 56 might feel seat low. 5. Interior quality isnt up to VW standards. Cheap headliner and Sunroof is a tad wider than my Ford EcoSport.

396, CircleOfLife , 02:39 ,BHPian,This thread is relatively seen less action compared to Kushaq. Assuming fireworks are reserved for price reveal. Volkswagen need to get the customer walk in that door and walk out with four wheels and big smile. Only way to do this getting the pricing bang on sweet spot. It is easier said than done for the group. This is where MG is going to try capitalise with Astor and XUV700 comes out with blazing guns. With Ford exiting there is a opportunity to fill some space and learn lessons. Hyderabad preview event didnt seem organised that well. Cars werent getting sanatized regularly. There werent enough representatives to talk to potential customers. Not enough distancing. From the time I started to plonk in the hard earned money on a car always had been the Volkswagen. Yes 5 cars owned over this period. With that perspective of ownership the natural evolution for upgrade would been something from the group. Taigun being one of the contenders. Now when Volkswagen says localization I do expect that means local sourcing not leaving out quint essential features. 1) No damping material under the hood. if you are trying to say our product is premium then think premium and go that extra mile. 2) One touch up and down removed from back door that also means no anti pinch feature. Kids sit mostly in the back seat ans some hot shot thought these are not needed. Yes with this they are high on safety. 3) Why not frameless wipers? 4) under body protection isnt end to end. This is something adds peace of mind. 5) ventilated seats. Hello back would have certainly appreciated it. 6) Why not provide full length sunroof. Yes we love chrome and panaromic sunroof. Later being the preference. Comments reserved on headlight. This is one of the sore points on highway drives. In current form it looks like half baked product. Updates will trickle down in next iteration. Is it still under consideration. Yes for that 1.5 engine only. I will be looking closely at MG too. I wished they would have gone whole 9 yards. Hoping enough numbers are achieved for the group to be sustainable over the years.

It won't cover the DSG by design because of the dry clutch which in Indian weather and driving conditions, tends to heat. The under body seems weird. it is one thing that there is no hood liner but on the sides inside the bonnet are some VERY sharp metal flanges which is absolutely absurd. There is no covering at all and if you feel that flange, trust me you will get cut. The complete lack of any insulation, rubberised protection inside the bonnet is ridiculous. Can be done individually but I would have expected it from the factory. Fit, finish, sheet metal, paint quality, everything else is as good.

404, rkaria1970 , 18:54 ,Newbie,"Hi Guys, So after contemplating the VW Taigun as my next car for which I had alreday paid the booking amount, I cancelled the same today and booked the Tata Harrier AT (XZA Model). The Skoda Kushaq's EPS issue has completely ruined the proposition for me wrt the German cars. I TDed the Harrier a couple of times in the last 2 weeks and was extremely happy with the car's performance. I was very apprehensive about the driving ease of the harrier in the Mumbai traffic, but I was surprised how easy it was to maneuver the car in BTB traffic. I am porting from the 2017 scross, which also has a hydroliic stearing and a diesel engine and seems that put me at ease with this gentle giant. Delivery is expected on the 1st day of Navratra, 7th October. I hope the kind folks of TeamBHP will guide me in my queries, so here are a few :- 1) How are the OEM 3D Mats or any other suggestions? 2) I have gone with the White Dual Tone colour, I am thinking of installing the OEM roof rails, but in some videos that I saw, the roof rail colour is black which would be subdued due the the black rooftop. Are there any OEM options for steel or metallic colour roof rails? , are after market RRs a good option as I want a contrasting color option for the black roof.

Not everyone has the luxury to drive bigger footprint car like XUV 700 in our traffic jams, some like mid-size fun to drive crossovers where Taigun would pitch in. For Astor, let's wait for the drive reviews and the initial impressions to come in, it sure looks premium and feature loaded but how well it is to drive is to be seen. The more powerful 1.3 Turbo coming won't have any manual which is again a downer when it comes to enthusiasts who like taking the control themselves.

I wished they would have gone whole 9 yards. Hoping enough numbers are achieved for the group to be sustainable over the years. There needs to be enough players in market with their inherent strength. Shortened the quote to capture the main points IMHO. I find myself in a similar situation. I have been a die-hard VW India loyalist since the very beginning of the brand in India. Over these years my family and I have owned close to 4 VW cars. Back in the day when buying a VW, it was a given that you might miss out on some 'nice-to-have' features but the build and finish quality of the car would be the very best with close to no expenses spared. Upon seeing the Taigun, I share the same view as many of the BHPians, the overall finish and quality are nowhere close to what we expect out of a VW. Of course, the Taigun is a VW so yes it will have a decent level of quality but it is nowhere close to the old tank-like models that VW has been offering from their stable. On the other hand, one can't deny that this has probably been one of the most feature-loaded VWs ever on offer on the Indian market. In my head, it seems to be the classic features vs quality tradeoff. The Taigun is definitely off my list right now, will go and preview the Kushaq in the coming weeks to see if there are any striking differences or 'deal makers' for me as compared to the Taigun.

There has never been any issue with warranty The warranty repairs get rejected only when the company(Brand) is trying to save a few bucks. The dealer stands to benefit from replacing stuff in warranty because it gives them sales/profits. Say, if you go in to get something replaced under warranty and the company refuses to honor the warranty citing some trivial reason like a different tyre size or third party audio system, would you still get it done in the company service centre or from a FNG who would use OEM parts and yet you'll get charged substantially less? In my case, my Terrao's warranty got rejected because i somehow skipped getting my car serviced from the company at the 30,000km mark. Remember, the warranty repairs are free for the customer, but the dealer gets a good profit from the company. But my issue was with the front right shocker, which has nothing to do with regular/timely service. Similarly if your navigation system had some issues, and the company rejected the warranty claim citing an up-size tyre, then there's no co-relation between the two, it's just the brand being greedy and taking the customer for a ride. But if you installed an after-market lighting system by splicing wires and using relays and what not, or a music system from an unprofessional shop where they use low-quality wires, hook up the power directly from the battery, don't do proper earthing, etc, then the company will most definitely reject the warranty claims arising after that and it would be right.", 14th September 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Jodhpur,109,140

426, AshwinRS , 16:34 ,BHPian,"Thought I'd pitch in my first views of the Taigun 1.5 DSG as well. On Sunday (12.09.2021) my service advisor at VW Noida informed me that a Taigun has been received by their Patparganj showroom. I was told that I can go and have a look at it. Since I am in the market for a CSUV (preferably) with a budget of 15L, I also had a look and a test drive of the Nexon as well on Sunday after which, I visited the Patparganj showroom. I had also visited the Skoda showroom to check out the Kushaq. We already have a Kia Seltos in our extended family - so I had a fair idea of the competition. XUV7OO is not in consideration, too big for my needs. My opinions are solely based on how the Taigun made me feel. Without any person waiting in line to see the car, I spent a fair amount of time inside the Taigun and walking around it. - Off the bat, the car looked smart! No extra bulge here or there to make it look bigger than what it actually is. Looked chiseled. However, the chrome bit was a little too much for my liking. - The dimensions seemed good for city use as well as highway runs. - The first touch point i.e., the feel of the door handles was good, the pull mechanism to open the door, felt of good quality. Better than many other cars. - As I stepped in the Taigun, it was definitely way above the quality/fit and finish of Nexon and at par or +1 on Seltos as well as the Kushaq (my personal opinion). - The interiors were refreshing (read: no floating touchscreens) with nicely integrated infotainment system and switches. Particularly liked it since these days it's common to have huge screens staring back at you - I'm not a big fan of huge screens in the car. - The seat were comfortable, rear leg room was more than enough for two, can have little kid in the middle seat as well! - The perceived build quality felt maybe a notch below than the older VWs, but not a deal breaker since it feels better built than it's direct competitors. The Taigun did give me a positive feel, a car that I can live with (Nexon was surely not a car I could live with). And being familiar with the VWs (we have a Vento 1.6 Highline-2011 and a Polo 1.2 TDI Highline-2015), Taigun felt like home. Could possibly be the upgrade the Polo owners are looking for. Also, I noticed that the headlight only houses one LED set up and the other ones are just for the looks (as per the sales representative)! Weird! Why? Overall, if priced decently, Taigun will be able to create a niché for itself. VW has the product, let's see if they're able to deliver it at a price point tempting enough to give in! I'm on the fence, waiting for the price reveal and the EPC issues to be resolved! Can't wait to test drive it. Parting note: I don't know if any other VW owner feels this way or not - but once you experience a VW, other similarly placed cars just don't make the cut! Let's see where I end up!

434, CarBorne , 00:44 ,BHPian,"I got a call from local VW showroom in Gurgaon (the one on MG road) informing me about the availability to checkout. Both me and my better half were waiting for the moment for quite some time. I being a car enthusiast have been waiting for the right care for the past 3 months, which is testing the patience levels of the better half. Upon arrival, got to know that they haven't put it on display yet, but are giving the previews in the basement. It was a GT line in Curcuma Yellow colour. Sharing my initial impressions: 1. Looks and road presence: Taigun lives upto the standard VW design statement of fuss-free clean looks. The exact words of the wife were ""This is a clean no nonsense design"". Classic german work here. The tail light section didn't feel odd or garish in the yellow colour. I was apprehensive about the excessive chrome, but in the limited light of basement it didn't feel like an eyesore. It is a smart looking car, more suited to my personal preference. Nothing much to write about road presence. It doesn't have the presence. I would say, it does make up for the lack of presence with the clean design/smart stance. A weird way to put it, it can be thoughts of as a Q3 of the segment when Q5,X3 are Harriers and Seltos. 2. Interior Quality: The first impressions were positive. It felt better than Kushaq - could be attributed to the smooth feel of the panel on dashboard where Kushaq has the golf ball kind of pattern. The hard plastics are there, but don't feel excessively rough. The upper half of the cabin is well put in terms of fit. Really liked the way touch screen has been integrated in dash. Instrument cluster - the digital instrument cluster looks alright in dark. It did lack the full fledged virtual cockpit with virtual dials, but the display is bright and easy to read. Having a full fledged cluster would have been great. I found the seats to be less supportive than Kushaq for driver and copassenger - could be down to the fact that one is leather and other was fabric. Having recently driven a Harrier for a long drive, the cabin felt a snug fit. Roof lining and the size of sunroof is same as Kushaq. Nothing much to write home about. Few of the interesting bits I noted: 1. The headlamp clusters have a pair of barrels each. The inner barrel aren't projectors and seem like a reflector setup. I couldn't turn them on after trying all the settings neither could the sales agent. Seems like they are dummies - quite a big downer for me personally (will be trivial for most of the other members) 2. I had turned on the engine for 5 odd minutes. However, the bonnet had heated up a lot to the extent that it was uncomfortable to touch for more than few seconds at a stretch. Seemed odd as this shouldn't the case. 3. Music system is inferior than Kushaq's. The lack of subwoofer was quite evident. Even at high volume the thump of bass was missing. 4. The other cost cutting measures like the rear wind shield wiper are an eyesore. Also checked T-Roc, and probably I don't have the discerning eye, but I didn't feel much difference in build quality. The sales rep was quite aggressive in pushing us to do a booking - probably the truth behind the 9k pre-bookings on Taigun. However, didn't go ahead as the prices are yet to be announced, not sure between Kushaq/Taigun, and finally not sure if I should go for either of these. There is no denying that these are half baked overpriced products. Will have to go for these only because of TINA. Hoping that 23rd september throws up a surprise like 15th August. Had also checked out Jeep Compass and would have gone for that had the budget permitted.", 15th September 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Gurgaon,31,67

Its not a Apple to Apple comparison between CBU and locally built (TROC vs Taigun or Kushaq). They are priced and positioned differently. This difference in quality will be felt across any brand for CBU vs Local manufacturing. Vento or Rapid or Polo VS Taigun or Kushaq yes you can feel the difference in interior quality and some areas of sheet metal. Common theme of hard plastics carry forward. Seats are a area of complain compared to siblings. Are the recent crash test norms also having some part to play here in terms of sheet metal? Its same 1.5 engine in TROC vs Kushaq. Did the engine performance felt any different? Remember long term vision for Volkswagen is to export this model to select markets hence there will be some benchmarks that will be met.

Today had some leisure time, so visited the showroom and checked out the vehicle extensively along with a short drive. Since most of the points were already discussed here I'll brief up my observations and they are in comparison with my 2019 Vento & 2021 Seltos GTX+. Interior: - Leg room is good in both front & rear. - Loved the new steering wheel controls compared to the vento. - Ingress and Egress will be easier compared to Seltos for older people. - I'm a bit heavy and to me taigun is Strictly a 4-seater no 2-ways about it, for a moment I felt it like polo with larger legroom. - Boot space is decent but high loading lip can be cumbersome at-least for me. - The spare wheel is a size smaller and you don't get a sub-woofer. - Virtual cockpit is sharp and easily readable but the way the things are laid out it needs a little getting used to. - Ambient lighting is good compared to seltos. - Sunroof is a bit larger than seltos but as mentioned by someone earlier, it is a bit exposed. - The roof liner doesn't seem well put in some places and the dummy in place of sunglass holder isn't pleasing to look at. - The AC vents seem like they are made of recycled plastic and no were close to VW's quality. - The AC controls are very slick & sensitive, it's so sensitive that you might mess with it while shifting gears(loved it though). - The cabin light switches are hard to press and disappointing with a creak noise every time you operate. - The sliding armrest cover is fully usable compared to seltos. Exterior: - The doors require some effort to fully open, typical VW. - The design is subjective and minus the chrome on the bumper I loved the Front look(same in case of my Seltos). - The headlights look like they'll do a pretty good job in non-rain drives. - The empty barrel on the headlight is confusing even the VW guys don't have any idea about it's purpose. - The fog lights are halogens and will serve the purpose & live up to it's name. - The rear looks very good with the continuous led strip. - Lack of front parking cannot be excused. - The engine bay is pretty full. The Drive: - Steering is light n nimble(almost like my seltos, but definitely way lighter than my vento 1.6 MPi) boon in city drives, doubt if it'd weigh up well enough at highway speeds. - The engine feels eager and doesn't hesitate at crawling speeds. - As always DSG is seemless in shifts. - Paddle shifter is spot on, tap it and manual mode is engaged. - Cabin feels well insulated but you can feel the engine running(I visited the showroom in my friend's 2009 Civic so I did hear the 1.5 TSI) . - The auto start/stop works really well, Can be annoying at times when shifting from D to R the engine sleeps when you cross N and comes back giving a jerk when you reach R. - To me taigun was very predictable in tight spots compared to seltos, but seltos makes up for it with 360' camera to some level. - Can't really comment on the suspension but it seemed a tad firmer(maybe due to incorrect tyre pressure also). Overall, the vehicle seems decently put with good amount of places with cost cuttings. Taigun looks small'ish even for a C-SUV. Pricing will play a humongous role in sales figures or at the least an ""introductory price"" will aid IMHO. I might book the 1.5 AT if the price is right.", 16th September 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Tirunelveli,21,67

464, GeeTee TSI , 15:07 ,Senior - BHPian,"Checked out the Taigun today at PPS Motors, Thanisandra. Basically standstill at the parking yard but with the engine on, I could spend time with a GT variant. Mr Krishna from sales was not intrusive at all but responsive when required The cross hatch height makes ingress and egress just right both at front and rear. Excellent packaging with comfortable seating all round, this aspect seemed superior to even the T-Roc notwithstanding the latter's larger footprint. Rear door aperture is wide and two 6 footers back to back have more than adequate room. The Taigun's infotainment screen is just awesome with even the bright mid day sun directly falling on the screen not affecting the contrast/visibility. The (so called) digital instrument cluster sadly doesn't seem to have an option to replicate both speedo and tacho dials at the same time. Loved the perforated leather steering wheel which felt premium. Headlamp cluster is baffling with a dummy reflector next to the outer LED projectors, just doesn't agree with one's OCD.

465, pranavsh , 17:54 ,Newbie,"Honestly, with the new MG Astor coming in and the Seltos GTX+ offering a much better interior, its high time VW bucks up. They have been doing the same thing for years in India which is to focus a lot on cost cutting even at the segment range and try and advertise it as the best thing in the market at that price. Its unacceptable to me that VW has focused so much on the exterior styling and given much less importance to the cabin feel. With so many hard plastics, a poor quality roof line, and just not a well polished interior, the Taigun is looking more and more like a car thats only USP is its drivability. Coming from a Polo GT, I was quite keen on seeing what the interiors look like but alas, its just like a beefed up Polo at this point. Also, why did they remove the lovely horn that existed in all the lower end VW Group vehicles and replace it with this basic horn? It might seem small but I really enjoy the trumpet horn.

P.S - I some time still admire the red Polo's parked on the roadside:-) I would echo the same sentiments and agree with each and every word you have penned down. The way I looked at MG Astor was freaking well executed interiors. There is a feel of premium and appear as couple of segment above. If MG would have provided ventilated seats in top variant then there is no reason to complain. If they undercut Taigun, which they will, then not sure how Volkswagen justify premium tag. Our engines are superior or German heritage? Tail lamps each one of the vehicles have their own appeal. Depending on individual choice. I liked both of them. Rear leg space seemed better in Taigun & Kushaq than MG Astor. Volkswagen will age better and MG Astor which is in mid lifecycle update might see a new design 2-3 years down the line. On execution stand point liked the way MG india has executed strategy rather than Volkswagen. Advertisement ""Hustle mode on"" might prove ""Hustle to sell going forward"". Volkswagen campaign didn't connect with me. Marketing team is just burning cash. Such prolonged hangover doesn't help. . Have almost lost interest. MG on other hand did virtual launch, got the vehicles to showroom sooner, media drives starting on 26 September and mostly will release prices and start booking by 01 October. That is how you keep the customer engaged. I have been customer of Volkswagen for decade now. Showroom experience at MG was lot nicer. MG hector and MG ZS EV comes with 5 year warranty, going by the trend MG might offer the same for Astor. This is one more trump card over volkswagen warranty of 4 years. There will be ADAS and Non ADAS version to satisfy needs of all types of buyers. Will significantly come at different price points. Not many have emphasize on ACC(Adaptive cruise control). One you start using it and get a hang of it you will always expect this function to be there in your next car. Couple of year down the lane. might become standard in this segment of cars. Underbody cladding: Executed very well in Astor then half hearted attempt in Taigun. Shocking Volkswagen has not prioritized this. All said above not everything is rosy with MG Astor. Reverse camera feed quality looked very low resolution. There are adaptive guidelines though. Live feed from turn signals is on media unit rather than instrument console. Which is weird. AI assistant (looked like after thought product) was very laggy and didn't respond correctly in the display car. Hope such glitches don't exist in ADAS Privacy and data issues will always be back of mind. What ever the management can say ally such fears, but one just can't trust. More the advance technology then more are the chances of failures. MG Astor has lot of sensors and radars. Front end or rear ending repairs might be expensive affair. Wonder insurance companies will charge more premium. Last but not the least, ever changing dynamic with the neighbors will have a huge impact on survival of brand and company. Customer sentiments and how future government policies will decide it's fate. Looks like it is a race to finish line. Boils down to test drives and pricing. This will put final nail in the coffin. Next 3 weeks will be one of the most interesting weeks in this segment with XUV700 joining the race. Hold on to your seats, catch a popcorn, go through tons of reviews, open your excel sheets and start jolting down features vs requirements list. If you are still unable to decide then go with your heart.", 20th September 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Hyd,340,682

Good to see ESC and multi-collision brakes standard, although I'm surprised they didn't try undercutting the Kushaq considering lacklustre market response. Either razor-thin margins (base variant is pretty well-specced) or they're not looking for the sales. A Trendline variant may not have sold much but the low sticker price would have avoided an image for being overpriced. My guess is that Volkswagen's global management doesn't allow them to launch new models without ESC etc. anymore, so they just skipped the base variant and targeted the Seltos HTK/Creta EX (or whatever the second-from-base variants are called). I'm not sure why, but I don't think 'Topline' is a nice name. Doesn't have a nice ring to it. Highline Plus would have been nicer in my opinion. I'm disappointed they didn't sponsor a Global NCAP test and have the results revealed at launch. I understand Global NCAP is a third-party organisation and not exactly an India-specific NCAP, but it would have been a huge plus if they were able to advertise a good rating at launch, especially considering the XUV700 is rumoured to launch with a top rating, and there are rumours floating around about the Astor too. Volkswagen in Latin America, for instance, sponsors a test before the launch of every new model and has the results announced a few days after the launch. LatinNCAP praises them for committing to a five-star fleet. I'm surprised they aren't doing it here, considering they have sponsored tests for the Polo in the past.

Definitely a better competitor to the Koreans. VW ownership experience/ brand is also perceived to be better in general so should work in the Taigun's favour. We all tend to compare the variant strategy of other brands to that of Hyundai-Kia's which is unparalleled in its aggressiveness. You'll never get the 20+ different combinations of variants, gearboxes and engines in anyone but the Korean twins and comparing only that aspect will inevitably lead to disappointment. Plus I think both VW and Skoda are keeping a couple of variants under the covers for now so that they can unveil them later to maintain brand recall. All in all I think this should be more of a success as compared to the Kushaq because of the styling, brand and price. But of course only time and real sales will tell who won this bout.

Personally - I am not at all excited about the GT Manual. It skips a LOT of features that even budget hatchbacks get and will still cost 17-18 lakhs on road.

I agree, however there might not be enough of a demand for automatics in the lower variants for VW to consider having an AT throughout its range. A report in early 2020 suggested that only 20% of the overall market is AT cars and that includes the AMTs in your smaller hatches. According to Kia only 30% of the Seltos audience opts for the AT and that is after them being one of the first companies to offer a proper AT in a lower-mid variant. Hyundai and Kia with their market research is probably the best analysis an OEM could have to ascertain the needs of your target audience and VW seems to have managed to address that. Plus from my personal experience, the demographic which would go for the most affordable variant quite often isn't bothered about transmission choice and values other comfort oriented features like a proper infotainment system/ leather seats etc. From what I've noticed it's usually people who would otherwise be shopping in a segment below stretching their budget to get a ""bigger"" car.

588, VRJ , 18:29 ,BHPian,"Checked out the Taigun today. A good friend of mine wanted to pick up the Polo and I insisted to wait for the Taigun because the Polo has zero space at the rear. I liked the Taigun. It looks and feels better than the Kushaq. It’s the same exterior body, but somehow the Taigun feels better. The car felt solid. The doors have that VW thud. Don’t know what to make of it, but it feels good. Not one piece of metal that you can push down with your finger. Test drive begins next week. I’m excited to test drive the 1.5 DSG. The suspension and the engine transmission combo has got rave reviews and I’m eager to get behind the wheel. Exteriors: The front is alright. The grille is set a bit down and the bonnet has a sharp fall at the beginning. The side profile is nice. Nice creases. The rear is definitely interesting. I didn’t like it initially when I saw the pictures, however, I really liked it outside in the flesh. Gives the Taigun a distinct personality. In comparison, the rear of the Kushaq is very plain jain and boring. The 17 inch alloys are nice as well. No complaints in the exterior looks department. I love the yellow shade. I probably would never buy such a shade, but it looked stellar with all the fancy lights in the showroom. Interiors: This is where I was impressed the most. I never owned a VW before. My benchmark of comparison is our 2018 Fortuner. I feel the Taigun is miles ahead of the Kushaq. It looked and felt richer. The steering is soo light and looked upmarket. I’ve read a few complains about the digital instrument cluster here in the forum. Trust me guys, it is very clear and it is a good display. I initially thought it was a sticker on the screen, but it wasn’t. Might not be as good as the one in the Superb, but its definitely a good one and you won’t be disappointed. The infotainment screen man. Crystal clear . I’m more of a ‘get the basics right and not give a damn about the screen’ kind of a guy, but this one just draws your attention. You’ll love it. Wireless Apple CarPlay was a breeze. We were all surprised by how clear and beautiful the screen was. I’m not exaggerating it. It’s the best in the segment for sure. Coming to the speakers, they’re clear sounding and have good bass. Maybe not as much as the Kushaq because this one doesn’t get a subwoofer (bad move by VW). I don’t mind paying the extra 10-15k. The Taigun speakers are clearer than the ones in the new Safari. The JBL speakers in the Safari are more bass heavy, but the voice is a bit muffled. The Taigun is clearer, but not as bass heavy as the Safari. The seats were solid. Built and stitched better than the Kushaq. The front seats had good support. No complains. I’m 6’2. Coming to the rear seats, this one reminds me of the Baleno. Acres of legroom. I’ve said this before and I’ll say this again, what differentiates a good rear seat to a great one is the foot room and this is where Kushaq/Taigun excel. The front seats are placed on top of this railing which is 2 inches above the floor. This leaves a lot of space to stretch your feet which in turn improves your under thigh support. The Taigun rear seats are very good. It’s great for two people or three lean people. The head room is sufficient for me. I guess I have 2 inches more. Although not everyone is as tall as me. The middle seat has lower headroom because of a protrusion. I’m glad there were no ventilated seats. None of my cars have it and I experienced it on the Kushaq. It feels good, but it’s soo noisy. In the Kushaq, switch off the music and turn on the ventilated seats and it gives out this annoying hissing sound. I’d rather have no ventilated seats than have a bad one. The disappointing part: The damn ROOF LINER . This is the definition of ‘fly in the ointment’. I can’t believe this has passed VW’s QA and QC. It’s just CHEAP. It’s GROSS and has no place in a VW or any car that costs 2 million rupees. Just look at it. It’s disgusting. It’s soo flimsy that it moves up and down with a light tap of your little finger. The doors, the switches and everything inside and outside are built well. However, the front roof is just built horribly. I don’t know why they gave a cutout for a sunglasses holder and decided to keep it closed. Makes no sense. The SA asked me about the car and I was all praises and told him my friend will book one as soon as VW changes the quality of the roof liner. From my post, it’s clear I liked the Taigun very much and it ticks all the right boxes. It’s only the roof liner that pissed me off. Hopefully VW is reading this and gets to work. A note to prospective owners: 1. I would recommend to wait for a couple of months and make sure the Taigun has no EPC issues. I don’t care who and what they say on Twitter, I’ll wait for a couple of months and be on the safe side. I don’t want a local service station opening up my new car. 2. In the Kushaq thread, couple of them complained about the AC. When I test drove the Kushaq, I personally didn’t find the AC to be effective, especially in our summers. Do take a long test drive and check out the AC. Cheers!", 23rd September 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Vizag/Hyd,189,"1,404"

IMHO - Wrong way to look at things because the DSG alone costs around 1.8 lakhs if we go by the pricing of Kushaq, making the GT manual look VFM. See the pricing for the Kushaq to know the premium for the DSG alone. Kushaq 1.5 MT - 16.2 lakhs. Kushaq 1.5 DSG - 18 lakhs. Taigun GT+ DSG - 17.5 lakhs. Taigun GT+ MT - Should have been around 15.7 lakhs 'introductory' had VW decided to bring it instead of the barebones GT manual variant. Doesn't sound so VFM anymore? 70k would have brought tons of kit. I feel 1.5 MT buyers should just look at the Skoda.

Yes, you have to pick the colour carefully to avoid the ugly red trims inside - is it clear if this is an option or if it is forced on you based on the exterior colour?

So, I will prefer petrol. I am terribly confused soul now. Booked a Kushaq, but cancelled it due to lack of 6 airbags. Booked an X-Line Seltos. Loved the looks, feel and build of it. Should be ready for delivery in 2-4 weeks. But I am confused due to the weak NCAP rating. I plan to book an XUV700 and get that ""buy Indian"" thrill. I'm not sure about the delivery timelines though. No Aster as I say no to Chinese. I had booked Taigun GT+. They promised to deliver by Mid/End October. Had a look at the car today in their showroom. My feedback - 1. Digital cockpit (so called) & infotainment console placement looks better. Overall feel of the interior is good. The Kushaq was equally good. Nowhere close to the X-Line Seltos though. 2. Exterior is equally good, but nowhere close to the X-Line Seltos. 4. Seat quality is cheap. No ventilated seats in the GT+. 5. AC vents quality is worse than an Alto. Roof quality is worse than Mumbai's Fiat taxi. 6. I'm yet to get to drive the Taigun. The drive of the Kushaq was superb. In fact, the suspension of the Kushaq was also very impressive. The drive and suspension of the Seltos was also good, but nowhere close to Germans. 7. The music system of the Seltos was the best. The Kushaq's top variant with woofer was also very very good. The Taigun GT+ is without a woofer, but still it's okay. 8. Looked at the Taigun's sunroof with the shade opened. All its components were exposed and it looked ugly. Not a VW. Both these German products lack sincerity and they lack long term purpose. How did those AC vents pass German quality standards? And they are asking Rs. 17.5L for this product? No 360 degree camera, cost-cutting visible everywhere - looks like the Germans are more confused than me. Product wise, you can't beat the Koreans and their resale value in the second hand market demonstrates the same. Koreans cheat on what's not visible and can't be felt (safety).

Now? In a crowded market - Creta, Seltos, Astor coming up, Breeza, the Hector, Harrier, upcoming XUV 700 (though the later 3 are just above the Kushaq / Creta category), it needed a compelling value proposition if Vision MQB IN was going to move volumes.

I dont like pressing the clutch in dense Bangalore traffic. Sometimes it hurts quite a lot despite my car has one of the smoothest and soft clutch. Advantage of AT 1. Easy to drive around the city. 2. Your left leg will thank you. 3. Unlike the 1.5 DSG, 1.0 has Aisin (Toyota) gearbox and are reliable. 4. Most people opted for automatic (except AMT gearbox variants), dont want to go for manual for their next car. Disadvantages of AT 1. They are slightly thirsty compared to manual. 2. AT in general is slightly complex compared to MT and not many have expertise outside the authorised service centre. 3. Hardcore enthusiast will not like AT except maybe ZF or DSG gearboxes. I dont recommend 1.5 DSG. The transmission on the 1.5 is bound to fail in our traffic conditions. They are also very expensive.

As it was relatively empty got some time to see the cars closely. Most of the points are already covered by all folks. I will try to add my 2 cents which could have been done better. Red, silver & yellow color was on display. Red is a good pick. Tyres: Goodyear Tyre profile on GT+ (205/55/R17) will fetch lower value in case of upgrade straight out of showroom. Reason: No other company apart from Pirelli has availability in India for stock to stock change. I would definitely recommend an upgrade to better rubber. Chrome: Volkswagen has overdone chrome. It's not in their DNA. Dechrome option is required. Owner Manual: Yes it is same for Taigun & Tcross. It is a small thin booklet 147 pages in total. Sunvisor: This is not extendable. Which is a bummer in my opinion for a car at this price. What happen to practicality? Lights & switches These look ancient and qualify for lowest benchmark across in the segment and below. Tactile feel of switches is very shoddy. Plastic: Hard plastics every where. Expected as TROC has the same. Next generation TROC will see generational shift in interior. No offence AC vents looks and feel cheap. Subjective color combination: Silver GT+ with red color insert interiors didn't gel. There is no cohesiveness. I just don't get it.

672, Drivethru , 14:28 ,BHPian,"Visited VW Nerul yesterday to have a look at Taigun The vehicle looks larger than its physical dimensions in the Curcuma Yellow colour. There were not too many prospective customers in the showroom. They had a test car ready. Test car was fully loaded GT DSG model in the Curcuma Yellow colour. They had 3 more display cars parked outside. Taigun looks understated in Candy white colour. Compared to the Kushaq, the front fascia looks more protruding and i would say slightly aggressive (looks are subjective) Doors are lighter than the normal weight expected from VW cars. Till 4000 rpm cabin noise was less in stationary mode. (there is no cladding / thick cloth covering in the bonnet inside part which is glaring miss ). Taigun digested undulated roads, potholes and sharp corners well. The pick up is linear and decent. The power delivery reminds me of the Fabia petrol (Taigun has better technology) which I first drove in 2007/08. I should say the showroom sales person who attended to me was better trained than the Kia showroom next to the VW showroom. Sales guy knows he is speaking to a potential customer of a car with a 20+ lakhs on road price. My final opinion on the car good to drive, slightly pricey for what it offers.

673, MegaWhat , 14:44 ,BHPian,"Saw the car in the flesh today and took a TD of both 1.0L AT and 1.5L AT. Loved the way it drives, especially the 1.5L AT. Both seemed to handle the small potholes quite well but I felt as if the 1.0L did it better. Maybe it's the lower kerb weight or maybe I simply imagined it. Not sure. A few other points: The turning radius is ~5.2m as opposed to 5.05m as mentioned in the initial brochure. The highline variant seems really stripped off of many creature comforts. It seems as if it has been placed in the lineup simply to nudge customers towards the topline. BU Bhandari, Pune seems to be giving a 10k loyalty discount for existing VW customers who buy the Taigun. The NVH levels are fairly the same between the 1.0L and 1.5L inside the cabin despite the 1.0 being a 3 cylinder engine. The interior plastics have been commented upon a lot. The only point I would add is that if you do apply a sticker to the coloured part of the dashboard and then decide to remove it for any reason, the plastic retains a LOT of the adhesive residue. A lot more than say the plastic in the Polo. A good cleaning session would be needed to remove this residue. I observed this as the vehicles had some sort of a sticker that was then removed before being displayed in the showroom or being used for a TD. I found the rear seats quite comfortable. I am 5'11 and had set the front seat as per my driving position. The only quirk is that to get into the rear, you need to take a good step over the edge of the door frame. The floor of the rear seat is quite low as compared to the doorframe. It's almost like stepping over a log of wood while hiking. It's not a deal breaker for me, but just something that I need to keep in mind considering some old folks that I may have as passengers. It's something I observed with the Compass as well. The SA says the fuel pump issues observed in the Kushaq have been addressed in the Taigun. For the digital cockpit, the warning at 80kmph approximately covers the top half of the speedometer. So when you get the ping and if you try to look at the speed via the speedometer, you cant. The warning blocks it. You need to rely on the digital display of the speed value to the right side of the cluster. ", 27th September 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Pune/Oxford,99,631

Not entirely true. Taigun is basically a T-Cross, which internationally is placed as starting variant below TROC. Area could have been cleverly masked. Skoda has done in Kamiq and skipped in Kushaq.

The rear seat felt decent and has decent under thigh support as well as leg space, which I felt much better than T-Roc, which has poor under thigh support and legroom and Taigun was close to Creta/Seltos in terms of rear seat legroom and underthigh support. Comparison of rear leg space between Taigun, T-Roc and Seltos. First pic is Taigun while second one is Seltos and third one is T-Roc I wanted to TD this car in 1.0 TSI AT guise but dealer told me to come later as the TD vehicle went out it seems and TD vehicles of 1.5 TSI DSG will be available in few days as per the SA. Will TD both soon when I go that side again and post the impressions post TD. Overall, Taigun felt decent in terms of rear seat legroom and under thigh support as well as build but Ill stretch the budget and go for T-Roc just for its build quality though both has same 1.5 EVO TSI engine. But, in Taigun, my pick would be 1.0 TSI AT as itll suffice our strict city usage as DSG is known for its issues though more powerful when compared to 1.0 TSI AT.", 30th September 2021,volkswagen-taigun,HYD/FMT/SEA,635,"1,218"

Have been looking for the car for 2 years (my 9 year old Ritz was ageing, Ritz will surely achieve Nirvana with its right Karma/ ownership experience ). Wanted a car larger than a hatchback and smaller than a SUV. Started with Jazz/ Venue/ Sonnet/ Seltos/ TROC/ Kushaq and finally decided on Taigun. Test drove TROC earlier this year and zeroed on 1.5-DSG combination. Waited for Kushaq, lack of 6 airbags killed the deal, pre-booked the Taigun. Launching Taigun at 17.49 and test drive last week sealed the deal. Initial observations It has a Auto Engine on off - When the car halts temporarily at traffic signals, the engine switches off (rest all AC/Music system remains on though), and it switches back once we release the foot off the brake or move the steering. Assuming there is risk of start-stop mechanism wearing off due to frequent usage turned the feature off. Read about this last night and learnt that it is perfectly ok to keep it on, engine parts are not compromised with this feature. Will be good to get a geeky feedback on how to optimize use of this feature. Now eagerly looking forward to upcoming road trips ", 1st October 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Mumbai,84,328

I felt the horn in this one awful and sounded like Toyota. Missing that VW feel. That steering is good to hold though The traction control is located on the HU screen And the car I drove was Highline version, which misses out on bling like sunroof, 17 inch wheels, push button start and others As I mentioned in the above post, the build quality is decent and can feel heaviness from the doors but not as good as Vento and T-Roc and the sheet thickness of Taigun is 0.6 while Polos is 0.8 as per my SA. Is it true? Experts please confirm about this. Overall, I felt the 1.0 TSI AT good to drive and itll be my pick if the car is driven within the city limits most of the time and its suitable for the people, who doesnt care much about the performance. But, still Id go for Vento TSI as Im getting a handsome discount of ₹1.7L or Id save the money and get Polo GT TSI.

709, yeggina , 17:09 ,BHPian,"Attaching the Price List from PPS Motors Hyderabad. Do notice the very high Delivery charges(Logistics). As it is, VW got their pricing wrong, now the dealers too are milking the customers. Any idea if VW Mody in Hyderabad, has similar Delivery charges? Also wanted to understand what people feel about the Taiguns pricing and branding strategy. IMO, somebody should be losing their job for their dismal strategy (if gaining marketshare in India was their goal). 1. Skoda and VW have priced Kushaq and Taigun a lakh too high, across the board. This despite localisation. 2. They forgot that their SUV? has two buyer groups. The 10-15 lakhs buyer who is price-sensitive and expects Value For Money and the 15-20 lakhs buyer who wants the cake and the icing too at that cost. These guys have not satisfied either groups. In fact, they have made a mess of the 10-15 lakhs customer group as that is is the group that would have got them the volumes. 3. And which astute gentleman decided to put those ugly chrome lives on Taiguns bumpers. Did VW think that is what would get them the Hyundai and Kia customers running to them while forgetting and skimping on so many other features besides getting the variant feature mixes wrong. Frankly, I found the VW Brand Directors interviews in the past few weeks rather smug and this is reflected in the pricing, features and launch. But am keenly following if it works for VW and Skoda, then it can be replicated at so many levels and in multiple verticals. The product seems to be a decent product but not a runaway winner especially with no diesel option and it would be interesting to see how the market responds over a year.", 1st October 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Hyderabad,53,6

714, amithsebastian , 17:50 ,BHPian,"Hi Guys, Need your help to decide. Wanted to upgrade my Polo GT TSI. So was awaiting the Taigun and have booked the top end GT+ version. Though we liked the drive dynamics, features are also good enough, but the interior was a huge let down ! The car doesnt feel like a 20L + car inside. Considering we would be spending most of our time driving it! I have a Tiguan 2L TDI and love it and i was hoping Taigun to be a mini version of it and perfect for my wife to upgrade the Polo GT to a Taigun GT ! On some recommendations, I did go and see the MG Astor today and was really impressed with it. I did like both the Astor and the EV. I know EV is opening a new dimension altogether ! Thoroughly confused now on if I should scrap the Taigun and consider an MG Astor/EV. Also the fuel pump issues on the Kushaq is not comforting even though VW states its a known issue and has sorted it.. am told that replaced fuel pumps in Kushaq has got issues even now. TRoc am told is not in stock and the last selling price is around 32L , so thats not making sense either. Any other options I should explore ?

PPS can always get stock from other state dealers. MG Astor is a good value proposition on paper. I say on paper due to fact that I haven’t had a chance to test drive. Purely based on showroom experience it is a great value proposition. What are your expectations? Are you willing to compromise on driving dynamics? Is quick shifting gear box one of your basic requirements? What is the primary usage of this vehicle? Will it be restricted to city runs? Any preference of CBU?

716, amithsebastian , 19:24 ,BHPian,"Thanks @circleoflife. Yes the confusion was bothering me and I just got off call with multiple dealers and managed to find a Troc and they are offering it at 27L. One of the last cars in their stock! I think I am inclined towards the Troc Vs Astor with the VW build and drive dynamics. It has pretty much all the features I want. ( better plastics , Vienna leather seats, panoramic sunroof, realistic virtual cockpit (compared to Taigun) and the possibility of adding the other features from international models ( like I have done for my Tiguan ) Astor has an amazing list of features which is great, but MG am unsure on the reliability and build and it will surely be there in the back of mind. I test drove it; the features are great but drive quality is not comparable to VW. Quote: Originally Posted by CircleOfLife 32lakhs? Dealer is fleecing you.

717, Newtown , 00:11 ,BHPian,"Folks - I am pleased to share with all of you that my Taigun GT+ in curcuma yellow arrived yesterday. I'd like to share a few things after about 250 kms driven so far: The DSG on the Taigun is better mannered when I compare it to the earlier tuning of the same DQ200 on the Polo and Vento. It feels very well planted on the road and has excellent road manners. Just a beauty to drive. The 1.5 TSI with the DSG is like a sleeper and will just fly if you want it to. I am running the car in so exercising a lot of restraint right now. Yes I am aware a run in is not needed but I do this to all my cars and they have served me well. So I will continue to do this. I liked the VW connect app that rates your driving and tells you about the number of times you did hard braking, Hard acceleration, Over-speeding. The telemetrics also gives very detailed (to the second) route information. Also shows real time digital cockpit parameters. Not too fancy an app, but has what I in my opinion is needed. The sun roof opening is larger than other cars that have a non panoramic sunroof. It provides a much larger viewing area on top despite there being no panoramic roof. I thought that was nice. Was comparing this to City 4th gen. The plastics used may be lighter in nature but by no means are they flimsy. I was not worried on 'using' them as they are supposed to be rather than baby them to last. On this count I found the Kushaq's plastics somewhat lacking.

Doesnt work, does it? Combine that with the ever demanding client.

So I decided to take the DSG for a spin, few observations from my experience of the car: 1. Exterior paint quality shouts perfect VAG and panel gaps are uniform as expected. 2. Interior is well put together except the roof liner, even my Polo has it better. 3. Rear bucket seating is very comfortable and best suited for 4 adults and a kid. 4. Infotainment system is very responsive and crisp, I did not find any lag but audio output could be better. 5. Digital cockpit though looked not so well in pictures, in person it looks something one can live with and good (TROC one looks much better). 6. The red ambient lighting reminds you of the more powerful heart under the hood. 7. Bonnet, Boot and Front doors have good amount of heft, the flex being reported in the fenders is more to do with safety norms. In short, car no way felt like it has been compromised on safety to make it cost effective (which it isn't). The DRIVE: 1. The 1.5 TSI is very addictive TBH, I saw in reviews that people feel that it was tuned to perform in a linear way but atleast I found the engine to be very responsive and torquey. 2. DSG though is infamous still seems the best the competition has to offer, the smooth and lighting fast shifts are a driver delight. 3. Ride and handling balance as everyone has reported seems the best in its class, I did find the steering to be lighter than my Polo but in general it is precise and better than Koreans. I came back pretty impressed and would wait for VW to launch the manual variant of the GT+ and then proceed with my booking.

749, tj112 , 20:05 ,Newbie,"Test drove the Kushaq 1.5 AT & the Taigun 1.5 AT back to back today. Had driven the Astor 1.3 Turbo a couple of days back. Sharing some of my observations - The ride quality/ suspension of the Kushaq seemed much more comfortable. While driving the Taigun over bumps/ rumble strips & small breakers, could feel the vibrations in a much more pronounced way. On mentioning the same to the VW Sales advisor seated next to me, he said that is how it is with VW, ie a stiffer ride. I found it a bit too stiff esp in comparison to the Kushaq. I somehow found the Turbo lag in the Taigun to be more pronounced, while the Kushaq seemed to offer more linear power. Having driven the Astor 1.3 turbo a couple of days, i found both the Kushaq & Taigun to be significantly superior in terms of the power, responsiveness & super fun to drive. The Taigun definitely scores above the Kushaq in terms of the interiors, the digital instrument cluster & the overall finishing. Astor being much better than the other 2 though. Kushaq's ventilated seats are a big plus in the heat. Though the continuous hissing of the air was a slight irritant. Kushaq seemed to have a much better music system Vs the Taigun. Taigun seemed to offer really very basic audio output. The 2 cylinders switching off while having stopped on traffic lights was clearly perceptible & seemed as of the car had shut down. Though on slight push of the accelerator they were back up. Similar on both the cars, but clearly perceptible in terms of vibrations & slightly disquieting to me. Not commenting on the boot space & rear seat comfort, as they are not of significance to me. Taigun's ugly yellow was a turn off, they did not have a Grey, which is what i feel will look the best Kushaq's stance makes it look the closest to the ground with a lesser presence as compared to both Taigun & Astor Except Astor, the other 2 cars though do not come across as 20L cars, esp from the interiors/ hard plastics. For me they are in the consideration set only because of the good engine & lack of options in Sedans in the 15-20L range. Due to the limited supply of cars (chip issues), both Skoda & VW are able to present a decent face, however in normal circumstances, their managements would have been under huge pressure, if there was no supply constraint. Am hoping for the discounts to increase on Kushaq (30-50K currently) & start on Taigun in the next 2-3 months & will probably book at that time. As per the sales assistants, both Kushaq & Taigun are available for delivery in 7-20 days depending on the color.", 12th October 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Delhi,24,36

756, darthvader5000 , 22:01 ,BHPian,"Visited a VW showroom to test drive the 1 lit MT Topline (was'nt interested in the AT). Need to let go of my Ford Fusion 1.6 petrol ( which simply still rocks) since it finishes 15 years early next year. Having also been a proud Polo TDi owner for 8 years now, first thing was to open and shut the driver side door to listen for the 'thump'. I felt, there was a noticeable lack of the same. I then rapped against the metal door and it did feel not as solid as my existing Polo. Insides. The plastic is overt and very Maruti like and i quite didnt like that. Sound, not a fan of it any more ( apart from subtle music or oldies) so was nt very observant, but seemed ok to me for my hearing pleasure. A few raps here and there on the dashboard seemed like a wee bit below the Polo again in terms of solidity. AC vents seemed std fits from Polo to here. The aircon panel again, glare in its finish and seemed rather tacky. Infotainment panel, did not bother much, but was concerned about google maps, which i was told, the inbuilt apps pairs to one's mobile and pairs the google map screen from the phone to the display. That seemed acceptable, though it would drain my phone battery. 02 charging points just below the aircon panel, micro usb. So iphone users need to get a cable and also check the outputs of the micro usb ( has anyone checked that or is it a std, am sorry am not aware ) The Drive. Pert engine. Turbo kicks in at around 60 kmph and the car leaps, though not as much as a TDi does.That said, from a red light , acceleration, manual shift ups were a breeze and smooth. Engine sound throaty. I could'nt make out it's 3 pot or a 4 pot and frankly i could'nt care since it behaved superbly (just saying) since it's mostly going to do city drives with maybe a couple of long drives (600 km plus) on vacations to the mountains twice a year. When driving fast, i normally downshift whilst slowing to enable better handling and control) and the car felt totally so whilst still raring to go when throttled. The suspension seemed fine else id have noticed some thing amiss. The drive was on a metaled road on a fri afternoon with traffic and then some spaces with open roads. I personally like the hand rest both front and rear. Rear space legroom seemed bigger than the Seltos. My Beagle lover to panker all over so that is important to me ( he goes with us on all vacations) I am personally a fan of VW and prefer them to all else in this and lower segments since the safety, cost of ownership and solid feel on any expressway at all speeds is something one cannot put a value on. And VW once sold, the dealership does not want to see your face for the next 12 months ( unless you have a problem). First service is about 9k plus. But, most other brands ( i dont know about Kia and MG) want the mandatory 1k, 6 monthly and 12 monthly servicing ( your warranty is void otherwise) which costs more than an annual VW service. Please correct me here if it's not. That being said. I just read the Astor review today. Sounds better VFM. Dont know about the build quality and cost of ownership. If someone could advise. But personally, i dont trust 'chini' products and i have this thing about them going down the GM way down the line. Notwithstanding that, would appreciate comments in favour of the Astor. Pricing. I think,VW has reduced features in the AT simply to keep pricing under control. Sunroof is a friggin waste in India, unless one drives only in the mountains given our pollution and noise levels in the city. Exit of hot air when aircon is switched on is pretty much not worth the cost. The wife (drives the Polo to work ) does nt care for too much for ventilated seats since the aircon does a good job. Between LEDs with DRLs on a AT v/s Halogens on the same model MT, not sure if its really matters. Personally i find LEDs bad since most Indians drive on high beam whether in the city or on the highway (and i dont know why the RTOs dont ever challan and teach people/ put hoardings on this) and they can really blind the opposite lane driver. Last is digital display on the AT v/s the std on the MT. Individual choice. Nice to have, but would'nt miss it. 6 airbags should have been std on all , but again a pricing issue i guess So given the above I am, being a loyal VW owner again tempted to go for the 1 lit MT ( Highline or Topline) is my reason for posting here. Also anything favouring the Astor or any other brand for that matter. Not a M&M fan since my mechanic for the last 29 odd years gives me inputs on these, similarly Skoda is a no.

Since you already have a strong preference for VW, my suggestion would be to just go ahead with them. However good other brands may seem in some areas, I feel you will miss the VW driving dynamics and this will always come and bite you every time you drive it enthusiastically (This is nothing persons, most of us tend to remember negatives much more than positives) Whether you want to go with Taigun now, or wait out for 6/12 months to get niggles sorted out, or want to consider alternatives like upcoming sedan or TROC is your choice based on your budget, time constraints and body style preference.", 17th October 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,43,121
758, vinitbarve , 19:53 ,BHPian,"Here goes my Taigun's first long trip review on the Dasara weekend Car: Taigun 1.5 DSG GT Drive: Mumbai-Wai-Satara- Pune- Mumbai, about 550 KMs Attached summary of my trip The drive was smooth, acceleration was linear. Turbo lag was noticable but very subtle (unlike venue/ Sonet turbo, where the lag felt much more prominent). The best part of the drive was the power, the car begs to be driven fast. Overtaking/ accelerating at 120-130kmph felt easy. D mode was at times found lacking in power while overtaking/ need for sudden acceleration. But the S mode would bring that delight with a butter smooth acceleration. I drove in D mode for 95% of the trip, used S mode for faster accelerations/ overtaking or brakings before toll/ signals. Used Manual mode at the toll queues, drove in M1 and to move to higher gears and optimize fuel efficiency, where I drove to M7, while mechatronix went for D6. Will be good to hear joshmachine's feedback if this qualifies right usage of modes on the DSG Seat cushion was exceptionally good. Cushion at the hamstrings as well as the back was comforting. My friend who just bought a Safari too agreed that the seat design was better than Safari and felt really comfortable. We have our driver seat closer to the steering. With the 2 dimensional steering adjustment, digital display visibility could be adjusted. Didnt notice any blind spots during the drive. I was not a fan of the sun roof, and having a car sunroof was incidental than a choice. But drive in the evening felt nice and more spacious with a Sunroof. Digital display is adequate. I was initially disappointed, but now getting used to the functions. Left side top displays ""Auto On Off Mode"". I keep this mode on in the city, off on highways. Dont want the engine to turn on/off on toll queues, dont mind the engine turning off on the traffic signals. Right side bottom, displays the cruise control statuses. Will put up a separate post explaining left side controls on the steering and Cruise control mode. One con, that Newtown/ Neville pointed out, the total car KMs are not displayed when the cruise control is activated. Luggage space is large and more than what we need, dont have a comparison benchmark here. Screen clarity and size is very good, still getting used to the functionality Cons - 1. My maruti's widest part was the bumper, hence that was the impact area for any of the scratches. Taigun's widest part is its door lining, scratched there are likely to be more prominent and expensive to clean. 2. There is a scope for the sunroof to remain partially open; without the anyone noticing it. So do ensure if it is properly closed. 3. I didnt like the one touch AC System. The buttons were sensitive and an inadvertent touch would result in change in AC settings. 4. There are times when I miss the front view camera, especially till I get a full sense of the car dimensions. 5. I like the old age Keyed cars, where the key had a designated slot to store it. Not unusual for both of us to be searching for the key. Worst part of the drive, Wife refused to vacate the driver's seat, she drove as much as I did during the trip (on my old car the ratio was 75/ 25 in my favour). Looks like I will have part away more with my driving time. Now the fuel efficiency part... About 70% on Highways; 20% in cities (includes bad toll queue at Navi Mumbai, Moderate/Low queues on other roads; 10% on interior roads mix of kuccha roads and asphalt 2 lane roads. Trip average of ~15 KMPL Peak average ~23.5 KMPL, on Pune Vashi strectch (it involves a downhill) Eco - mode display appears at the right bottom next to the fuel remaining symbol as ""eco"" Eco Mode was up for short spans, seldom exceeded 1 min. Any acceleration or braking or change of gears led to disabling the Eco mode. one hardly feels any change in driving when the mode is on. My return trip fuel efficiency was 19.3, Pune to Dadar drive involves down hill from Lonavala to Khalapur, hence higher efficiency, but got compensated due to long queue at the Vashi toll bridge", 17th October 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Mumbai,84,328

You have mentioned that you switched to ""S"" mode while braking before toll/signals. In my view, there is no particular need to switch to S for braking in general. The S mode typically tends to hold on to those gears for bit longer as compared to the D mode, but that shouldn't be clubbed with braking in general. You can continue to use the D mode and apply brakes before approaching toll booth/signals. The use of Manual mode is rather more efficient for engine braking or for slow-speed/crawling traffic, as you have rightly done. As and when you want to increase the speed with clear roads ahead, it might be ergonomically better to switch back to D or S modes and let the gearbox decide the best speed for you instead of manually changing to higher gears such as M6 or M7.

763, kaustubhp , 15:23 ,BHPian,"I don't know if I am late to the party but here is a spec comparison I did for myself. I am in the market for a AT car for about 18L on road in Gurgaon. The options are Taigun 1L Topline (and all segments below), Kushaq 1L Style AT, Creta SX IVT and Seltos HTX IVT. All petrol models since NCR has a 10 year rule. Not that I intend to keep the car for that long but resale drops when your car has only 2-3 years left before the RC goes for renewal. My choice was Taigun 1L Topline AT for reasons below: 1. None of the other cars offer 6 air bags. 2. Cosmetic feature wise also, all cars get Electric Sunroof but Seltos does not get wireless charging. Creta does not wireless android auto apple car play. Taigun and Kushaq get both. Case in point, Taigun gets all. 3. Creta loses out on telescoping steering which all three get. 4. Both VAGs do not get air purifier which Koreans get. It is a miss but I would weight wireless Android Auto and Apple Car Play over that. 5. Yes, Taigun & Kushaq have not been crash tested but Seltos has it does not inspire confidence. I would be very surprised if Taigun Kushaq scored the same as Seltos but even then, some advanced safety features of multi-collision breaking, brake assist are definitely an advantage in the VAGs. 6. Another safety feature according to me is auto dimming IRVM, which also the Creta loses out on. All three have those. 7. The window switches do not have background light in Koreans (Creta def.), but the VAGs have. Some advantages of the Koreans 1. I prefer the linear acceleration of CVT/IVTs over ATs with TSI engines so the Koreans score well here for me. 2. Re-sale. Koreans should sell well by a mile. Seltos' after sales figure are promising. 3. ASS. Hyundai has 6 dealers in my vicinity in Gurgaon. Kia has 2. Skoda & VW, 2 each. 4. Service cost. It is a given I guess.

Gupta stated that VW dealerships are receiving about 250 bookings per day on average and that the Taigun's planned production volumes for 2021 are now sold out. He added that VW could temporarily halt bookings if the momentum continues. I truly wonder if this true, I visited VW showroom few times in the recent past and I did not even see 25 people checking out Taigun, let alone book one. Since my elite i20 was sold at a good price, I had to let it go and I thought booking a Taigun might get me a car early, in spite all the fears popping up in my head, I went ahead and did the booking by paying 25k, the manager then said he can give me grey Color 1.0 Topline AT by end of October if I am ready with the payment. I discussed at home and all wanted the Colour to be red, so had to let it go. They also had a yellow Colour 1.5 GT plus readily available. When I made the booking they told me they will provide the receipt next morning and also the booking number. Manager assured me that he will try to see if they can get the red colour by middle of November. I came home and there were still thoughts looming in my head about the reliability and trouble free ownership (spoiled by swift and i20). When I went to bed at night I just couldnt sleep thinking about all the negative things that can come to mind about owning a VW then to calm my mind I finally decided, if I dont get a positive vibe by tomorrow I will cancel the booking. After waking up in morning I sent a Whats app message to SA asking him to share the receipt and booking number and as expected he didnt send anything until I finally cancelled the booking. I made him 3 calls in that day and every time he said sir will send you details in half hour. To add fuel to the fire, cancellation was also based on following reasons. They insisted me to buy insurance from them, they quoted approximately 88k (0 dep) and I got a quote of 35k (comprehensive)from ACKO. The insurance was staggering 53k expensive. They told me it is compulsory to buy the essentials accessories kit costing 10.5k They were consistently pushing me to buy the SVP maintenance pack and Extended Warranty pack right at time of vehicle purchase by instilling fear of price increase. Unprofessional behaviour by sales staff and casual/ overconfident attitude of manager( sir ek bar jo VW leta hai woh aur koi gadi nahi leta). When I cancelled the booking I also realised that they do not even have a fixed process on what is required for cancellation. Manager told me to provide a physical request letter for cancellation and it will take 15 days for them to issue a cheque. When I enquired same thing with the SA, he told me to send a cancellation request on whats app and they will issue a cheque within 4 to 5 days. I have worked with German people / german company for almost 12 years and one thing I learned from them was strong documentation and process oriented approach. This VW dealer is complete opposite of that. I prepared a cancellation request letter, took two prints of it attached the google pay receipt, went to showroom and gave them one copy and took a received signature on another copy for myself. The SA told, sir I will personally call you and give you the cheque within 4 to 5 days. I dont expect him to call me back even after a year . Sorry for such a long post but I feel bad for VW, they make good products but are let down by such dealers . I even thought I will ignore the sales people and go ahead with purchase but then the thought came to my mind, that I will have to deal with same dealership for all the future maintenance & services and the city I belong to is not a tier I city, hence we do not have many other options for VW servicing and FNGs.", 28th October 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Aurangabad,47,222

Isn't the same strategy opted by MG but they did it better way, as it was more centralized way of making the booking and visibility to customers. VW Dealers might have ordered extra stock on hand and also cancellation would have effected inventory availability at dealer but from VW stand point they have dusted their hands off. VW might not accept further orders from dealers with commitment of 2021 deliveries but dealers might have stock to move around. December being a lean month of manufacturing as most of the stock production with 2022 VIN will happen around this time so effectively there is just 1 more month of manufacturing left. Here is a good marketing call out. As a group my hunch is VW certainly has not much visibility on dealer stock, a good example was VRS and Tiguan All Space. In both the cases organization struggled to locate inventory at dealers. Frequent flip flops. There was demand in certain pockets of country and they just couldn't move the stock around effectively.

Although slightly pricey, the Taigun offers an incredible package in my view - driving pleasure, safety and fantastic looks. The size is just right for someone who wants to use it within the city as well as for long distance journeys. The interiors are slightly better than the Kushaq and the service network is much wider. I do expect that the Taigun will take the lion share of volumes going forward, between the two twins as the rollout continues. It looks more premium inside and out as compared to the Kushaq for approximately the same price point. Now, I just wish they would provide 6 airbags as standard equipment across variants, to take the pole position in safety and make a bold and clear statement in the market.

Most of Taigun deliveries have been recent and stray issues might crop up later. Its a good sign none have been reported till or or could be a case where it hasnt caught the limelight. Taigun is flashy vs understated looks of Kushaq and to an extent the color combination feels appropriate giving that roomy feeling. Interior dashboard is better in Kushaq. That tail lamp in Taigun looks smashing in the night. One can spot it from a long distance. You are right skoda has to catch the network spread of the big brother Volkswagen. For example entire TS & AP has only 1 dealer for 20 years. This is the only 1 reason I never opted for skoda. Now with expansion strategy there will be 3 dealers and additional 2 already own & run VW outlets. This gives a certain confidence that if things go south at anyone dealerships or service center one has a fall back plan. VW and notorious silent updates will address these air bags in future iterations. To an extent govt policy will also be a impetus. Where cost & positioning is a factor, there will be certain differentiation. Octavia which is nearly 30 lakhs on road L&K gets 8 airbags VS 6 Airbags in Style variant.This will be one factor that drives folks to consider higher variants. If lower variant covers all safety requirements why will majority folks opt for higher variants. Lower variant also dont have enough profit margins.

Volkswagen has received over 18,000 bookings for the Taigun since its launch. In October 2021, the carmaker registered close to 50% growth in overall sales volumes compared to the same month last year. The Taigun is based on the MQB A0-IN platform that is shared with Skoda Kushaq. Prices range from Rs. 10.50 lakh to Rs. 17.50 (ex-showroom) for the GT Line Plus trim It is available with two turbo-petrol engine options. These include a 1.0-litre TSI that makes 113 BHP and 178 Nm as well as a 1.5-litre TSI that puts out 148 BHP and 250 Nm. The 1.0L engine comes with a 6-speed automatic transmission while the latter gets a 7-speed DSG option. A 6-speed manual gearbox is available as standard with both engines.

820, cloudno19 , 11:12 ,BHPian,"Writing a TEAMBHP post after a good 2-3month break. I got myself a T-Roc in Sep 2021 (more out of desperation post agonizingly waiting for Tiguan to launch). More on this in T-Roc thread (coming soon). Recently, was at service center here in Pune for first month service of T-ROC which has an adjacent showroom from where I had picked up my car. I wanted to checkout Taigun but it was morning 10-10:30am and the showroom was yet not open and I couldn't find any staff, but only the maintenance team wiping the floors. I asked the maintenance team if he was ok for me to checkout Taigun displayed in showroom, and he gladly welcomed me. Coming to my view of spending 10 mins touching and feeling Taigun- GT 1.5 DSG- Looked liked a mini Tiguan and was almost similar in dimension to my T-ROC maybe slightly less width (this maybe just my perception, I do not have actual dimension information). Touched and opened the front door and it felt heavy almost like my T-ROC may be slightly lighter but had the thud. I was confused why the people were questioning about built quality? It didn't seemed bad to me especially when compared to Honda City or a Hyundai Creta (no offense to respective owners, just my observation). Next I did the same thing with Rear door and I was hit by reality and my confusion was answered. In comparison to front driver side door, the rear door felt like being built using a single sheet of metal, an I was shocked VW could do that to us. I opened the rear boot, and found it built exactly similar to the rear door. I struggle lifting the rear boot lid of my T-Roc, just because of the weight and this felt flimsy. Interior linings and plastics felt cheap simply lacked any premium feeling that Ashish Gupta has been shouting over the roof. To summarize, I felt VW are simply down to cheating the Indian consumers, especially their niche customer base who look at VW for their strong built quality, fit and finish and driving dynamics, with these cheap made in India product. I see them confused about their own strategy on what they really want to achieve- Talk about offering Premium Product at premium pricing by offering a substandard product that I am sure is not even built this way for global market. I don't think any of their products world wide would be carrying such non-sense quality not even Polo in India or Up globally. Someone needs to beat the sense out of the management who ended up with such product development decision. Somehow, I have started feeling that investing in VW T-ROC by paying much higher premium seems all worth it as it definitely seems like a much much better built car in all expects and truly a global product. Avoid this product, it's not worth it and to me it's not a true VW product that I am fan of.", 3rd November 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Pune,68,159

Either the management has done a fantastic job or this still has perceived valued among the buyers. Which customer buys the car without seeing? So if you it's cheating then it's exaggerated reaction. Same model will be exported to select countries. I don't think Germans here are ever confused on the strategy part. They will milk the product as long they can. It's not all that bad as pointed out also do consider TCO of Tiagun vs TROC over 5 years. Hard plastics are same between TROC and Taigun. Back space Taigun hold a edge over TROC. Both get the same engine. Difference in sheet metal is evident but unless one has very domain specific experience we are just speculating on if this impacts the safety aspect of the vehicle. This vehicle will also see a incremental upgrade and address the issues in interiors. Volkswagen has always done the same. Infact if you haven't seen the Polo or Vento from the initial launch to the current gent in market you will notice difference here also.

Just offering a 6 airbag variant would have been so welcome, if not the full fledged Topline there or even some select features. I understand they did that to keep the 1.5 MT affordable. But it's a pity that those who want the excellent 1.5 TSI need to either take chances with the DSG transmission or put up with the modestly featured MT at nearly Rs.20 lacs OTR. Also, anyone knows of any VW plans to fix the interiors quality concerns in subsequent batches?

834, tanmay2612 , 19:52 ,Newbie,"Hello All This is my first post since joining. Would like to share my experience so far with Taigun 1.0L MT topline. Booked it during pre-booking and received delivery at date of choice (2nd November) Upgraded from Polo 1.2L highline (Feb-2015). Images for both below. Initial impressions from one week of ownership: 1. Build quality is good but still it leaves a room for improvement and VW can take up improving certain alignments and interior fabrics and plastic to meet their classical standards. 2. Drive and comfort are sorted, body roll is non-existent (especially at restrained driving for run-in period). 3. Steering is light but responsive, both me and my wife liked polos steering and found this light but still precise. 4. Clutch travel is still longer but it needs lesser force and more manageable. 5. Bumps are felt lesser than earlier polo but still road feedback is present in appropriate quantity at front seats. 6. Seats are more than adequate for 4 adults and 1 child (travelled 150Km over Diwali) and didn't find single challenge in accomodating all individuals seated in any position. Can travel for short drives for a single day with 5 adults without much difficulty. Once a while long drive also would not be a challenge. 7. Using it for grocery runs is not tedious, gets in and out of praking as easily as a hatchback. 8. Rearview camera gives enough vision to cover incoming traffic from sides as well. 9. Seat cooling although a feature I was not too keen on having is a boon when coming from direct sunlight in afternoon. 10. Sunroof serves the only purpose of getting it, to keep kids entertained 11. Virtual Information cluster provides enough information and sometimes can be distracting (at least initially) 12. VW connect app seems to have issue as Jio dongle is not online since 3rd November, got to know from my SA it's a server issue. Not sure about it though. 13. Tire pressure warning system works as expected and provides alert on excessive pressure drops. 14. Still trying to connect my Android Auto but need to get correct cable first. 15. Sygic maps works like a breeze, has updated information in offline mode and helps to navigate in both 2D and 3D views. Over-all liked the drive and cruise control was the cherry on the top (pun intended). More details to follow.", 8th November 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Pune,14,53

The logic behind the “fill before last 5% rule” (as told by a kind driver who taught me how to drive 35 plus years ago), used to be “there could be some sediments / dirt / rust settled at the bottom of the tank. This could get sucked in to the system and we end up with choked fuel flow.” Now this was another era and I am sure fuel quality has improved tremendously today and chances of impurities settled at the bottom are low, NOT totally ruled out though.

869, Newtown , 14:26 ,BHPian,"Fuel pumps are submerged into the fuel tank. This is what will happen if you run your fuel level too low: One, usually the suction filter of the fuel pump would filter out any debris in your tank. However, if your fuel level has gone way too low, the suction filter will suck up mostly debris and cause blockage of the fuel. Two, fuel pumps are cooled by the fuel. So you risk obliterating your fuel pump completely should it completely run out of fuel and start sucking in air. Three, even though your fuel tank has baffles, fuel moves around in the tank when one brakes or accelerates aggressively. If the fuel level is too low, you again risk pulling in air. While there is a low fuel light, most manufacturers will always suggest that you should not reach such a low level to refuel. Hence it is always best to refuel before the low fuel light comes on.", 17th November 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Bombay,209,994

With almost 2 weeks of usage i feel that the roof lining and wherever the felt lining is provided is not up to the levels you would find on the earlier Polo. The interior plastics i dont blame much because the touch and feel of plastics change as polymer technology progresses and now there would be much stronger and thinner options still maintaining the similar durability. One thing i like is that on the door handles a separate soft cushioning is provided which is good addition.

879, Guite , 21:51 ,BHPian,"Me and my family went showroom hopping today. First stop was VW, because 1. I have not seen the Taigun in cold metal flesh yet, 2. I am a German technology fanboy. Two takeaways from the experience are: 1. Interior lighting: Our visit was in the evening. Lighting level is low (not showroom level bright) and in green colour (see attached photo). So it was difficult to appreciate the interior material and colour. Are they trying to hide something? Even exterior colour looks different under any colour light except natural white light. Their rebranding designer seems to have mixed up somewhere. 2. Marketing executive wasn't as smart in attire and presentation as we have encountered in another showroom. Onto the car itself: the exposed sunroof mechanical is an eyesore. The cabin light switches are tacky: material, fit and finish are very poor. These days we have soft flip electrical wall switches. These cabin light switches belong to three decades back. Door window switches are slightly better, just slightly. Door seems lighter than my Vento, the heavy feel seems to come from the door hinge tensioning. Did I find anything good? Maybe. However I went with high expectations of German quality and precision engineering. This isn't one. Maybe the mechanicals are. But not on user touchpoints. By the way, I don't like the rear light bar.", 19th November 2021,volkswagen-taigun,"Noida,",732,624

PPS Motors were very prompt in bringing the car home for the test drive within an hour from when I enquired about the same! Firstly, there is no DSG shudder between D3-D2 while decelerating which I could sometimes perceive in my GT TSI. Smooth acceleration abound as I set off just as I'd drive my own car. At an open stretch I did a flat out acceleration from 40 to 80 and gosh! It was instant response from kick down, revs, till the shove Paddle shifters were awesome and I found them tactile as well as very ergonomic, any blip and it just goes to M mode and drifts back to D if there are no further inputs. Although the classic twin (digital) dial set up is missed, the graphics were sharp and very legible from behind the wheel. Perhaps the absence of sound deadening makes the engine audible during hard acceleration driving windows down, although NVH levels were very good with windows up. Hated the horn and the absence of one touch up/down, touch sensitive HVAC controls distracted me (this, one could get used to with time). Rest of the car beautifully falls in place for a current VW driver and strangely feels like an evolution of the Polo but sticking to within the class, interiors definitely do not feel like a class above for current Polo owners.

Good build too. 2. Virtual cockpit is really nice. Loved the red ambient light. 3. Overall space is good. Both front and rear seats offer good support. 4. 1.5 TSI DSG has good driveability. The power delivery is linear but strong. 5. I am not a fan of this engine sound at higher revvs. My Baleno K12 sounds sweet 6. Braking is good even with rear drums. 7. Steering felt light. I would have liked it slightly heavier. 8. Enthusiasts will love Taigun for driving pleasure. Dynamics are sorted. Good power with adequate control (even with those Goodyear tires). Tyre upgrade to Michelin / Continental would make it more enjoyable to drive 9. Reverse camera: I didn't like the quality of video. It was blurry. I hope it's something to do with the settings. 10. Speakers are made by Harman Kardon (as per SA). Sound quality is decent and majority won't complain. Audiophiles would need an upgrade. 11. VW needs to address fit and finish of certain areas in interiors. 12. Waiting period is 2-3 weeks for 1.5 TSI depending on the colour options. 1.0 TSI AT Top end (white) and 1.5 TSI MT (silver) Note the bigger 17 Inch alloys in 1.0 TSI AT top end. I think VW has provided training material for sales. It compares Taigun and Astor. SA had shared the same with me. They have quoted few lines from Team BHP in it. I had driven MG Astor Turbo AT before. Taigun is definitely more pleasing to drive.

900, thechinmay , 15:11 ,BHPian,"Had a TD of the 1.5 TSI DSG Taigun yesterday. While I haven't driven the new Creta, I have driven the previous gen Creta a fair bit. Most of my observations are benchmarked against that and my Polo GT. Positives: - The powertrain is absolutely brilliant. Loads of power throughout the rev range. The DSG seems smoother as well (could be a result of the more powerful engine or improvements in the gearbox itself) - It definitely is an enthusiastic handler. Turn in is sharp and immediate. The Creta feels 'larger' while the Taigun shrinks around you - The interior ambience is quite good. Love the integration of the infotainment in the dash and the ambient lighting at night - I think it's the best 4 seater in the segment. None of the competition are true 5 seaters anyways - The infotainment feels slick and has a very modern UI - The headlights have impressive throw. Especially coming from the Polo's pathetic stock units - The driver seat is pretty low set. Might be a disadvantage if you want a high driving position, but I preferred it Negatives: - The roofliner and the interior light switches are nasty. This is being fixed though - Hate that it drops the one touch windows for all doors like the older VWs - The boot is not the largest and the loading lip is quite deep - Should've had height adjustable seat belts The interior quality (apart from the roofliner) to me didn't feel like a downgrade from the Polo. Its pretty comparable to the Creta but might not be as good as the Astor's soft touch dashboard. The showroom experience at VW's Thane showroom was also great. I walked in late in the evening and at no point was I hurried to leave or asked to come back later. Overall its a great package and the perfect upgrade path for existing Polo/Vento owners.

908, vishy76 , 10:26 ,Distinguished - BHPian," Had a chance to sample both the ATs, that is the 1.0 TSI paired to the AISIN 6-Speed TC and the 1.5 TSI paired to the DQ200 7-speed DSG. Will list my observations down here: 1.5 TSI DSG - Good low end punch even though DSGs are known to be a tad sluggish in lower gears - An almost flat torque curve which was very surprising. There's no ""pushed back into the seat"" feeling when you floor the car or any drama. Power delivery is very quick and all that power is well spread out over the revv range unlike her 3-pot sibling - Make no mistake though, the 1.5 TSI is fast. Couple the point I mentioned before with the mature suspension setup, and it's very easy to miss that you have reached silly speeds - DQ200 lived upto all the hype. The GT came equipped with paddles but I decided to let the GB do the math and swap cogs. And it did that job brilliantly. Upshifts and downshifts were both equally quick and the infamous jerks that most people complained of in the previous iterations of this GB were non existent. - Overall refinement was also very good, though I personally wasn't a fan of the engine note at higher revvs. Won't say it sounds strained (quite the opposite infact), but I somehow prefer the raspy and raw engine note of the 1.0 TSI. It assumes more of a thrum upto 3000rpm which then turns into a muted growl - Didn't get to sample the ACT (active cylinder technology), but the salesperson was quite enthusiastic in pointing out that the larger 1.5 TSI 4-pot gets better FE than the 1.0 TSI 3-pot due to this very reason All in all, this engine+GB combo will sure be a USP for the Taigun. VW has got it spot on with mating the dry clutch DSG to their TSI (as always). Having said that, the long term reliability (especially clutch pack and flywheel replacement costs) coupled with the price (around 19.68L OTR here for the GT 1.5 TSI DSG) are dampeners apart from the overall interior quality (will come to that later). 1.0 TSI TC After sampling the 1.5 TSI, I didn't have high hopes from the 1.0 TSI. I think it's obvious why. Even on paper, the 1.0 TSI (AT especially) is a lot slower comapred to the 1.5 DSG. However, I was in for quite a surprise. - Bottom end was average as expected. The TC was doing a good job of masking a majority of it though - Beyond 2000rpm is where the punch lies. After the below average low end, the mid range and the top end feel explosive relatively. This makes the 1.0 TSI feel faster than it actually is. It's an engine which just begs to be driven hard and fast - I constantly found myself keeping the revvs beyond 2000-2500 rpm at any cost and gunning the car at every given opportunity. The raspy engine note (might not be appreciated by the average Joe) was also keeping me good company through all this - The 6-speed AISIN TC did its job well, but not as well as the DSG. Shifts were perceptible and sudden throttle inputs were met with a slight delay in downshifting as expected. Having said that, it is butter smooth under low to medium throttle inputs and did a good job of masking the 1.0's turbo lag - Coming to refinement, I would say it's excellent for a 3-pot. The engine comes to life with minimal vibration and there's not much of a giveaway on the inside that it is a 3 cylinder. Having said that, there's no comparison to her 4-pot sibling here. The 1.5 TSI is definitely better, especially for someone who isn't a fan of the engine being very audible inside as the revvs climb In conclusion, the 1.0 TSI doesn't feel like a slouch, even in comparison to the 1.5 TSI. However, that's subject to one major factor, the driving style. If you are a sedate driver, the 1.0 TSI's constant demand for throttle inputs won't bode well with you. The turbo lag will further make matters difficult. The 1.5 TSI on the other hand is an all rounder. It doesn't mind being driven sedately, it doesn't mind being driven hard either. The ACT might also mean you get better fuel economy in the end (if driven sedately that is). - Coming to the ride and handling, I found the suspension setup to be very competent by segment standards. The Tiagun and Kushaq both use ZF Dampers (Made in China), which I believe should be a step up to the Monroe and Gabriel's used on the Polo/Vento that had several complaints. - Low speed ride is a touch on the stiffer side (it's not as stiff as my Jetta though). As the speeds increase, most bumps and potholes are dismissed off with a muted thud audible inside the cabin - Having said that, high speed handling has two minor dampeners. The first is the steering. Make no mistake, it's pinpoint accurate like most of the other VAGs, but it doesn't weigh up all that much. The second is the body roll. Though well controlled, it's not as good as the VAG group sedans one might be used to - Braking was very reassuring even with drum brakes on the rear axle. The brake pedal feel and overall bite (even after several rounds of hammering on the highway) didn't leave any room for complains All in all, I feel the suspension setup is actually quite well suited for the 'aam junta'. In the end, ride quality takes precedence over pinpoint accurate, razor sharp handling for most people and the Taigun manages to strike a good balance here. A few more points about the car itself: - Overall exterior and paint quality is the same as her Skoda sibling with little to no difference visible - Interior quality is a notch better than the Kushaq. I found bits like the steering mounted controls and even the quality of leather on the steering to be better than the Kushaq - Having said that, I won't call it class leading by any means. The Astor takes the lead there. The quality of some plastics on the door pads and even the dash does leave a lot to be desired. The headliner is still the same cheap one used in the Kushaq. - The only ergonomic flaw in the entire cabin was the touchscreen climatronic console. It sits too low and I found myself constantly glancing down at it to adjust the air con settings. - The centre armrest and rear ac vent console in both TD cars had developed an extremely annoying rattle. The entire console was shaking and rattling badly over less than ideal roads - The map light console switches (especially for the rear) felt cheap to touch. They were rock hard and had very poor tactile feedback, though the lights themselves are very cool looking LEDs In the end, is the Taigun a good car? For someone who values driving dynamics and engine options over everything else, it's an excellent car make no mistake. However, do I think it's good enough to command 19.7L for the top end GT 1.5 TSI DSG here in Vadodara? The answer to that would be a no IMO.

911, 84.monsoon , 18:02 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Had a detailed look at both the Taigun and the Kushaq. Although I had seen both the cars briefly in fly-by visits to the dealership in the early days of launch, I wanted to have an in-depth look, after reading pages and pages of complaints about the interiors of these cars on this forum. So decided to spend 20 minutes each with the Taigun and the Kushaq today. Being a Sunday, showrooms for not crowded especially given all the rains here. A friend is interested in picking one of them and was looking for some reassurance about the interiors. I started by dropping into the nearby Volkswagen showroom and the first one I saw was a GT 1.5 TSI Manual in Wild Cherry color was on display. In one word, Wow! This car is a looker from the outside, especially this shade. Someone uninitiated about our car market would probably guess this car belongs to the 25 - 30 Lakh segment, just looking at it from the outside. (This particular variant retails at 14.99 ex-showroom). What came as a bit of a let-down was that the headlights were actually halogen and not LED not were there LED DRLs. It felt like VW had intentionally omitted important features in this trim to make sure it does not cannibalize the Topline 1.0 MT which is only 50K cheaper. With a much more powerful imported engine with ACT, the GT Manual is exceptional value in my eyes, had they not dropped the LED headlights, cruise control and a few other key features. Lifting the bonnet up, it appeared to have medium heft - heavier than the Maruti's and previous generation Hyundais, about as heavy as the Creta/Seltos but significantly lighter than the Compass/Harrier and even my 2020 Thar. The 1.5 TSI engine fits snugly into the Bay, leaving very little open space. This GT manual trim had 16 inch alloys that looked fairly well sized for the car and the alloy pattern was a classic, good-looking one. The doors are of medium build and weight and the ""Thunk"" is certainly missing although they shot firmly and precisely with a healthy sound. I checked both the front door and the back door, and to me, there did not appear to be significant difference in their weight and heft (My Ecosport which had very heavy front doors but really light rear doors). As soon as I entered the car, I was welcomed by the nice new car smell that is getting rarer to find these days among some new cars in the market. Mahindra cars, for example, definitely do not have this welcoming nice smell, and instead smell more like tires/rubber. I must say the red interior trim is an absolute eyesore. Even on the red car it looked jarring, imagine it is also present on the GT manual grey and silver where it would look absolutely out of place. The only external colors that are spared the ghastly red treatment in the GT Manual are the yellow and white. I really hope VW realizes this quickly and makes them an option/add-on. There is a small amount of padding on the doors, which I suspect will not be sufficient on long journeys to rest the elbow comfortably. The Centre arm rest is ergonomically perfect (although has sub-standard finish) - it has a fairly long range of adjustment and set up the perfect height. Overall, the seats were very comfortable and sufficiently firm to ensure that long journeys do not turn into pains in the back. There are hard plastics everywhere, however I did not feel them to be distracting or look cheap. On the other hand, on the Kushaq, the top of the dashboard had a kind of grains that drew attention to the shiny and hard nature of surface. The seat fabric on the Tiguan GT was par for the course - IMO, it did not appear rough or badly stitched by any means. The highline 1.0 trim I saw later had worse cloth fabrics though. The touchscreen ICS absolutely dominates the front dashboard - very well placed and the display quality was really crisp well . I found the old fashioned, basic speed dials on the GT Manual to be a real disappointment. Hi VW, after all, this is a GT - a driver's car. The owner is going to be looking at the speed and RPM, a lot more than owners of the Dynamic Line cars. At least, give us a hooded high quality dials that the previous generation Jetta or Yeti used to have! There have been a lot of complaints about the roof liner - Yes it is not very well finished but IMO, it did not appear as shocking as some others pointed out. Maybe I notice roof liners less than the average car buyer does! Would I call it a beautifully finished roof ? Absolutely not. Would I call it distractingly poor quality that would bother me every time I get into the car? I wouldn’t say so. One disappointing thing though is that even the GT manual trim does not get a sunglass holder on the roof. (The Kushaq Ambition does, BTW). I now popped into the back and the space is absolutely enormous - it is easily the best in segment in terms of legroom and kneeroom and possibly headroom as well. The Centre armrest is at a perfect height and is quite broad. I would say the rear passenger comfort level probably the best in segment for two passengers. Completely agree with others about the backseat not being wide enough for three, but I would much rather seat two in comfort 100% of the time than permanently compromise on their comfort, just because somebody might use a middle seat 10% of the time. The 60-40 split folding rear seats tumble to provide an enormous amount of cargo room - it should be easily possible to squeeze in a bicycle here. Driver seat ergonomics are spot-on and the seat adjustments available made it possible for me to find a very comfortable driving position very quickly. Visibility is excellent and the steering is an absolute delight to hold - small and chunky with a nice flat bottom. The clutch a soft however I was really surprised at the amount of travel required. Even for me who ears size 11.5 shoes, it was not possible to operate this clutch with the bottom of my heel resting on the floor or only slightly raised, like I used to do on my Ecosport TDCI. I had to take my foot completely off the floor, raise it and then depress the clutch. The gear shifts were very positive and precise, however, the throws are a tad longer than what I would expect. The Polo is the absolute benchmark here - the gear throws on that car were so short and the feedback so positive, I would shift gears juts for the fun of shifting. What is absolutely inexcusable is that VW has not provided cruise control on its top GT trim in the manual version. The car cost a full 15 lakhs ex-showroom and close to 19 lakhs on Road. The typical buyer is going to buy this trim for the pleasure of driving and for covering long distances on highways and cruise control is an absolute necessity under those conditions. I have found this feature to be hugely relaxing and strain-reducing, because it allows you to take your foot of the pedal, flex your right feet and give it some rest. I then had a looks at some other colors - The yellow looks absolutely stunning as well. If I were buying the GT manual, I would find it hard to choose between Yellow and Red had it not been for the red interior bits on the latter. The yellow GT has dark grey bits in place of the red bits that blend nicely with the rest of the elements and reassure you once again that you are in a VW car. The display car had accessories demonstrating how one could carry a bike on top of the car, but honestly, I would hesitate to mount my bicycle this way, given the level of air resistance that’s likely to cause - I always prefer to mount the bike sideways at the rear of the car. The top end variant in white was next up, and it does have very nice diamond cut alloy wheels, elevating the level of sophistication of the car. The amount of Chrome was a tad too much on this one in my view. I then hopped over to the Skoda showroom next, to have a look at the Kushaq. From the front, the car looks imposing (as comparted to the Taigun which looked more sharp and handsome than imposing). It could easily be mistaken for a Karoq or even a Kodiaq from a distance. The level of heft of the bonnet and doors appeared to be similar tot he Taigun (naturally). The interior of the top end Style trim looked really amazing - the material and the stitching on the seats were fine, and the steering wheel absolutely dazzling, with a two-spoke design and chrome bits that are peppered over it. From a drivers vantage point, I would say, I prefer the interiors of the Kushaq Style Trim over the equivalent Topline trim of the Taigun. However, if you are shopping for the Ambition trim, there’s a fatal flaw - the interior quality takes a nosedive in the ambition mainly because of the cloth used - it is worse than what you would see on the sofas of a low-end teashop. Even on a new car, they looked pathetic and they could be quite uncomfortable, given how rough the surface is, especially if you are wearing shorts and your skin is in contact with the seats. Sitting in the backseat of the top-end style trim of the Kushaq, I was surprised to see a big zipper running down the side of the front seat. It looked completely after-market, I generally don’t see the factory fitted seats with such visible zippers. This means one could probably easily buy the same seat cover and put that on top of the ambition trim and you now have a much nicer interior. The big advantage that the Kushaq offers in the Ambition (middle) trim over the Taigun are the LED headlamps and cruise control. My recommendation to my friend is therefore going to be to go for the Kushaq Ambition with the seat covers from the Style trim - the SA confirmed these were readily available. I then had a quick look at the new Octavia, tried pulling open the door of that car after you have been opening and closing the Taigun and the Kushaq's doors, and it seems like you’re suddenly trying to move a mountain! The doors are so heavy ! The interiors of the are far improved over the previous generation and look close to the German flagship benchmarks. However what I found very disappointing with Octavia is the interior space, especially in the backseat, is nowhere as previous generation car that I had been in numerous times as it used to run as the default taxi all over Europe. Headroom also seemed to have suddenly fallen short. They might have done this to differentiate the car from the Superb and maybe start positioning the Superb for the taxi segment. The virtual cockpit of the Octavia is a completely different class altogether when compared to the one on the top-end Tiguan - the resolution and clarity is several notches higher - the simplicity and elegance of this virtual cockpit is simply unmatched and M&M has literally copied it pat down in the XUV 700.

Perfectly penned. I suggested the same to my friend who was confused between Taigun and Kushaq for 1.5 dsg, to pick Kushaq. Upgrading from Rapid he was unhappy with the quality of plastics, especially the black top of Kushaq. Taigun was equally bad. But while Taigun looks ‘techy’ Kushaq looked like a mini Karoq from both front and back and I believe that there is a 40k discount. Also 4 years maintenence pack and 6 years warranty is more reassuring considering he’s getting the dq200 box. I also drove the Xuv700 petrol automatic and felt the performance is stronger than the VAG cars, more effortless too. Stability was also good. Features were extensive and I felt the plastic quality on dash to be better too, though it wasn’t put together the same solid way as Vw. ADAS features worked well too. Especially the adaptive cruise and lane keeping. It even braked from 110 - 60kmph when I hit a patch of water on the highway at speed and showed a message that I was carrying too much speed for the surface. I felt the 360 camera to also be of good quality. But for the waiting period and reliability concerns with a new Mahindra it would have been my first recommendation. Adding my pics : PS : The last pic I posted is the Octavia. Though it felt really solid and had excellent plastics, the black plasticky dash top looked cheaper than the previous octavia which had a leather look dashtop. I think that leads many who are upgrading from Polo / Vento to feel the same about Kushaq.", 29th November 2021,volkswagen-taigun,Tiruchirapalli,134,559

I dont think anybody wanting a 'big looking car' will shortlist Taigun, there is XL6 and Alcazar available in comparable budget range. Taigun is a loser there. Taigun has a strictly half 5th seat, uncomfortable for long drives, but 5th seat in most cars would be uncomfortable for long drives. Luggage space is good, Smaller than Creta but I have checked both Venue and Sonet, its larger than both of them. What differentiates Taigun (1.5 GT) by huge margin is the drive and handling, the pleasure you get when you push the accelerator is unmatched in the segment (have driven Creta 1.4 Turbo, Astor 1.3 Turbo Sonet 1.0 turbo for comparison). For Taigun ride quality is comparable to Troc, it will leave you with a smile on highways when you decide to accelerate.

However this interpretation of the digital cockpit is quite different from the one found in the Octavia and the Audi cars.

Finally, after clinging on to my FIATs for the past 12 years, I thought the time has come for me to move on. I am holding back my 12 year old Punto for city runs and my wife will still use it to drive to work. I am planning to let go of the Linea Tjet once the new vehicle is delivered. I have been looking around since the past couple of weeks for the next car and infact booked an MG Astor 1.4 NA Manual Smart variant. Last week, we went with family and visited showrooms and saw Taigun, Kushaq, Creta, Kia Seltos and MG Hector in flesh. No Test drives. But just to get family to select which they liked the best in terms of looks, sturdiness, seating convenience, boot space, audio and features. Family unanimously voted for Taigun and MG Astor as shortlists. Kushaq came a close 3rd but wifey liked the VW looks than the Skoda and hence it finally boiled down to the two. Between Astor and Taigun, we had multiple debates and finally decided on the Taigun based on the following arguments 1. MG as a brand itself is new in India and has very thin service network. When we are putting Rs.20 lakhs on a new purchase, my wife was very clear we wanted to put that money on a brand which has been around for longer time and has better service network and proven longevity of their vehicles in Indian roads. Between MG and VW, it was a no brainer. 2. For me, coming from a Linea Tjet, I know 1.5 GT TSI is a very capable petrol engine and is expected to beat the Tjet and I will not be feeling the purchase as a downgrade. 3. The build quality of Taigun is very similar to the Punto and Tjet and that would not be a downgrade as well. The sales person has scheduled an appointment for Test drive this Friday for the 1.5GT TSI MT version which I intend to take along with family before making the final decision to book the vehicle. When I saw that you have done the Test drive for Taigun, I was very happy because growing up with a Punto for 2 lakh + kms who else can be a better judge to do the comparison and if there are any cons that you noticed that I should be aware of.

Thank you for your help. Good choice. I didn't miss anything when driving the Taigun and feel that the 1.5 TSi is a good upgrade option for us. 1.5 TSi has a better low end and more useable performance than the 1.4 TJet and you should feel right at home with everything about the vehicle. Only slight letdown is the interior quality (and I was especially disappointed with the grey and dull colour scheme of the Kushaq which reminds me of that in the Punto!), but the Taigun fares better there IMHO.

Finally was able to have back to back test drives of all 4 vehicles (Kushaq 1.0/1.5 and Taigun 1.0/1.5) Things that totally made me feel let down - 1.) Drive quality is very very average, was in the market for a second vehicle after selling my Etios Liva TRD Sportivo but looks like none of these fit the bill in terms of a smooth ride (like a 7 speed 2012 Altis AT petrol or 2012 Jetta Diesel,). Some members on this forum have expressed the same kind of disappointment and happy to go back home in their i20s and balenos. Maybe old school and not very happy with the Turbo Engines. For the STOP and GO kind of traffic and driving conditions in Mumbai these cars (the AT versions) are a big no in my opinion. It just feels one is constantly trying to push the car forward and suddenly braking. Almost tiring and can get to a feeling "" A man on constant sorrow "" kind of a feeling. 2.) Gadgets and gizmos are not at all important for me unless they are to do with convenience and safety (like auto open / close trunk , auto up down on all 4 windows) so not going to add to the fact that these twins are nowhere close to the KIA / MG equivalents. But the sound quality for this quality and build of a car is just POOR POOR POOR. Terrible at times. 3.) For city driving just could not feel significant difference in pickup and quality between the 3 pot 1.0 engine and 4 pot 1.5 engine which was the biggest let down. After reading all the reviews and opinions on Team BHP was mentally preparing for the 21 lac plunge but the 1.5 just did not do it for me. 4.) The AC is definitely questionable, a larger 8 year old car was able to cool faster and quieter in the auto setting at 23C then the SKODA/VW twins. In exactly the same conditions. Some things to look out for prospective buyers - 1.) The VW 1.0 AT drove much better as compared to the SKODA 1.0 AT. 2.) If you prefer a constant REV sound (go for 1.0) the 1.5 is comparatively silent. 3.) The handbrake is short and has a very weird position and with an extended armrest will be irritating for taller people. 4.) DO NOT go by the external size inside leg room is excellent and the best part the HUMP is only about 2 inches so can easily seat a normal weight and heighted 5th person. If optimization of space, look and feel good factor were my criteria would have booked either of these today itself. But the AT drive quality was a complete let down. But hats off to VW/SKODA to come out with these cars. They are the complete package for someone who is looking to upgrade from the likes of maruti/MnM/Tata/Hyundai and who has not driven AT vehicles with larger engines.

When the Engine start button is pushed, it continues cranking for a few seconds rather than firing up. Have to stop and push start again. Anyone else faced it? 2. Not sure if I am missing anything, but the text keyboard doesn't seem to have the input for symbol ""="" in it. 3. When the vehicle is on smooth roads, everything is great. NVH is super. But on broken, bad or uneven roads, there is a good amount of creaking/squeaking sounds from the doors, probably from the flexing of the frame against the rubber linings. Something to fix in the first service. 4. Would anyone have any recommendation on a good USB C type to C type cable for both data and charging? Should I have got a OEM cable with the car? 5.

After driving an i10 Asta for over a decade, it was more than necessary to get to a new car. We decided to go ahead and get a Taigun Topline 1.0MT. We discounted the Kia Seltos because of the GNCAP ratings and long wait times for the Creta meant it was not an option. Further, we actually wanted a car that looked and felt a little smaller (while not compromising on rear leg space!) than the Korean twins for city driving. The 'feel' of the German engines was really good for a VW newbie like myself. I test drove the Kushaq and Taigun a few times and found driving on the Taigun a little easier in city traffic as the Kushaq clutch felt a little tight on two different test drives. A minor point but the Taigun seatbelt feels really smooth and my wife preferred the external look to the Taigun as well. Unfortunately, the Highline misses a few key features I wanted (6 airbags, tire pressure monitor, and digital cockpit) so had to go with the Topline. I also spoke to a few VW owners and looked at a number of online reviews and Youtube videos before taking a call.

Would be comparing my impressions to Polo GT(I own a 1.2 TSI) and Kushaq and Seltos (have driven in the past) Exterior Finish ,Paint and Build Quality is at par with all local VAG products (Polo/Vento/Rapid) Interior finish and build is on par with a Polo but not strictly a step up. Makes sense as this is the global Polo platform but given the price of the top end ,some people are expecting Jetta levels of quality which is just not there and too wishful to expect it considering the car prices today] Seating Position is near perfect for a crossover, a bit better than Kushaq maybe because of the higher dashboard design. Tilt and Telescopic steering definitely helps. I like to sit nice and Low. The Engine and gearbox seemed a bit more aggressive than the Kushaq which was very linear. DSG is definitely much faster than a Seltos DCT. Engine is very refined and power feels just a bit better than a stage 1 1.2 TSI polo. Steering is just way too light for the enthusiasts, just like Kushaq. at least seltos gets that right with the drive modes. this needs to be coded to get the steering weight right in the Taigun Handling is really good and i felt the suspension to be just a touch stiffer than the Kushaq. I don't know if there is genuinely a difference in the tuning of suspension between the two cars but the Taigun felt more fun to drive because of this, and lesser body roll. interested buyers should definitely drive both back to back and then decide. TD car had done around 6k kms and the brakes felt considerably worse than the nearly new Kushaq i drove earlier in the year. Either the car is thrashed a lot or the Pad compound is crap. Rear seat space, especially the legroom is fantastic, a full level above the seltos. This makes it a really good upgrade for the current Ecosport owners. I wanted to TD the 1.5 MT to get a feel of the MT gearbox (MQ281), but sadly no Test drives. The dealer did have one car on display and all I could do was row through the gears standing still, felt better than most VAG MTs, but i would reserve my judgement till i get a proper drive. The dealer also did have 3 1.5 MT cars in stock, the only ones he had for ready delivery. Clearly Low feature set is not a hit with the enthusiasts Base model, Comfortline has a quoted period of almost a year. others are better with realistic times of 2-3 months.

I honestly can't say much about the build quality of both the cars as both seemed pretty solid to me. The car hunt began in 2020 as a joke, as a consequence of not being in the right timeline to end up with a Punto Abarth, day dreaming of the next best thing - a Polo TSi, and come December 2021, I found myself doing a PDI of a car I never thought I'd buy. I hope my dreams never come true. I love the Taigun exactly for the same reasons as the Polo: - Cruise control: I wanted to try this especially because a friend who drives an AT verna also has cruise control and choses not to use it. I set it up at 79km/hr on the Mumbai Pune expressway and just focussed on the road. I can't wait to do this again. - TC gearbox: I briefly looked at Renaults offerings in the Polos price range, but didn't want to go the non TC gearbox route. Driving my uncles 2021 Baleno CVT also didn't instil excitement. TC was the way to go without having any benchmark to base this decision on. I was tired of driving our 2007 Innova MT and wanted an automatic car as my first car. - a potent engine with a scope for DIY - this was for Polo. I've religiously followed BHPian fluidicjoys diy threads and was blown away by the kinda potential Polo holds for mods. I'm also glad that I'm not going to have to do any of those now that a Taigun stands in the garage. I'm all for ""built not bought"" (but ""built after I bought"" really) and I am the primary service advisor, head mechanic, chai wala and chief accountant when it comes to the maintenance of my 2017 Dominar, having added functional and aesthetic mods on it. But I want a break from all that diy and focus on the driving a bit more this time. - everything that the Polo doesn't have is an addon on the Taigun and I don't have particular excitement over the value addition of these features except for the ventilated seats. Mom was surprised to know that such a thing exists and was happy and comfortable throughout the lonavala drive on delivery day. The paddle shifters are an addon I was going to add to the Polo but happy for it to come as standard on the Taigun, although I am waiting to cross over 1-1.5k on the odo to use them. However, the Polo has a lot of character over the Taigun. This will never stop being true for me. The allure of the sunroof quickly faded away now that our car has it. The Innova which stands in the garage doesn't have a sunroof and both my mom and I used to wonder what it'd be like to have a car with a sunroof. Uncle with his XUV500 encouraged putting the head outta the sunroof when the car stood still and the experience was pleasant. Now that there is one on the Taigun, I don't think we've looked up more than once through it. We just end up removing the roof liner cover and that's that. It just sits there, we're happy it is there but we'd be indifferent if it weren't. I love the wheel setup as well. On a smooth tarmac, the car glides. As if riding on an aircraft. The road noise is absent and I just love the way it drives. On concrete tarmac, the story is a bit different. There is a fair amount of road noise, the undulations are felt in the cabin and it starts making sense as to why the 16 inch tyres are a better swap for this car. Not that I'm going to right away or later as well, but it did debunk a thought I had in my mind when I used to read about most of the folks preferring the 16 inch wheels over the 17inch setup. I also find it weird that the car on PDI and on delivery day seemed so tall, and now that it is with me and among other cars, it just feels short. Like me. I love the gearbox but can only talk so much about it right now. I've done around 288 km, 77 was the odo meter mark when I took delivery. U-turns are scary. Probably because I'm not willing to floor the car right now hence a mild panic sets inside of me trying to negotiate a u-turn with a sense of calming urgency. Will I make it, will I not? Will the truck driver uncle curse at me, will he not? Or maybe because when I press the accelerator, the car has a noticeable delay until it darts forward (probably in d2) and pushes me back into the seat. The headlight setup is a miss for me. I wish for something more powerful. It reminds me of my struggle with my Dominar. It looks good when I'm alone on the road. I can scare insects, owls, and make the moon blush on a full moon day, but if a halogen power guy comes in the opposite lane, I'm sure to miss a bump or a pothole. These lights also perform poorly for me when someone with a powerful setup is behind me, the effect of my headlights gets cancelled and blends with the more powerful setup. I've always thought these LED headlights with the kinda temperature Dominar has to be a problem and the ones on the Taigun will inspire no confidence on that front. Good to have the fog lamps in an aesthetically out of sync color temperature. I've had my eyes tested and my doctor said I have a good vision. As long as I could see her, it was 6/6. The car does hold gears properly. On the TD car, I felt it did spend a fair amount of time in D2 even at lower speeds but that doesn't seem to be the case with the car I've got. How and why I went in for a polo and came out with a taigun in a span of 2 months is something that is in the works on the assembly line. Hope to cover a lot of the things other than what I've mentioned on the post. However, I have a lot of gratitude towards BHPian sameer_vwagner, soumyajena whose virtual presence has made me buying my first car a smooth experience. I couldn't have done it without Sameer's encouragement and Soumya's help moving to a different dealership in the Mumbai area.

Hey throttlehead, thank you for the wishes.

The reason he told me was that Acko didn't have a cashless garage tie up (I couldn't find it as well on the website), and given this was a VW purchase, I kinda wanted to have a peace of mind for any situation that might arise where I have to go through the insurance claim route. Insurance was the last payment I made and I just assumed that my OTR will come down to ₹17.31. I jumped to the Taigun because I had a hunch that I might be able to bring down the OTR from the claimed ~₹ 19+. I was already negotiating for the Polo on the BH series and insurance and found that there was a significant difference in prices while still being able to add the extended warranty.

The dashboard shows you that a door is open, I also think the steering does not lock when a door is left ajar (but needs to be verified) so its the drivers duty to check that all doors are closed before leaving the car.

1025, differential , 13:34 ,BHPian,"Took delivery of our Taigun Topline AT in December 2021 in the cherry red. This car is going to be primarily driven inside the city and is a replacement for our 7 year polo GT TSI. The car has completed about 900km so far. The drives were a mix of city, highway and hills. We were a confused between the topline AT and the GT plus and finally went with the Topline AT. Observations after 900km: Pros: 1. The car is super spacious and the boot size is deceptive. The boot can hold a lot. 2. The suspension is on the firmer side and the ground clearance with full load is good. Didn't scape even once over huge potholes and speed breakers with full load. The car is sorted at speeds of 100- 110kmph and the brakes are good. 3. The car has enough and more creature comforts and is on par with the competition. 4. The TC gearbox has a jumpy start, but is comfortable for city use and bumper to bumper traffic. 5. Streeing is light, making city drives and parking easy. Outside visibility is good with a fair range of seat adjustment. 6. Wireless CarPlay and wireless charging seem to be working as advertised and is convenient. 7. Ventilated seats, though noisy at max setting - work well. This is a first for me, never used one before. But its nice. Cons: 1. Quality and feel seem lower than polo. 2. HU audio quality is very average. 3. The 1.0 TSI is not the engine for spirited driving and is more suited for cruising. The engine struggles with full load and 4 passengers to reach cruising speeds. Once u reach speeds of 100-110 kmph it cruises comfortably. The GB shifts to 6th gear only around 70 to 80 kmph when the engine reaches around 2000 rpm. 4. Fuel efficiency is not a strong point. B to B crawling traffic on our regular commute is around 9 kmpl. Highway efficiency with 80 to 110kmph speeds is around 13kmpl. 5. The digital display seems like a half baked attempt for the sake of giving one. Would have seriously preferred the Kushaq's analog display. Cars considered: Kushaq / Taigun. Why? Most of our cars are VAG and we didn't actually consider the Korean twins. Why Taigun instead of Kushaq? This is going to be my wife's car and she liked the Taigun better and wanted to stick with the VW brand. I liked the looks of the Kushaq mainly because of less chrome and analog dials. The Taiguns rear lights look better. Honestly, I liked both equally and couldn't differentiate much between the 2 cars mechanically and drive wise. If this was our primary car I would have hands down chosen the 1.5 L with the DSG. The 1.5 also has a fair bit more torque and power. Yes, the DSG has its own problems. But having used DSGs in over 5 VAG cars, I still feel its performance is in a different league. And we have had DSG problems with one car and its been addressed satisfactorily. Why 1.0 TSI? Though jumpy at the start, its actually better to drive in city traffic. Our yearly mileage for this car will be less than 7000km and 95% will be city traffic. And we are planning to hold on to this car for at least 7 years. What would I like to have been better? Audio / speaker quality. Though not an audiophile, the sound quality is very very average. Looking at speaker swap options. The AC seems to take it own time to cool. This is not summer yet. Have to wait to see the actual performance in summer and with more usage. All the above observations are my personal views over 1 month. I might be biased regarding the driving experiences as my comparisons are with Polo GT TSI 1.2L and Octavia Vrs.

Once my wife shuts the door, the car will blink again to indicate the open door is now locked. The same applies if boot is open.", 18th January 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Deutschland,234,511

When I went to take delivery of the car and they were demonstrating it to me, the LHS door mirror closed with such a loud squeak and continued to do so each time I locked and unlocked the car. I did not fuss over it too much and sprayed silicone lubricant between the plastics and the sound stopped. So if you hears squeaks (and not rattles), get yourselves a can of silicone spray.

I am in the market for a crossover to replace my 7 year old Polo. I did test drive both the Taigun GT Plus and the Kushaq Style back to back over 2 days (Both were the 1.5 TSI DSG versions). The Taigun TD vehicle had clocked over 6000 kms whereas the Kushaq TD vehicle had over 3000 kms on it. There is some truth in what the video states. The power delivery in the Taigun GT was more linear. In contrast to that, the turbo in the Kushaq would kick in suddenly leading to a jolt in acceleration. This made driving the Taigun much easier compared to the Kushaq. Ride Quality was equally stiff in both, but I believe that was to be attributed to the tires being over-inflated. I took another test drive of the Taigun where I got the test drive vehicle's tires pressure set to 33 psi at the nearest petrol pump. The vehicle rode comfortably (Plush enough for a VW ) after that. I dint notice any difference in regular braking between both the cars. I cannot comment on high speed braking, as I dint take either of the cars out on the highway. Similarly ,handling was similar in both at regular speeds. Cannot comment on high speed manners. The wife felt the interior of the Taigun to be better than the Kushaq in touch and feel, even though the dashboard in the Kushaq at first glance looks better. Regular touch points (Steering controls, door handles, AC vents etc) felt better in the Taigun. The Taigun is cheaper, better equipped, drives better and feels better.

I hope to have it home by February end Quote: Originally Posted by sid3091 I think ventilated seats and a subwoofer are two decent points in the kushaq's favor. @Sid3091: Thank you for your response. You may have noticed that the previous post was my first on this esteemed forum. Its heartening to see a response so quickly. I do agree with your point. Objectively, the Taigun is missing the subwoofer and the ventilated seats in the GT Plus variant. To add onto that, the leatherette seats in the Kushaq's style variant are marginally better quality than the fabric seats in the Taigun GT Plus. That is an important distinction, as the leatherette seats impart a comparatively plush interior feel to the Kushaq compared to the functional/spartan feel in the Taigun GT Plus. That being said, my observation is purely from a subjective standpoint. I am no audiophile, and am pretty happy with my 7 year old Polo's stock music system. My ears will probably not miss a subwoofer. I stay in Bangalore and my car generally finds a covered car park wherever we go, so ventilated seats are not too big a miss. I do have little bit of an eye for details though. In my books, the Taigun scores better in the fit and finish department (No offense intended to current Kushaq owners, just a personal observation). For example, the isofix points in the Kushaq style variant seem uneven Link compared to the Taigun Link. The rotary knobs on the Kushaq's steering look real nice at first glance Link till you touch them and realize that they are plastic ""and"" have a bit of flex to them. The AC vent controls on the Kushaq have already been discussed Ad Nauseum on this forum. All that being said, the Taigun is not a perfect car either in fit and finish. The rear cabin light switches are hideous and it takes a lot of effort to toggle them. The GT Plus seat covers have uneven/amateur grade contrast red stitching and have a zipper securing them to the seat The pedestrian grade roof-liner, exposed sunroof mechanism, the ugly grey shade of the center console are common to both the Taigun and the Kushaq. The door handles are plastic, far removed from the brushed metal ones on my current polo. But these are the signs of our times I guess. The Kushaq and Taigun will get better with time. Their next iteration/facelift will cover all the shortcomings we see right now. My only concern is if I wait for the facelift, would the Taigun still cost me Taigun money or would it cost me T-Roc money (Sponsored by Inflation/""Rising Input Costs"" ).", 31st January 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,64,127

The 1.4 TSI as far as the reviews went, would run out of breath beyond 5000 rpm. This is where I found out. You can quickly scroll down to 4.4 min. Hope it helps. https://youtu.be/IlUyejEITgU ", 4th February 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Chennai,102,108

Occupancy at max would be 4 adults with luggage on long trips. Hello. I have recently test driven both the Topline AT as well as the GT Plus, before I went ahead and made a booking for the GT Plus. Here are my two cents: Your purchase decision would primarily be based on how the engine and the gearbox behave. I experienced the following: Topline AT - Engine: The 1.0 TSI is a fun motor to drive. It is very rev happy, and begs to be driven hard. That being said, the low end torque delivery is very regular. I drive a Polo 1.2 MPI and can say that below 2000 RPM, I couldnt notice much difference between how the two. The turbo in the 1.0 TSI spools around 1800-1900 rpm. So the engine wakes up past 2000 rpm, and thats where the fun begins. The engine pulls cleanly starting 2500 rpm all the way to the redline. The engine note in the mid range and top end are nice to experience (If you like that sort of thing !!). But that is the catch with the 1.0 TSI, you need to rev the engine to enjoy it. Low end torque is good enough for city commuting but not that much fun. And obviously you rev the engine and your FE drops correspondingly. I dint take the test drive car onto the highway but I assume it will be able to cruise without much effort (Thanks to the tall gearing). But yes quick overtakes and hill duty will need usage of the mid to top end quiet a lot. Topline AT - TC Gearbox: I dont have enough experience to do a blow by blow comparison of the TC and DSG gearboxes. DSG is quicker but imperceptibly so compared to the TC. The only observation was with respect to the paddles. Using them would force the gearbox into manual mode (Obviously!). Now the TC would return to auto mode automatically in a few seconds after paddle usage (Not so in the DSG). GT Plus - Engine: The 1.5 TSI has a different character. It doesnt rev as easily as the 1.0 TSI, nor does it push all the way to the red line (Shorter torque curve). But what it does have is low end torque (Bigger displacement engine). The turbo spools quicker (Around 1700 RPM), but frankly the car is very drivable even before the turbo kicks in. In city conditions, you wouldnt need to rev the engine. The pre-turbo torque is enough for puttering around. on your local roads. And when the turbo does kick in, the torque delivery is more mature and linear in nature. The more you press on the A pedal, the further you get pushed into your seats You have total control on the power/torque delivery. I again, couldn't take the car out on to the highway, but I assume the low end and mid range would be enough for effortless cruising. The torque figures I believe should be enough to do hairpin buds with a full load, at any gear. On top of the reduced amount of revving required, the 1.5 TSI has ACT as well. The car's auto start stop, low revs and ACT should result in fantastic FE. GT Plus - DSG Gearbox: The 1.5 TSI engine is a gem of an engine. It doesn't frankly need the DSG gearbox to cover its minimal faults. I again cant exactly point at any specific pros/cons of the DSG (Lack of experience). Just one point as I mentioned above. If you use the paddles on the DSG, the manual mode doesnt revert back to auto on its own. It stays in manual till you force it back to auto. Also ,reliability wise we need to get the maximum warranty and be mentally prepared for a gearbox failure at some point. End of the day, I think your choice should come down to how you drive. Do you like revving the engine and keeping the pots on boil or are you a sedate driver who keeps the revs low. In a nutshell; The 1.5 TSI can be revved The 1.0 TSI needs to be revved Cheers.", 6th February 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,64,127

So with paddles or when I use a stick to go manual, if the engine revs fall below a threshold the gear is moved down and car automatically goes into Auto. I need to use the stick once again to go manual.

1093, cvkone1 , 18:28 ,Newbie,"Hello BHPians, First things first, this is my first writeup on Team BHP and I would like to receive constructive criticism and feedback on my writeup. First photo I took of the car after bringing it home. Likes: Engaging driving experience Punchy engine Fast responsive 6-speed torque converter transmission Paddle shifters which allow to make instantaneous gear shifts without moving the lever over to Manual (M) Clean and friendly UI on infotainment display Wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay and Wireless charger Ample leg and knee room in the second row Massive door storage compartments Four USB C fast charging ports Functional roof rails (not decorative plastic rails) Dislikes: Mileage plummets if you get a bit throttle happy Hard suspension can seem harsh on broken patches of road at low speeds Some plastics inside the cabin feel cheap Black body cladding (this is absent from the T-Cross sold elsewhere) Limited rear visibility through IRVM Marginally smaller boot compared to rivals Reversing camera quality could have been better Tiny cupholders in the center console Bump in the middle rear seat makes the ride comfortable for two but the middle passenger has to sit higher and doesnt get enough shoulder and head room. My Old Ride: Previously owned a Tata Indigo Manza Aura (Diesel) which was in our family for 12 years. It was not the best drivers car by a long shot but had a massive boot, ample leg room for everyone and a comfortable ride even though the Diesels drone was definitely audible inside the cabin. Even though it was an old Tata, ours was a gem and in its long lifespan we hardly faced any quality control issues, just small niggles here and there. In recent years though, it had started showing its age as the door hinges had started going loose, the dash rattled while idling etc. The mechanicals of the car were still sound. Old ride standing alongside the new ride Usage: Primarily highway usage with occasional city use. Needs to fit three full size suitcases so the boot needs to be big. Wanted a bit more ground clearance as the Manza used to scrape its bottom on the occasional village road rides. We live in Nagpur with our hometown just across the border in Madhya Pradesh near Gondia. The car would mostly travel between these two places with city driving sprinkled in between. There would also be some ambitious 1000km+ journeys here and there. Decision making process: As we wanted the car to have higher ground clearance than our old Manza and a big boot, we started looking at the crossover market. We were looking at the Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, Skoda Kushaq, VW Taigun and the Mahindra XUV700. First test drive: As the Taigun had just launched when we started looking and I was really doubtful and intrigued about a 1 liter 3-cylinder engine in a crossover, I requested a test drive for the same. 3-4 days later the sales rep brought a 1.0 AT car to our house which is in a gated community with closed roads. This gave us an opportunity to drive the car at its limit through the narrow roads and twisty turns of our society. The car handled beautifully with very little body roll and the steering also felt lively and gave good feedback. Also, to my utmost surprise I couldnt believe the car had a 1.0L 3-cylinder engine as it was so peppy and responsive. Safe to say the dynamics of the Taigun left a lasting memory in our minds. The positives of the dynamics outweighed the negatives like the cheap plastics inside the cabin etc. Second step: We went to the Kia showroom to have a look at the Seltos. We drove the 1.4L NA with the CVT. Coming fresh from the Taigun the Seltos didnt feel as engaging to drive. The car in no way felt dreary but you could definitely feel the car's height and weight when compared to the VW. Also, to my surprise the middle of the road HTK+ variant which we were looking at came with lesser functional equipment like wireless charger, wireless Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and type-C fast chargers. Third step: We went to the Mahindra showroom to have a look at the XUV700 AX5. In our minds we had almost finalized on the XUV700 looking at the brochures online and the glowing YouTube reviews of the car but our experience in the showroom was abysmal to say the least. The sales rep transferred us over to a trainee sales rep who showed us around the AX7L variant and refused to answer any questions regarding the differences between the variants. After his rote learnt tour of the car was over, he locked the car and walked away. We stood in the showroom for around 10 minutes and then decided to leave. After coming home on closer inspection, we learnt that the AX5 misses out on basic features like a reverse camera, cruise control, automatic AC to name a few. As we couldnt extend our budget to the AX7 variants we moved on. Fourth step: We visited the Hyundai dealership to have a look at the Creta. To our surprise the dealership didnt have any Creta units for us to test drive neither to have a look at. The sales rep directed our attention to the Alcazar as according to him its marginally expensive and offers a bigger boot (he himself admitted the third row isnt for adults but at least you get a bigger boot). But they didnt have an automatic Alcazar for test drive too and we just got a tour of a customer car which had come for its regular service. This definitely didnt help in our buying decision and it also showed us how Hyundai is struggling due to the chip shortage and high demand for their cars. Fifth step: We finally went to the Skoda dealership and were reminded of the utter driving joy the Taigun gave us in the Kushaq. Here we also got a chance to drive the 1.5L TSI engine which although is plenty noticeable when compared to the 1.0L, the price gap didnt feel that justified for us with the added cost of the DCT which comes mated to the 1.5L. After the bad experience at Mahindra and long waiting periods of the Korean siblings the VAG cars stood out for us in our price range. We were either looking at Kushaq Ambition AT or the Taigun Highline AT. The key difference in features between them was that the VW offered wireless charging whereas the Kushaq offered LED headlights. The Skoda also had some Simply Clever features like phone pockets, sunglass holders, parking ticket holders etc. which the Taigun missed out on but the Taigun guaranteed to come with many known Skoda problems (EPC issue, headliner and loose air vents) fixed. At the end having a transferrable job to any remote part of India made us choose the Taigun owing to VWs larger dealer and service networks. After almost a month of research we brought home this golden-yellow bundle of joyful driving on the 10th of December 2021. Our Taigun's epic 2314km maiden voyage: After a last-minute change in plans me and my family of four had to travel to Delhi from Nagpur. The flight prices had sky rocketed and trains didnt seem like a viable option due to the high number of corona cases. So, on the dawn of 27th of January 2022 we started our journey to New Delhi with the car having done a puny 844 city kms before this journey. Here are some photos from our roadtrip: On our first day we traveled from Nagpur to Delhi covering 1050kms with a travel time of 14 hours. The car was a joy to drive and all the passengers were comfortable as well. The majority of our journey was on well maintained four lane highways where the cruise control came in clutch. The car felt very stable and planted at 110kmph on the Yamuna expressway and was happy to navigate gradual turns on highways comfortably at triple digit speeds. The second leg of our journey was traveling from New Delhi to Jaipur to a relatives house. The highway connecting to Jaipur was filled with heavy trucks trying to overtake each other on a four-lane meaning the car didnt get to stretch its legs on this part of our journey. After a wonderful stay with our family, we headed back home from Jaipur to Nagpur covering 936 kms with an average of 68kmph. The lower average can be attributed to the road works going on in patches after Bhopal. The road was fantastic though and the car handled beautifully in the ghats. After this epic journey our car desperately needed a wash as the windshield and headlights were riddled with squashed bugs and the 16 rims covered in brake dust. We were able to achieve a mileage of 14kmpl which isnt great but also isnt terrible considering we were four adults with three full size suitcases in the boot carrying a pretty high average speed. The engine seemed really smooth and powerful throughout the journey. The transmission was quick in shifting gears and the paddle shifters really helped get an overtake done quickly by just shifting down and then the gearbox taking care of the upshift. All four of us were very comfortable in the car and had no complaints regarding comfort. The suspension did feel harsh on bad roads but the slight imperfections in the road on high speed are absorbed nicely. The car also didn't have it's door seals replaced so the doors did rattle but something I noticed was that this problem is more pronounced on lower speeds than highway speeds. Since then I've had them replaced and the problem has gone away. I'll be sharing updates regarding this in a future post in this thread. This has been my initial experience with the car and I wish to keep updating you guys. I will be coming up with the exterior, interior, technical review and my service experience shortly.", 11th February 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Nagpur,9,126

1096, PRS7 , 14:29 ,BHPian,"My new VW Taigun Dear all, Here's my review first post on this esteemed forum. This is a summary on my buying and short term ownership experience of the new VW Taigun GT Plus DSG. Car selection and finalization: Had been on the look out for a new car since March 2020 to replace my first car and trusted steed, a 2008 Wagon R Lxi Petrol in silky silver, which is still going strong and now chillaxing at my hometown in Thrissur, Kerala, after 13 plus years of trustworthy service (no breakdowns in her lifetime yet). Wanted to go for a performance compact SUV (my passion) with an automatic transmission (mandate from dear wifey) keeping in mind the highway runs from Hyderabad to Thrissur on vacations and also future tour programs pan India. Had finalized the 2020 Jeep Compass Longitude diesel AT and made the booking too. Sadly this was later called off due to Covid induced financial surprises. Come 2021, we still tried to go for the JC (facelift). This time the limited diesel AT. Once again it was put off due to various reasons of which the primary one being the price touching 33 lacs OTR. With a heavy heart decided to put a step back and go for the crowd favorite. The Creta diesel SX opt. Made the booking in Oct 2021. Time passed and lead time predictions extending every other week, started to get on our (Me and wifey) nerves. Also the thought of spending 21 big ones on a common car with undesirable safety credentials was lingering in the back of my head. Did not consider the Kushaq due to the problems reported at that time and also did not personally like the looks of it. Made enquiries for T-Roc in November, however I was late since the car went out of stock forever. Dealer then suggested me to have a look at the new Taigun. VW Taigun Went for a test drive for the GT plus 1.5 DSG. Absolutely loved the ride, handling and power on command of this beast, although some omissions like no ventilated seats, no electronic handbrake, were sore points, which I chose to ignore in a trade off for having a better engineered product at this price point, with some amount of ownership exclusivity. Went ahead and booked the curcuma yellow color as this was the most liked one by me and wifey. Although we liked the red too, but were put off by the red gloss dashboard in that variant. Got the delivery of the car in 2 days (yes you heard it right.) The car just rolled out of the factory and came straight to us at VW Hitech showroom at Hyderabad as understood from the VIN. The customary puja was done and we brought the beast home. Initial ownership observations The Taigun feels impressive with 1.5 DSG just powering through on demand with smooth handling. Suspension is stiff on bad patches. Cabin insulation is quite good. Audio setup leaves a lot to be desired if you are into refined music experience. For me it is good enough. Infotainment system meets expectation with Apple carplay working without fuss each time I turn on the ignition. Coming to the most important question ""kitna deti hai"" The Taigun returns an impressive 12 to 13 Kmpl in Hyderabad city runs on average speeds at 25 to 30 KMPH. The ACT is seldom called in to action due to constant braking needed due to DJs (diagonal jackass - one who cuts diagonally across from one side of the road to the other in front of you without warning) Was not able to stretch its legs on a Highway run yet, so cannot comment on the mileage returned at higher speeds. However, I feel it will be significantly higher due to ACT combined with cruise control. I will surely update on that through my upcoming travelogues with this yellow beauty.", 14th February 2022,volkswagen-taigun,TS15/KL08,29,108

1105, throttleflick , 01:57 ,BHPian,"I've recently completed 1000kms on the odo. My Dominar is called Vladimir while I decided on Akula for the Taigun. Both these names are spoken in my mind, my mother makes fun of me when I address these vehicles by their given names. She completely relates to the ""My mom asked me to carry a potted plant with me at all times to compensate for the amount of oxygen I waste"" meme and keeps poking fun at me for naming my vehicles. Swagat service experience I completed a month of ownership on the 9th of Feb and the service center folks at VW Nerul wanted me to drop by for the Swagat Service. The ODO was around 864km when I went in. I reached the service center around 10:30 in the morning and the car was taken in 15 mins later. Service advisor asked me to get the car disinfected before taking the car in. He also told me that they'd be disinfecting the car before delivery. I thought this might be in line with the COVID protocols VW might have setup for the service centers and asked him if this was a part of the free service itself. To which, the SA told me I'd be charged 1.4k for this. I tried to bail out of this but he insisted that this was mandatory. My sales advisor was on leave but was kind enough to pick up my call and tend to the enquiry about the mandatory disinfection. He said it's a month old car and I don't really require the disinfection. A quick call to bhpian thisissoumya also cleared my doubts about the disinfection. I told the SA that I won't be paying for the disinfection and they better not do it. He obliged to the request. The SA took no initiative to explain what would be checked during this free service. Upon asking, he told me that they'd check the fluid levels, connect the VCDS to check for errors if any, clean the car and deliver it to me. All of this would take about 2-3 hours. A copy of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban kept me occupied while the service folks did (or didn't do) their job. Oh I informed the SA that I was facing door squeaks when the car was in motion, particularly over speed breakers. This was resolved by the service folks by applying some silicon lubricant. The service center was facing some glitches in their billing software and network so I was given the receipt over email, while a handwritten receipt was given as a gate pass for the security to let me take the car. I've always had a bad experience with servicing my vehicles. Bajaj ruined it for me with their Lower Parel, Thane and their long shut Borivali A.S.S. I didn't have high hopes with the VW service to begin with and, I wasn't proven wrong. I was handed the keys to a washed car with water marks on the windshield, windows and ORVMs around 3:15, asked them to clean it properly. Wheels weren't as clean but they did end up polishing the tyres. The SA wasn't aware about the Swagat kit, his superior asked me to give the same. This kit contains a shampoo and windshield washer fluid. I waited in the customer lounge for about 4 hours to get these checks done. The buying experience was exceptional for me, but the service experience was sub-par. Can't thank bhpian thisissoumya enough for recommending the VW Autobahn dealership in Nerul. Blacked out roof: I always had plans to get the roof wrapped in black. This was my plan with the Polo and I thought that the Taigun would look cool as well with a black roof. Currently, only the GT variants get the roof (painted?) in Carbon Grey. SA had arranged this for me on the swagat service day itself and, I took the car to the dealership and got the roof wrap done by them. Took around an hour and I'm happy with the way it looks. Owning the Taigun 1.0 AT. After spending more than a month with the Taigun and completing 1k, I finally was able to enjoy the 1.0 TSi. Floor the pedal and the car just pulls like it's trying to escape dementors. Audible scraping noise after slowly going over a potholed road: One incidence managed to scare me a little on my drive to Sula vineyards where, after negotiating a potholed road just outside Sula, there was an audible sound of something scraping coming from the front wheel. I parked the car, turned the steering to left and right and checked if I'd hit something. There wasn't anything fishy although, I was quite concerned about the sound popping up again on my return journey to Thane. It put a dampener to the Sula experience and I was eager to get back to the car and check if it made the sound. I was thoroughly relieved to hear nothing but my water bottle rubbing against the bottle holder. Engine cranks but won't turn: I've faced an issue for a total of three times till now where, after pressing the start button and brake pedal, the car keeps cranking for a while. I then have to press the start button again with the brake pedal and then the engine turns on. These three instances happened during cold starts. Fuel and fuel efficiency: I've been driving the car in and around Thane. The ODO reported fuel consumption on one instance was 15.6km/l but I'm sure I've been getting around 12-13km/l for a mixed of highway and city driving. Upon delivery, I'd topped off the tank with XTRA Premium but switched to XP95 for subsequent tank fills. I'm happy with the way the car drives on XP95. The accelerator input feels so good that I have to exercise control over the foot to not rev harder. You can see bhpian thisissoumya's Lapiz Blue Polo HL MT in the below picture. Drive comfort: is okayish I think. As a driver though, I haven't found a perfect driving position. That is something that bothers me on long drives. And these 250km round way drives aren't exactly long either, so it makes me question how comfortable will I be on 500km + drives. My lower back starts hurting after a while, I constantly end up adjusting my posture while driving and my bottom aches as well. All that, and it kinda bothers me that my left leg is left with nothing to do than just hang around and chill. Nevertheless, I'm glad I added a car and not a cruiser to my garage. Creature comforts: Air con somehow is a bone of contention for most of potential buyers and I've found myself sufficiently pampered in the car with the AC set to auto and the temperature set between 20 and 24. I love the ventilated seats. I absolutely love them. My mother who is the primary passenger loves this feature as well. The hand rest extends towards the dashboard and provides ample surface to rest my elbow. The space underneath the hand rest could have been better though. I find the inclusion of two usb c ports useful for charging up my phone. I also keep using the wireless charger quite a lot. It's not the fastest wireless charger but I'm happy with it regardless. Apple car play is another great feature inclusion. It does disconnect after a while, although I suspect this only happens when I'm traversing through one specific location in Thane. Not sure if this is network related or software. Haven't installed the inbuilt apps as Apple Carplay has everything I need from the ICE system. My audio expectations are also catered to properly with the speakers blasting decent sound if I have to mute my mother rant about me and let Kishore Kumar or Agnes Obel take over. The My VW Connect app is crap. No point wasting words talking about it. Oh the ORVMs. They are a tad disappointing with the amount of area they cover. I asked my sales advisor if they could upsize it to the ones which come standard on the Tiguan and I kinda knew he'd say no. Using them while making a u-turn induces fear inside me and I have to crane my neck to double check for bikes. There have been incidences where a biker has apparated next to me and I've had no clue about them being next to my car. Right hand rear view is still fine, the left side is the most concerning. If the front seat is occupied, it becomes a bit difficult to check on the oncoming traffic while making u-turns at traffic signals. Reversing camera is sub par. But I'm kinda glad it is there as a standard fitment. I've had no reversing camera on our 2007 Toyota Innova and thus, I rarely glance over the ones on the Taigun while backing up in my parking slot. I kept checking the owners manual to finally conclude that there is no trip meter on the digital cockpit. The digital cockpit feels incomplete. They've wasted so much space at the either side of the display. All the service and car status icons could have taken up that space elegantly and left the display with some space to add a trip counter which is far more intuitive than the way they've chosen to display that bit of info. I don't want to shift focus on the ICE and check the vehicle status. For the way I've been built, with short arms and all, I find navigating the ICE to be a task. Same for the horn pad. I'm used to not taking off my fingers from the horn pad on the Innova and I crave for that experience here as well. The buttons to navigate the digital cockpit are also bleh. Purely in terms of how they're arranged and the functions they cater to, the implementation could have been better. I wish they had a call accept/reject button on the steering wheel. The cruise control placement however, I love it. Again, operating it isn't as intuitive to me, but I like the controls placed on the steering wheel rather than on the headlight stalk. The auto dimming rear view mirror is such a nice feature to use. I don't think I'll ever be able to figure out how to use the TPMS. Let's just leave it at that. Touchpoints: In car: For the amount of money they've charged, I wish they gave good arm rest padding on the door. The mirror adjustment controls feel flimsy. I couldn't figure out how to fold the ORVMs when I'm at a traffic signal and want to let a biker pass. I was convinced that this doesn't work on my car and it is broken, although again, after a quick chat with bhpian thisissoumya, I discovered that I had to twist the knob 180degs to fold them. I feel I'll break the knob sooner than it's supposed to give up. The one touch driver window down operation feels faulty to me. I touch the button to roll the driver window and intervene when it's rolled to the desired state, and when I want to roll it up, it keeps rolling down till the system realizes that I've been wanting to roll it up. I've rarely noticed the blanks flanking on either side of the hazard indicator switch. I frequently use the ventilated seats yet somehow, I haven't found the blanks to be an eyesore. The touch controls are very sensitive to touch and prone to reacting to accidental inputs. And it is such a chore and a hazard to operate them cuz I have to keep taking my eyes off the road to adjust the air flow. On the roof liner, they could have just gone ahead and added a sunglass holder. Not that I notice it during the drive, but it kinda bothers me before and after the drive while operating the sunroof. The buttons to illuminate the cabin were pathetic and this was something I made peace with when I decided that I would ditch my Polo booking in favour of the Taigun. Outside car: I've no clue why they've given a boot release button on the key fob. When the car is locked and it senses my presence, pressing on the boot release on the door opens the boot while the car is still locked. I thought this must be a fault so I shut the boot, kept the key fob outside of the cars range and then tried to open the boot. To my relief, it remained locked. Ever since, I think of this as a feature than a fault. The request sensors on both sides of the front doors are a nice touch. For the first time, my hands have been full with objects that aren't my car keys and yet, I've been able to enter the car. Expectations: I'd want to get rid of the 80km warning chime. I would also love to increase the count of touch turn signals from 3 to 5. I wish there was a way to reprogram that blank button on the driver to do something. And I wish that button could be programmed to horn or bring back Severus Snape, Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. From the time I thought I should get a car, to the time I went ahead and booked one, I always knew it had to be a VW Polo. I never checked any other car on the market. Cars owned by my friends from the Hyundai stable didn't inspire me as much. So I've cocooned myself from the features that are standard equipment on the cars that are from this segment. I'm happy with the equipment that came with this car. Heck, I was happy with what VW is offering on the HL+ AT as well. A safe drive with comfortable journeys was something I wanted for my mom and me and the Taigun has kept us happy on that front. It obviously doesn't have the thrill a cruiser ride would have, but given my moms age and my tolerance for a heavy bike plus a pillion rider and a tank bag, and the way our roads are, I'm glad I added a car to the garage.

I initially thought of fitting my existing bluskysea B1w dashcam in a cousin's car and getting the blaupunkt available at VW, but that was quite expensive and looked very bulky, so for now thought of using my dashcam itself. When I went to the showroom/service station to get the number plate fitted, i requested them to get the wiring into the trim and dashboard panels in a way that I can use the 12V socket in front of the gear lever as the power source, but their electrician and chief mechanic told its not possible since it's a single panel dashboard and that the trim over the A pillar cannot be disassembled. Following this I visited my go to car accessory guy at Mysore, one Mr. Gurumurthy who owns this place called Car cosmetics near Bamboo Bazar, Bannimantap. He was the one who had done the same work on my Nios earlier. He routed the wire into the gear boot, then removed the glove box lid, routed the wire behind the dashboard on the front passenger side, here using plastic tags he secured the wire at two places, then got the wire into the trim panel on the frame adjacent to the door sill, then upwards and into the A pillar trim, and finally into the roof liner. I was busy helping him out and failed to take pics of the work, but will attach how it looks now. He did this by making a loop on one end of a stiff steel wire of about 3mm thickness and securing the USB type B end to the loop, then he passed the wire through crevices and pulled through the wire across the dashboard and various trim panels. Itvwas very much like the suture/wire passer we orthopaedicians use in some surgeries. But then there still is a small issue. The power to the 12V socket remains switched ON even when the car is not running and the car is locked. So for now I have to remember to disconnect the power supply after every drive, so I'm going to request VW service to make modifications to disconnect the power supply once the engine is shut. Second problem is that everytime the power supply is removed, the date and time of my dashcam has to be reset. This was solved with connecting via WiFi; now the date and time get adjusted to that of the phone, but the wireless Android Auto keeps disconnecting ever since connecting to the dashcam. So now I've disabled date and time stamp on the dashcam settings and removed the WiFi network of the dashcam from the phone. Found an alternative for this issue - We can use the onboard apps like sygic for navigation and Gaana for music, and connect the phone through Bluetooth for calls and use the mobile hotspot to provide WiFi for the ICE, but this option drains battery on the mobile like crazy. So I'm planning to get a WiFi dongle for the car alone. Will update how that goes later. Attaching pics of how the dashcam looks now in our Taigun. P.S.: I did not want to hardwire the dashcam since even VW doesn't hardwire the blaupunkt dashcam available as part of their accesories. ", 20th February 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Mysore,108,421

Biggest reason would be the comfort that an AT gearbox provides. You can trust the car to choose the best gear most of the time. And of-course it is an absolute life saver in bumper to bumper traffic in metros. Given the 1.0 comes with a TC gearbox AND paddle shifters - You would get peace of mind in terms of gearbox (Unlike DSG) and you'll still get to be more involved, just like a MT.", 20th February 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Gurgaon,20,28

The engine is eager and makes me want to floor the pedal. The only downside I've found on the AT is the lack of control that the MT gives. I try using the pedals on the steering to downshift and regain control when the car is on a slope. I took as many test drives as I could to choose between the 1.5 DSG and the 1.0 AT before finally settling down on the 1.0 AT. The accessories are good quality. I opted for them because I didn't want to go outside the dealer for the mud flaps and floor mats. They look good, I've still not removed the paper mats that come from the service center. Check if you can opt for the mud flaps individually as you can get those installed by the dealer itself and, get a good quality replacements cheaper from accessories shops.

Then I came to realise that the Blaupunkt has a rechargeable battery so we need to plug it in only when charging and then it can be disconnected. So I'm assuming the date and time don't reset as well. VW mysore has the previous gen Blaupunkt 3.0 FHD dashcam retailing at Rs. 9600. On gomechanic the next gen 4.0 FHD cam with detachable interior cam is available at a discounted price for Rs. 5399. I guess I'll either go for this or any other cam with battery back-up after a few months. I'm really happy with my current dashcam, I've had absolutely no issues with the blueskysea B1W for the past 4 years. There is one disadvantage - the mic is not great and audio quality is poor so I've disabled audio. Attaching a screen recordings from the videos (unable be attach the videos) showing the quality in the morning as well as at night during a thunderstorm (caught a lightening strike as well). But DDPai and 70Mai at comparable prices seem like better options right now. The only disadvantage of dashcams with in-built battery IMO is that they are bulky and have to be placed much lower on the windshield, I prefer not to have anything mounted at the center of the windshield. At night I remove the power cable properly since there is this obvious blue indicator light on it, but in the morning I'm forgetting to remove it, so now I've put a post-it on the door near the handle reminding me to remove the power cable for the dashcam.

For the way I've been built, with short arms and all, I find navigating the ICE to be a task. Same for the horn pad. I'm used to not taking off my fingers from the horn pad on the Innova and I crave for that experience here as well. The buttons to navigate the digital cockpit are also bleh. Purely in terms of how they're arranged and the functions they cater to, the implementation could have been better. I wish they had a call accept/reject button on the steering wheel. I don't think I'll ever be able to figure out how to use the TPMS. Let's just leave it at that. The VW Connect App is perhaps a half hearted attempt to try and give some connected car functionality and this attempt began with the VW dongle they offered me for free with our Polo in 2020. I didn't use it for more than a day, and it was so bad and buggy that I couldn't even consider recommending or reselling it. Even on our Tiguan, there isn't a dedicated Call Accept Button, but I believe you would be able to Accept and Reject calls using the Up-Down directional buttons on the right, since I can do that on our Tiguan with a similar set of buttons. If you get an incoming call notification on your instrument cluster, then you can hit OK to Accept or use the Up-Down keys to cycle to Reject and then hit OK to reject your call. Please try this out and hopefully it should work, unless calls aren't relayed to your Instrument Cluster and stay on the Infotainment system. I have a strong feeling it should work. The TPMS on the Taigun is an Indirect TPMS and frankly there isn't much to do with it. When there is a pressure drop, the vehicle should detect a reduction in a particular wheel speed and provide you a Low Pressure or drop in pressure warning depending on its calculation from a learned reference pattern. From your Infotainment System, you can head to Settings > Car > Tyres and hit SET when pressures have been checked. That's all you have to do and the ABS controller should do the rest of the backend learning pattern and hopefully it will work as expected. I have used this feature plenty of times on our Polo and MK5 Jetta and it does work well once the learning pattern has been done. On your Taigun, it should also work in a similar way.

Thanks for the suggestions fludicjoy, I think the call accept/reject experience is a bummer for me solely because I use Apple CarPlay and the ICE takes over. I've never noticed the incoming call notification appear on the instrument cluster when connected to CarPlay and I'm going to keep an eye on it. It does appear when not connected I guess because I remember using it at least on one instance. Regarding the TPMS, I followed what the owners manual said on day 1, your explanation makes much more sense in addition to what VW has mentioned in it. Thanks for clearing this up. Cheers.

The 3M guys even claimed the AC usage would go down but I did not notice any difference to before. The biggest problem is driving at night on dimly lit roads and in rains. As the warm lamps on our roads are not bright and the portion of that insufficient light is absorbed by the film you have less visibility. A few days after I installed the film I used to stop the car to get down and check if my headlights were working or not during night drives. The only solution for me is to either get rid of the film which I am loathe to do as I had spent ~10k on it or upgrade the headlights to HID/LED, which will void the warranty as per FORD ASS .", 22nd February 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Hyderabad,23,92

Also, will you be getting it done for the entire glass area of the car or just the windshield and rear glass? Hi Throttleflick. I'll share the experience I had with the sunfilm on the nios. I had the sunfilm by Garware on the nios and i absolutely loved it. 30% tint film (this is almost transparent) for the front and rear windshield, 70% tint for the windows. This was quite effective, only sore point last time was the Garware branding which was visible making me prone to getting stopped in other states, also 70% was a tad too dark, got fined on one instance at Goa too. I told the my accesories shop guy to make sure that the branding area is not stuck onto the glass. Will opt for the 30% for the windshields and 50-60% for the windows, mostly 50%. Already I've planned a couple of road trips for this year, one from Mysore-Secunderabad next month and the other from Mysore to Delhi this year end, don't want to end up paying heavy fine across the country. I'm getting the sunfilms on Saturday, will share the pics. Sharing pics of the sunfilms on the nios. Cost for the 4 windows Rs. 1800 Cost for the 2 windshields Rs. 1800 Another reason is for the increased privacy considering my wife and me get a fair bit of late night hospital calls and drive at night times a lot, sometimes alone too. As far as night time visibility is concerned, i had no issues with the nios at all, most of my road trips were done with longer duration and distance at night time (predominantly ghat sections), and I've never had visibility issues, in fact I felt the glare was lesser. IMO the headlight brightness and throw is better in Taigun than the Nios, to the extent that Taigun is the only vehicle I've driven so far in which I haven't found the need to use the fog lamps for better visibility without a foggy situation. So i feel visibility might not be hampered.", 23rd February 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Mysore,108,421

Pray I dont alter it any further. From the owners manual, Quote: Adjustable speed limit The system offers the possibility to set a speed limit beyond which an acoustic warning signal will sound and the following warning message appears in the display of the instrument cluster. Preset speed limit 80 km/h and 120 km/h Only applies to some countries due to country-specific legal requirements. The system automatically alerts you when you are exceeding the speed limit of 80 km/h and 120 km/h. If the speed exceeds 80 km/h, an audible warning signal will sound and the symbol will appear in the display. The audible warning sounds at regular intervals of two minutes until the speed is reduced. It the speed exceeds 120 km/h, an audible warning signal will sound and the symbol will appear in the display. They've also mentioned steps to be able to set the speed limit, but I've not found them in the 10"" screen or the digital cockpit. I think we can't set the speed at which the car will sound the chime as the laws here mandate the 80 km/hr and 120 km/hr chime. I've gotten used to the 80km/hr chime although, it does get fairly irritating when I'm constantly crossing that threshold after having to slow down and speed up again. I would've loved to set it at 100 km/hr. Would be so cool to see the pictures and ownership on a Carbon Grey Taigun.

1132, dailydriver , 18:30 ,Senior - BHPian,"Test drove the 1.5 TSI GT on behalf of a friend today. Below are my observations: WHAT I LIKE 1. Drives really well - difficult to wipe the grin off the face once you get hang of the automatic. 2. Quick shifting, barely noticeable gears. Manual mode using paddle shifts adds an altogether different dimension to the drive. Sport mode is the icing on the cake (revving the engine in lower gears does give rise to a harsh note though). 3. Brakes are good. Sudden stops as well as gradual deceleration gave no cause for worry. 4. Ride is compliant and the handling competent. Potholes are dismissed with disdain although one does feel the road surface a bit. 5. Front seats are supportive; sufficient width and depth on the seating surface and enough bolstering on the back rest. But I am a 5.5 ft, lean built gent and therefore my perception could be subjective. 6. Rear seats are spacious and can seat three average built men without much trouble. But the middle seat is, as usual, a bit uncomfortable; the width of the transmission tunnel providing the guidelines for placing the two legs of the occupant. 7. Legroom is generous. 8. MID & ICE look nice. WHAT IRKS ME 1. Quality of the seat cover, headliner, dashboard, certain switches and door pad plastics remind me of much much cheaper cars. The roof feels hollow - as found using the tap test. 2. Boot space could have been more. High loading lip makes placing luggage difficult. 3. Priced at around 20 big ones, the car does feel a bit overpriced by at least 2-3 lahs. But so do many others in the segment. Hence, can't do much here. MISC 1. Looks are subjective; I certainly didn't like it. It lacks a distinct identity and character 2. Couldn't explore the ICE, MID and sunroof in detail. I missed noticing the FE display too. 3. The SA insisted that the DSG is an improved, India ready variant and therefore chances of failure are minimal. In the same breath, he also suggested we go for maximum warranty - just for peace of mind . x x x As the friend isn't keen on spending 20 lakhs on a new car and since he can manage easily without the automatic, we are looking to test drive the 1.0 manual.

I am not putting the delivery ceremony pics since they kinda are overdone, but there I could nt complain. Very personalised. Almost booked the Polo again too, till i got a nudge from the wife !! Initial experience. The knobs, plastics, dashboard, body build is not what their initial offerings were. Even the rotation of the headlight control knob is so not VW as isn't the adjustable side view mirror knob or the window up/down buttons. Even, the folding key weighs half of what the Polo key does. So they have seriously scaled their own on quality to cut costs. But, still superior to all except the MG Astor about which I had written earlier in Nov during the test drive spree. An observation, just sometime before dusk, whilst it's bright enough outside the instrument cluster being shaded is dark, so one has to strain to see the readouts barring the speedo and rpm needle (AT, High line). NOW, unlike all cars, here, switching on your parking lights won't light up the instrument cluster. One has to switch on the headlights when they aren't actually needed) for the cluster to be lit up. I thought I had missed something,so-called up the GM. He said that it's a design thing since he drives the same model. This is something that got my goat and i intend to write to VW about making a software tweak to remove this. The 80kmph chime! Pain. The dealership says they can't (?) do it, but if done as an outside fix, the warranty won't be affected. Advice please for NCR region.

This is literally the most common thing in the world for Seltos, Creta, etc. YouTube is full of videos of base model upgraded to top model with OEM assemblies of headlights. I think you'll need to wait till the local market picks up the OEM parts. Most definitely the dealer wont do this. But do balance this out with your need for warranty, etc. VAG dealerships are famous for being finicky about these things for killing your warranty cover. Koreans have traditionally been more open.

Normally on 3rd gear. 2.Instrument Cluster lights- They go off in underground parking. Have already posted about this. 3. Body metal is much lighter than erstwhile VW products. 4. Interiors plastics are lower quality compared to VW standards. 5. Doors somehow need a push to close. No the light handed closing action am used to on the Polo TDi. 6. The trip meter doesn't seem to reset for each trip. If I don't re set it, it shows cumulative km run on the right hand bottom since the last trip reset button. 7. Each time I touch the brake pedal and push it about 1/2 an inch there is some kind of feedback on the gear knob. It's like a gentle throb inside the knob. One has to be holding the knob to sense this. 8. Throaty sound of the engine is quite 'nawice'! and it doesn't feel like a three cylinder (I dislike using the word pot for a cylinder in an engine. Find it kind of disrespectful). 9. The sliding forward function in the front arm rest is a nice touch. 10. The car has a tendency to drive in D2 when a third gear can easily do the job, so the paddle shift at such times is handy to slide her into M3. Downshifting wise, she doesn't have a problem. Eager to please. 11. Used the cruise control function at 50 when i got a reasonable stretch, just to test it within the city. Full maza (fun). 12. I hope all the alloy rimmed owners of the Taigun are aware of the lock placed on the rim nuts and how to unlock/remove the former. 13. Am using standard petrol (not speed). Will speed fuel help? 14. The steering wheel is too smooth to hold. Hands tend to slip. Some amount of rough finish would have been better. Quote: Originally Posted by throttleflick Congratulations man!

Post discussions he added that the tech team would be in touch. Got a call from the tech guy and it was also explained to him that if the instrument cluster lights are ON during day time by default, there is no reason for them to go OFF in low light conditions when the ambient light is still good enough (ambient lighting was shown on video). Thence, the need to switch on headlamps, to light up the instrument cluster lights is un warranted and results in unnecessary battery usage whilst also eating into headlamp bulb life. He asked me to send a video of the same, which was done. Suggested the following solutions:- 1. Tweak the software to let them be ON at all times,as an option for the customer in a service visit. 2. Tweak the software so that switching to PARKING LIGHT mode gets the instrument cluster lights ON. They said they would take this up and revert.

That's why I asked the previous question on whether someone has used Proctane Evo or STP or any other octane booster with the VAG TSI engines. Carrying a couple of bottles of it might be a blessing when XP95 or any higher RON fuel is not available in the vicinity.

Any thoughts, guidance from the experts/Taigun owners who have installed dashcams in their vehicles on this? Finally, the post that I wanted to make for a month and yet couldn't get to. I had ordered the DDPAI Z40 from Amazon on Feb 13th and received it the next day. It took me 2 to 3 days before I could get around to installing it but it was done just a couple of days before my trip to Vellore. The installation itself was quite simple and straightforward. What was not straight was my body during the process. Step 1: Found a nice spot right below the Fastag, stuck the static sticker, then exposed the 3M adhesive surface, aligned the camera and voila! It was done. Step 2: The wiring. The camera package comes with a more than sufficient length of USB cable. Started from the top, used the plastic tool to push the wire underneath the roof lining, all the way to the left side. Then, got the wire out towards the door, where I pushed it under the weather stripping all the way down until the glove box. I thought I could take the wire beneath and behind the glove box but couldn't really find a place to hold the wire. I also lacked the foresight to get a couple of cable ties. So, I somehow managed to stick the wire on the panel to the left of the center console and did some improvisation to hold the USB end using the power adapter. I didn't want to hard-wire it, so this arrangement works fine! It doesn't look too out of place and I just need to remember plugging in/out at the beginning/ending of each trip. One thing I discovered is this power outlet doesn't really cut off when the car is stopped and engine is turned off. It was recording for the entire time the car was parked at my relative's place in Vellore (few hours) and I didn't realize it until I took the SD card out and downloaded the videos. Here's how it looks from the outside, looking from the side. Here is the video clip that I uploaded on to YT. This will give you an idea of the clarity of the camera in daylight operation. https://youtu.be/af6W5ipDq8M It may not be the best installation, but there is a bit of satisfaction in doing it myself! I will see if I record something during low light or night time drives and post the videos in my ownership review thread! About the dashcam itself, a few thoughts. What I liked: Neat packaging, Quite simple to install. At the highest setting, very good clarity in videos Not too conspicuous. Size is pretty compact than what is shown on the product pages in Amazon. The camera can be detached from it's holder which is stuck to the windshield. Option to mute the microphone. It was quite good and captured really well some of my rants in the initial runs. Hence muted. What I didn't like: Removing the camera from the holder is a breeze. Putting it back in - I am yet to get the knack to do it smoothly. For some reason, downloading videos from the camera to my phone app via the inbuilt Wi-Fi doesn't seem to work properly. It downloads the whole 3 min video clip but I can't see it in the local folder section of the app. The clips in the SD are saved as 1min long clips. And at the highest resolution, each clip is 140MB in size. Transferring all the clips from the SD card to my laptop took a long time.

There is a significant improvement in cooling levels when moving from Auto mode to manual. Wanted the communities observations as well, if they have found similar trends. Hello All, I managed to get a good route to test the above hypothesis last weekend. I kept the temperature set at 23C and used Auto mode for first half of the trip and then used 23C with manual mode and fan set at L2. I opted to use the morning window when the traffic and signals are not particularly high. Also, temperatures are manageable. I used the same route to travel onwards and back to avoid any difference arising out of the road, elevation, etc. Lastly i tried to keep the speed and driving style controlled and avoided any sudden accelerations to avoid its impact on the FE. Please find the two snapshots, one taken midway of the drive and second on the trip end. One difference was that i had one additional person while travelling till midway. Overall observations as per the attached information is that if temperature is kept same and blower is not working too hard the FE drop is not present. Rather due to some other factor i am not sure which one, i got better efficiency on the return. For the next step i will have to try this during peak temperature time to understand the difference more accurately. Adding to the other topic on fuel. A good quality fuel is surely returning me better performance overall when compared with regular fuel.

1229, adigup , 14:01 ,BHPian,"Hey all, this is my first long/formal post on Team-BHP. My membership got approved on the same day we got the Taigun. It's the 1.0 TSi Manual, Highline. Having done 500kms in less than a week, here are a few observations and pictures I would like to share. Accessories bought from VW Mudflaps Seat Covers (like they have on Topline) All weather mats (they were trying to sell me the basic kit, but I escalated the matter, and it just got worse, but later, everything was sorted and they offered me individual accesories) Initial Observations: Absolutely love the way it handles (upgrading/changing from a Kia Seltos 1.5 NA Petrol) The engine doesn't feel like a 1.0 L unit at all during regular drives. It feels weak when you're too lazy to drop a gear in city conditions. and thus, forces you to downshift. Everyone in my house feels that the passenger seat is placed too low. The car we got is 2022 manufactured and so, the quality of roof-liner feels slightly better than the Test-drive car. (Having owned a Vento from 2012-2019, I agree some materials/switches don't feel as good, for ex. the sun visor feels flimsy and very light) Though the Infotainment is a little complex, it feels good to use. The speakers have good bass and I am quite happy with the sound quality. The halogen headlamps are AMAZING. (Better than the 5th gen City and the Seltos' halogens; I thought I was spoiled by the LED projectors on my Innova Crysta and Corolla Altis) Most importantly, my mother and sister don't feel the body roll, so I can corner (on empty roads) spiritedly. VW Connect is very useless. Honda Connect is better and more informative. Out of all the cars ever driven, the Corolla Altis CVT 2019 used to be my favourite daily drive; but since this car has come, I try to get my hands on it. (I still love you, Corolla. I swear it's the initial obsession with the Turbo) The ride is amazing. Farzi (my dog) only used to enjoy the Innova or the front seat of the Corolla. But looks like the scooped out/well-shaped seats of the Taigun are comfortable for him. (He braces himself well when the Turbo kicks in) I have an iPhone 12 Mini which tends to move around and so the wireless charger always gets suspended. Though, it charges my parents' iPhone 13 Pro and 11 Pro decently. If not, at least the charge just stays where they are and prevents discharging. (I was thinking too highly of it) Things to be checked:The gear knob has a creaky/plasticy sound when changing gears. Like, there is a piece of plastic wrap underneath the leather, which feels annoying. The car has been pulling to the left by A LOT. Need to get it checked; as there is a lot of brake dust on the front wheels as well. (Note: the car hasn't been cleaned properly as the cleaning guy didn't turn up for a couple days and my dad/I took the car for a drive whenever he showed up) Handbrake feels weird at times; and doesn't engage as expected. I haven't heard much of door/rattle noise but will take care of that. Planned mods (Provided the warranty doesn't go for a toss)Retrofitting the electrically foldable ORVM's Windtone horns Lock/Unlock sound confirmation Speed alarms Volume to refuel AC fan display in AUTO mode Volume to refuel Driver side window up/down with remote Some pictures during the day: Interior Rear Front (Mini Tiguan? or a Tiguan Mini?) The best part: Oh also, I think it has a message for my parents every time the ignition is turned off: Having 497kms complete, I am just waiting one more week to go for/schedule a pick-drop service or the 'SWAGAT' maintenance as VW calls it. Will check with them about the mods/horn (if anything can go wrong with warranty). Most importantly, have to get the steering/alignment issue checked. Spoiled the whole mood. Apart from that, I love the car. When I drive I get something between 11-15kmpl. Whenever my dad drives, he's able to fetch around 15-19kms to one litre. (I also can't wait for the run-in period to get over, for some spirited driving and also experiencing the full potential of this beast.) Here's a snap which I took after he came back from a 40-50kms drive (50% Highway + 50% City). I'd like to end my post here. Since, this is my first post (as mentioned), apologies if I went wrong somewhere or violated any guidelines. Will post frequent updates. Thanks Aditya", 30th March 2022,volkswagen-taigun,DEL,123,465

In VW cars if this happens the one touch up/down won't work, the window may stop at intermittent position and the remote up and down feature on remote also won't work. Resetting the window power system is very simple. Hold the button at full top and full bottom position for full 5 seconds. This will reset the settings.

Took the delivery and went straight to Mandir for Puja. Had a Taigun Highline AT in front of ours! Well, not all things end well. The very next day driver's side window refused to roll down. Tried multiple times, and it rolled down and stopped mid-way. I was surprised and disappointed as to what went wrong. Took the car to the service center and they diagnosed it with a faulty window winder motor. Anyways, they have put the order for the part and would receive it within 3-5 business days. Meanwhile, they closed the window and advised me to not roll down. I'm okay with the issue as it could definitely be a manufacturing defect and the service guys completely accepted it and handled the situation very professionally.

The mechanical rear wiper is definitely an eyesore! always wanted to change it with The frameless as in the polo, but had some complications. Let's start with the tools used; 1. Ratchet 2. Flathead screwdriver. Opened the cap and unscrew the nut. Was very tight inside, used a flathead screwdriver and from the sides pushed it outwards carefully by not damaging or scratching the windshield. Now comes the tricky part. This wiper's blade is a bit too big and thus stucks at the center position of the spoiler. I first thought of cutting the excessive part but that would end up looking different so used my jugadu brain and with very difficulty opened up the center part of the wiper blade(The one which gets attached to the wiper arm). Moved it a few cms to the right side of the blade so that the left side can go into the wiper arm. Used Mighty bond instant adhesive to stick the plastic part again and voila, it worked!

1282, PRS7 , 11:07 ,BHPian,"Long drive experience on the Taigun 1.5 GT TSI dsg plus a quick trip blog. Recently I did a drive from Hyderabad to Thrissur in my Taigun. The following are some of my observations about the vehicle and what new buyers could look forward to when they lay their hands on one. Will quickly mention other aspects of the trip that may interest some members. Started the drive from Hyderabad at around 6AM with a tank filled with 40l of normal petrol. Hit the ORR and quickly moved on to NH44 and continued onwards BLR through the usual route of Jadcherla > Kurnool > Anantapur > Chikballapur > Devanahalli. I took it steady with cruise control set at 90kmph during most stretches of this road. Though the car gave me confidence to cruise easily at 110 or 120, the frequent intersections on the highway, with it's uncomfortable rumble strips and precariously perched two wheelers, pedestrians waiting to dart in and out, gave me chills through out and I never dared to push it past 90. I found it stressful to go above 100 due to this. I have to say there was a certain thrill whenever I pressed the resume button on the cruise control after each intersection slow down, to see the beast roar back to 90 pushing all occupants to our seats firmly with a sly grin on our faces. I was sweltering all the way through as is expected in late April and the air conditioning was just effective. Ride comfort was excellent for all occupants and fatigue was minimal. Boot space was also quite adequate with space to spare. Stopped at Food pyramid Kothakota for breakfast and AP02 DINE IN Anantapur for lunch. Both were satisfactory, but nothing great to mention. Stayed at Aloft Whitefield for the night, which is a basic hotel of the Marriott group and I prefer it over others being a member and also due to the fact that it is relatively easier to skip the BLR traffic while coming in to it and also while leaving out the next morning driving into Hosur and onwards to Krishnagiri>Dharmapuri>Salem>Erode>CBE>Palakkad>Th rissur. Made sure to top up fuel in TN to take advantage of the lower prices. The difference is almost 7Rs per liter if you compare with Hyderabad. The average kilometreage (new term coined by me, excuse me if you find it silly ) achieved was 17.8 for the complete trip on an average speed of 65kmph. ACT worked perfectly while cruising and otherwise too but only on slopes and flats. The instantaneous returns were 30 to 35 kmpl whenever the car fired only on 2 cylinders. This has lead to me to the conclusion that this beast is a thoroughbred for the long haul on 6 lane divided carriageways. It doesn't quite like the city roads and expresses its discontentment by returning below 10kmpl at the hint of mediocre stretches and bumper to bumper traffic. On a side note, I unintentionally hurt the egos of some drivers of wannabe SUVs (you know what I mean) when they underestimated the VW beast and tried to overtake, much to their dismay then, found out that it was a difficult task Guess they will rejoice when and if I have a future DSG failure, which I pray to the almighty gods of the road may never come to be. Since it is still early days for the Taigun on Indian roads, it surely grabbed eye balls all throughout the journey and it was very pleasing to be honest. Looking forward to some memorable short trips within Kerala now. Cheers PRS7", 27th April 2022,volkswagen-taigun,TS15/KL08,29,108

1285, adigup , 13:42 ,BHPian,"3,000 kilometres / 40 days update: Managed to clock 3,000 kms (in close to 40 days) in my Taigun 1.0 Highline MT. The car has completed it's run-in period very well, I have managed to drive it on almost all sorts of conditions and therefore, here are my observations / experiences so far: I love the way it handles on high speeds. I have done good triple digit speeds and it did not feel like it. This engine is a dream.I know it feels better in the Vento and the Polo. (A friend owns 1.0 TSi AT Polo and have driven it). I think it does a good job on the Taigun as well, especially in the manual guise. (I have also driven a friend's 1.0 TSi AT Kushaq) It picks up pace without letting anyone know / feel - it's the beep at 80 kmph which reminds me to slow down. The turbo, gosh, let it kick in, and the car isn't just a Taigun anymore, it's like a therapy for me. Torque and clutch? The clutch is not that light but it's manageable. Half-way through releasing the clutch, the revs automatically go up to around 1,100 rpm to prevent stalling. Moreover, we usually park all our cars inside in the driveway - and to get into the gate, the ramp is quite inclined. While reversing into the driveway, this car just requires clutch and no accelerator input, the revs automatically go up to 1,300-1,400 rpm and help it climb up. (Just to mention, our Innova Crysta 2.7 AT has it's wheels skidding / slipping like crazy if there's no momentum or if we stop it midway on the ramp) Brakes are very good. The ABS kicks in at a good time whenever needed. Have panic / harshly braked like two times and they're quite confidence inspiring. (One time a friend was following in his car, and he saw the brake lights blink - one of the safety features) The car hates small / immediate potholes and it feels like a crime when that 'thudd' is heard. Otherwise, the road noise + drive on bad roads is fair. (The tire noise on this one is less than on my Corolla Altis 1.8 2019) While people call it outdated, I love the feeling of having a proper ignition + key fob combo. (No Push button start is what I mean) After 3 years, this just feels so old school and great! I hate technology sometimes. Plastic quality is definitely not great, but it feels okay. The gear lever creaking sound to which VW guys also admitted that it is a problem in all cars, hasn't been fixed yet. The car feels solid and a lot of people still turn to see it. (Looks like a mini Tiguan.) Recently, a silly Toyota Fortuner driver suddenly decided to move his car forward while my dad was reversing the Taigun out of a parking lot, we just got a mini inside bump on the bumper, and the towing hook cover - next to the reflector popped out, which we clipped back. The 2012 Fortuner's bumper popped out. I feel sad about it, we have two Toyotas, love them. The audio quality is amazing. I love every bit of it. Yes at some points, I feel it could be better but also think, tweaking the equaliser a little should do the job. Also, I don't know if it's the sun + heat or it's the screen which heats up. I also wish the Traction Control button was a physical button - probably should have been placed next to the Hazard lights button. The analogue speedometer feels amazing, it's a delight to watch the needles work. Also, love the fact that the speedometer lights dim whenever the car thinks / detects it's dark outside (to remind you to turn on headlights). Note: The car doesn't come with Automatic headlights. Also, the screen provides sufficient information and is quite customisable - like driving data, mobile phone data, and the song playing (and volume bar too). The halogen headlights work brilliantly well (and so does the cornering function). Better than the halogens of both - the Kia Seltos and the Honda City 2020 5th gen. I miss the power-folding ORVMs, VW guys have no clue when there will be a proper accessory or a fitment kit for it. VW OEM leatherette seat covers are great! Amazing fitting and they feel factory fitted. Whereas, Kia and Honda OEM seat covers definitely give a feel that they were installed like 5 years after the car was bought. The lighting and the whole setup (dashboard, interior colour, door handle illumination) feels premium, when you combine it with a VW logo and the performance, it just feels a segment above. There are no rattles, except for one. The driver's door - It only comes in light when there is a lot of bass coming out of the speakers or when the car is on an incline / uneven surface. It's not even prominent. The AC issue. Yes, it's an issue indeed. There is a whole thread going on about it. Link (Volkswagen Taigun : Ineffective air-conditioning) At this point, it's better to just keep waiting for a solution, and learn to live with it. As the car completed the run-in period, the behaviour surely changed, and now it's not throwing warm air as much, but there's still quite of it. Especially in slow moving traffic, but only when observed. I practice all habits like - Rolling windows down and letting the hot air exit (moreover, my parking is covered), making sure recirculation is turned on. Fuel efficiency (I use normal / unleaded petrol, all figures as per the car's system and with AC on at all times, 35% Highway + 65% City conditions) Note: COCO here is referring to Company Owner Company Operated Fuel Pump. Topped up from COCO. Minimum/Maximum: ~12.3 / ~15.6 kmpl Topped up from non - COCO. Minimum/Maximum: ~10.3 / ~12.9 kmpl ", 30th April 2022,volkswagen-taigun,DEL,123,465

To gain volumes, the group needs a presence below 10 lakhs mark, as the Polo has now been discontinued. Otherwise Skoda and VW may remain a niche player. Eventually we should expect stripped down variants of Slavia and Virtus as well, selling below 10 lakhs. I do expect a Slavia Rider to come at mouth watering price soon, just like the Rapid Rider launched earlier. The heavy investment made in MQB-A0 IN need to be recouped and this can be done only if the group is able to sell a good volume of cars.

1289, Atharva14 , 23:02 ,BHPian,"DIY: Upgrading to LED Turn indicators for Taigun! The tail-lights on the Taigun are really a masterpiece, I mean I love the way they light up at night! The LED strip looks classic. What definitely wasn't looking classic was the use of halogen bulbs in turn indicators. The assembly is huge but the space for turn indicators is small in it. I really think that the turn indicators would not be that clearly visible in daylight due to them being small and halogens! So it was a time for DIY! Searched youtube for the removal process of tail lights on Taigun but found none. Scared to do this on a month-old car, I finally plunged into it and gave it a shot! The tools used were the same as provided in the spare tire kit 1. A trim removal instrument 2. Screwdriver (Sorry, I don't know what type it is, but present in your spare tire kit) I'll let the pictures explain the process. Be really careful about the plastic trims not to break them while removing and installing The seal says, ""RETEST LAMP IF SEAL BROKEN"" and not warrant void if broken Removing the plastic trims to get into the bulb housing. Sorry, I literally Forgot to click pictures of the inside housing. That is a simple swap of bulbs though. LED Bulb type- BA15S P21W Bulbs sourced from- Durvient.com I was scared to see any error on the dash or hyper flashing of any indicator, but there was none.

An all LED setup always catches eyes during the night. Though some retro designs like old Japanese cars or RE bikes still do better with powerful halogen lamps just for that classier vibe.

These lights also perform poorly for me when someone with a powerful setup is behind me, the effect of my headlights gets cancelled and blends with the more powerful setup. I've always thought these LED headlights with the kinda temperature Dominar has to be a problem and the ones on the Taigun will inspire no confidence on that front. Good to have the fog lamps in an aesthetically out of sync color temperature. I've had my eyes tested and my doctor said I have a good vision. As long as I could see her, it was 6/6. When the roads are pitch dark, the throw from both the beams is amazing.

1301, adigup , 21:36 ,BHPian,"In the afternoon today, I got in my Taigun, turned the AC on and started driving immediately as I was in bit of a hurry. (The engine was relatively warm as I had come home for lunch while the car rested for 20 minutes). The car and infotainment usually takes it's own sweet time (~2 minutes) to boot and for the wireless Apple Carplay or the bluetooth to connect. This time as soon as the phone connected to my phone and the Carplay projection started, the screen turned green. I wasn't surprised as my dad had experienced this once before, and also once told me that screen turned off on it's own and became unresponsive for good two minutes. I ignored this problem, because after a few minutes, the screen starts to work fine. My dad complained to VW at the same time when we were having issues with the AC. ( linked here (Volkswagen Taigun : Ineffective air-conditioning) ). They sent a guy home, he checked the screen and did nothing but a factory reset. It happened again with my dad, and then, we were advised to make a video of it the next time we face it again. Today, when it happened with me, I noticed the VW interface buttons do not face this issue, and it's just the Carplay screen. I clicked the 'settings' button and went back to Carplay and it started functioning normally. Here's a video that I managed to get: https://youtube.com/watch?v=zohlQis2bWg?feature=share ", 5th May 2022,volkswagen-taigun,DEL,123,465
1302, throttleflick , 22:55 ,BHPian,"3900 KM update on my Taigun 1.0 Topline AT. Observations: - The door beading noise has become bothersome now. The noise disappears after a car wash but it does reappear again. - Road noise on the stock MRF Wanderers is manageable except for when I've exited the Mumbai Pune expressway. A whine is heard above 50km/hr speeds. Makes me feel like I'm driving some thing way more powerful than what is there in the engine bay. - I'm confused about the optimum tyre pressure on the car. Originally, I had bought this car as a two people mover and hence I used to set it to 33 Psi as mentioned on the rhs door pillar. My change of base to Pune meant more people want to sit in the Taigun so I've been keeping the tyre pressure to 35 for all the four wheels. - The car is an absolute hoot to drive. I think this is the only German thing about it. - The boot space is more than adequate for luggage of two people. Fold the seats and I've been comfortably able to shift my stuff from Thane to Pune in 5 trips. - The air conditioning is adequate in Pune's 38 degree weather. I used to leave it on auto earlier but now cycle between level 2 and 3 with a temperature range between 19 and 22degrees. - At times, the blower does some weird yoga antics. Inhale exhale kinda stuff if you know what I mean. - Headlamp throw, I've found it inadequate on roads without dividers. Can get a bit scary and it does keep me on the edge of my seat. - I always thought I'd never be able to find a perfect driving position. This changed when I set the seat to the lowest setting and the back aches are a thing of the past. My right arm doesn't have anywhere to rest so that kinda hurts. - Given the terrain and the really short drive to my favourite vada pav wala, I've been seeing pretty abysmal mileage. Combine that with highway runs between Pune - Thane and back, the mileage is around 10km/l. I'm okay with that mileage figure. - Since the roads where I live have a bit of an incline and a gradient, the transmission doesn't shift to D1 when I go to a full stop while going over a speed bump. The transmission acts confused at times at D1 and D2 so I manually shift to D1 at speeds under 15km/hr. - I used to get pretty good mileage numbers earlier when I was using XP95. A change to Shell V Power has thrown these 10 km/l numbers. I've no recollection of what mileage I was getting with XP95 but I am pretty sure it was above 13km/l. Finding XP95 in Pune has been a chore. The Shell pump is a kilometer away from me and hence that has been my go to fuel of choice. I might switch to the lesser expensive normal fuel from Shell. OR. I could fill up with normal Shell fuel to get me to the IOCL pump and then tank up on XP95. - On the expressway, cruise control has been such a bliss to use. Just chill, keep manning the pedals and i/orvms, change lanes and again, chill. 80-100km/hr has been the norm. 80 km/hr in the middle lane and 100 km while overtaking. - Expressway runs with controlled speeds means I see 19km/l on the MID which excites me a lot until I exit the expressway on either ends of the cities. - The rear bench has been comfortable for two people. The hand rest permanently rests in the open position. Although, when there are 5 of us travelling, one unlucky elder has to occupy the middle seat. I love it when that occupant isn't one of my favourite people. It is not a comfortable place to be in. This car is a strict 4 seater for the kinda people I have in my family. - The amount of features on this car was overwhelming for me, coming from a 2007 Toyota Innova. Although, save for a couple of them, I found them to be at par with a 2014 Honda City which my uncle owns. - I love the cabin at night. Illuminated switches are pleasing to the eye. The puddle lamp(?) in the door handles could have been powerful, but they're there and it is such a nice touch. - The window safety lock switch only locks the rear windows. I always thought the front passenger window also got locked. I thought this was a fault until I consulted the owners manual. - The ORVMs are horribly small, inspire no confidence on Pune roads. I've had to unlearn whatever driving I've learnt as a kid and an adult when I shifted bases to Pune and these ORVMs don't instil confidence in me. - Initially while finalizing the Taigun over Polo, I thought the roof liner might be a let down. But this hasn't been a problem at all. Sure the quality could have been better, but honestly it isn't much of a bother. - Love the steering wheel. - The piano black finish on some interior bits has started to get hairline scratches. These trim pieces won't age gracefully. I can't find another material I can cover these trim pieces with hence I'd let them be the way they are until a suitable time for getting them wrapped comes. - Felt lining in the door release well seems like a mod I'll take up, along with lining the bottle holder and the door pads. The plastic on the door release is prone to scratches from the finger nails and bottles rattle a lot in the door pads. This should dampen the rattle and thus the noise. - The alloys are stunning to look at. The drive quality is a compromise on bad roads. But it isn't that bad. I haven't felt uncomfortable being in the seat as much as I thought I would. Maybe, more driving time on bad terrain might reveal the quality. Doesn't glide over potholes, have to be careful, but it isn't scary as well incase I go over it. - The car has gaps where dry leaves, fine grains of sand settle. Especially around the boot. - I've also made a mental note to check all the fluids in the engine bay at 5k odo reading. - The long term stats on the ODO got reset suddenly around 800kms ago. I've no clue why this happened and I am very certain I won't get these stats back. For the better part of the 3200km long term reading, I saw 13.2km/l mileage. - The infotainment system is pretty well integrated but feels incomplete. Same point about the instrument cluster. I wish there was a trip meter like other cars and not the way VW has implemented it in this iteration. Overall, I'm happy about the purchase. Sure it is an overpriced package but for those who love driving, I think it is a good car. Ventilated seats are comfortable and we use them frequently. The ground clearance is a big win for me in terms of the roads my car frequents. I hope there is some mod potential like the Polo has. I feel this will happen after a facelift or two where current gen owners are able to add features from the next gen cars while the next gen owners are able to add features deleted from the current gen ones.

1309, gngdev , 20:14 ,Newbie,"We were looking for a replacement for our 2013 Ford Figo TDCI which we had sold in Feb. We needed only by around October but we started our hunt early due to the large waiting period now. Since our daily running is quite high (40 KMs for me, 80 KMs for my wife at her current posting) we had finalized on Nexon EV. Even though we had almost finalized on Nexon EV, we checked out the following cars around the same price range on the same day. 1. Astor Turbo AT/ Astor NA CVT: The Astor appeared to be luxurious inside out. And the Turbo AT drove well as well. But we found the under thigh support was a bit poor. Also it was a bit too out of the budget considering the FE and additional running cost over the price of the car. We also test drove the 1.5 NA CVT. It had the rubber band effect going against it in addition to the poor under thigh support. 2. Honda City AT: We did not test drive the vehicle but the city interiors did not appeal to me or my wife. Though there is a lot more space inside in the CITY, we loved the interiors in Nexon much more than this. Now, we had few time left with us for the Nexon EV test drive vehicle to arrive (It was out for a test drive for another customer and we thought we would rather get the test drive done in the same day as getting a time for a test drive together later would take 1-2 weeks). It was already late (around 6:15 PM) and we thought of checking out the Taigun as well. We immediately called EVM VW Cheranellur and the sales rep mentioned they are still open and we could have a test drive. We headed to the EVM showroom, even though it was raining heavily. They were (Mr Shibu and Mr Sanoop) very courteous and offered a test drive of the car. We were interested in 1.0 AT only due to reliability concerns of DSG. Loved the car, the overall space and comfort and was fun enough to drive. Now we were very impressed with the attitude of the sales team and they mentioned they have a very good offer from VW for the month of April (50k discount on Ex-Showroom price) and that it is the first time VW has given such a good offer. We were not looking for an ICE vehicle and we just asked whether they could arrange a test drive on the following Sunday at my home (20 Kms away), so that my parents could check it out as well. They promptly agreed. (We had asked the same question to the MG sales guys as well, but they said they do not work on Sundays so arranged one for the following Saturday) On Sunday morning, I just asked my father on his opinion on changing the 2009 Dzire Zxi our parents currently drive (Both my parents still drive). He said he will think about it. Anyways, Mr Sanoop came with the car for test drive (Really appreciate this considering his wife was admitted in hospital for delivery. He mentioned this when he came, otherwise we would have not asked him to come). Both my parents liked the car and we asked the exchange price for our 2009 Dzire and he mentioned a decent price. We discussed this within family and decided to go ahead with the Highline 1.0 AT Curcuma Yellow, considering the 50K discount and imminent price hike in May. Paid 10k advanced on the same day and completed the balance payment within 2 days. We got the car delivered on the following Saturday The MG showroom arranged the test drive on the same day we took delivery of the Taigun (We had informed them that we booking the car would be unlikely upfront but they still came for the test drive). I casually informed the Sales rep that he could have got a sale had he arranged a test drive on the previous Sunday. So I would say, just because of the attitude of the sales guys at EVM VW, we bought a new car out of the blue. There was no plan to replace our parents car and it just happened very spontaneously. We still have the Nexon EV booked as our Figo replacement and the booking experience is a different story altogether. This is the price break up of what we paid: Ex Showroom: 1439900 TCS: 14399 Insurance: 27500 (Including 50% NCB from Dzire) Road Tax: 188202 TP & Fastag: 700 Cash Discount: -50000 Corporate Discount: -5000 Total: 16,26,201 We did not opt for the accessories package costing around 10,500. Chose to order a mat online and get the mudflaps fitted later as they did not have the mat and mudflaps in stock separately. We also took the extended warranty for 5&6 year at 29,499 and the 3rd and 4th year service package at 16,499 (The 1st and 2nd year service package was already included as part of the April offer). This is the first VW in our family. I hope we will have a trouble free experience with this. Also such was the experience with the Sales team that we did not even cross check for better offers with other dealers.

1310, adigup , 19:43 ,BHPian,"Quick update on the mileage figures of my 1.0 MT mini-Tiguan: Our Taigun is used by everyone at home - mostly by my mom and then dad and I use it whenever it's parked at home. My parents had gone away for a 12 day holiday, during which I parked the other two cars safely, and went ahead and made the Taigun my daily drive. According to the odometer reset, I drove 708.9 kms in 12 days. Most of the driving was in traffic hours, and little bit of it on empty roads / highways. To give some idea, I live in Gurgaon (~5 kms from Ambience Mall) and go to Delhi almost every day. During the 12 days, I also took the car to Old Delhi, North Campus, and all possible places with traffic of all types (not for fun, but for work). While I was able to record the highest mileage of 23 kmpl when I went from Gurgaon to CP at 8:30 AM on a Monday (with AC of course, and maintaining a speed of 70-80 kmph on the highway, and then 60 kmph in Delhi roads) Lowest of 13.5 kmpl, when I went from Gurgaon to North campus (during peak Karol Bagh traffic hours in the afternoon) and back (close to 70 kms). While I didn't keep a track of all the trips,here's a picture of what the car showed after 390 kms of refuelling. (ignore the red-ish edge, probably something wrong with my camera) Overall, I think if driven sedately (and of course, once in a while, let the turbo do it's job when redlining the engine) this car is very efficient. I wasn't expecting figures above 15 kmpl in any case, but this is past my expectations. With everyone driving it on regular days, it returns 12-14 kmpl, which is fair enough.", 9th May 2022,volkswagen-taigun,DEL,123,465

Having zeroed down on the Taigun, I am now torn between a 1.0L Manual and a 1.0L Automatic transmission. The following considerations are to be made: -Planning this one for a 10Yr+ period (I'm currently 32 yrs old) Major usage: Driven by wifey and me on trips out of Bengaluru (We have my wife's car which will be used for in-city bumper-bumper traffic) Minor usage: Office commute on rainy days (since I'd any day prefer a bike for office commute on other days) Budget (Highline and Highline AT, both are in consideration. 1.5L s are out) Although I like spirited driving and travelling, I don't precisely indulge in pushing performance limits or getting greater speeds. 1. There's a self of me who is sad not to have owned and driven a manual car ever. Buying a manual, keeping it as a classic, maintaining the man-machine connection. It prefers the engagement required for driving a stick and the control it offers. Buying an automatic almost feels like the end of an era to this self. 2. There's the other self of me who bets in the next 5 years I will end up missing the convenience of an AT and then regret my decision.

Must say, driving pleasure is awesome as compared to Creta or Seltos. All good parts are already mentioned in the forum. What should be there and what should not be there is already highlighted. But I want to highlight few things which are bothering me a lot personally from the perspective of a non-enthusiastic driver after 1 month of driving. 1.) No sunglass holder. 2.) Car horn (No one takes me seriously on Delhi roads when I blow horn) 3.) Plasticky door panel (should provide upholstry atleast there.) 4.) Annoying smell inside. (must be due to Delhi heat) 5.) Mileage inside the city = max 8kmpl I got. Never driven on highway yet. 6.) One touch Up/Down not working. 7.) Small potholes felt inside. OVERALL: Driving pleasure is fantastic. Pickup is amazing.

Remember - in a matter of a decade or so (or maybe less?!) - anyway mainstream cars seem to be going away from ICEs, taking away the stick altogether. EVs or whatever else that comes - will be automatics in all likelihood. So its better that you go for the AT and join that trend early like most others. If you live in a metro and bulk of your travels are in the traffic jammed areas - AT is a no brainer. As for keeping the car for long - trust me - none of the cars available right now in our average Joe budgets are worthy of becoming a classic ever (including the ones I own and the one you have finalized, no offence).

If I may ask, what made you choose a manual over an automatic when you bought your last car? Hey good afternoon. I have always loved the charm of shifting gears. I'm one of those who will weep for some days when these old-school engineering marvels called manual gearboxes will go into sunset. I don't drive much fast, but I enjoy timing a gear-shift well. So MT makes sense for me as long as the knee doesn't collapse. Then - the car I liked is the Nexon diesel. The AT option on it is an AMT. No way I was buying that, so MT it had to be. Had a TCAT been on offer - maybe things would have been different, who knows! That said - do note that I also have an AMT in the garage that I use like a scooter. When I know I'm going to get stuck in traffic or go through the most congested places of the city - I always take this go-cart like little car out, not the Nexon. I can easily note that I take out the Alto AMT far more often to go deep into the city, than I did the MT Vista in past. So - AT does make a big difference in daily use. To simplify my perspective - if I were out buying my FIRST car right now and it was to be the single car in my parking - I'd definitely pick an AT over an MT. The practicality outweighs everything by quite a margin. If I was buying any of Slavia-Kushaq-Virtus-Taigun - I am more than sure that I'd buy the automatic (but the 1.5 DSG ones, for the sheer fun factor ). In fact - the way things are - my garage is now set for quite some time & highly possible that my next car might be an EV directly. If not - it will only be if I take a whimsical (and outwardly stupid) decision of buying a Thar. And then - I already know that it will be a Diesel AT Thar. Not MT.

1333, Petronius , 21:08 ,Newbie,"Hello everyone, This is my first post on Team-BHP. I recently bought the Volkswagen Taigun 1.5 GT in its manual guise. Have done about 1200kms in a couple of weeks since delivery. I have tried to capture my buying decision and experiences so far with the Taigun GT MT here. Buying Decision: To be honest, I didnt look beyond the VW family when I started to look for a replacement for my 5-year-old 1.2 MPI Polo Highline. That little fellow (Polo) though had a smaller heart, always punched above its weight. In fact, it would bleed its heart out when required to keep me entertained while I pushed it to its limits. It required everything from that little fellow to compete with bigger cars which I always did. And compete it did, without complaining once. We had fun whenever we were together. Except for the outright performance, I liked and cherished every bit the car had to offer such as the precise steering, high-speed stability, good drive-ability, and above all its reliability. Havent had a single incident in all my years of ownership. I thought I will never depart with this little wonder. But life had other plans. With the kid entering the scene, I wanted something bigger, more spacious, and of course a solid performer! I had only two options: VW Vento I thought the Vento 1.0tsi would be a substantial upgrade for me coming from the 1.2 Polo. But one test drive was enough to tell me that it's ditto to my existing Polo at least from the inside. Yes, the heart was bigger but everything else the same. I felt I would soon outgrow the love for the peppy engine and be bored by similar interior elements. And so my search for the replacement continued. VW Taigun From the day, VW officially launched the Taigun twins I was smitten by the looks of them. I liked the 1.5 tsi engine better from the beginning but knew for sure if at all I can buy one that would be the smaller yet potent one with a 1.0 tsi. I started reading and watching a lot of reviews of the cars. While a dozen of them were all praise for the German mile munchers, some were pointing fingers at the evident cost-cutting in the Taigun twins. I was a little hesitant to take the plunge because of the reported drop in quality. After what sounded like ages, I decided to just pay a visit to the VW dealer in Madurai convincing myself that I was not gonna sell the Polo or buy the Taigun but just check out the new Taigun twins. But one look at the Taigun in flesh is all it took to make me feel weak on my knees. I fell for the car at that moment. I knew then and there that my camaraderie with the little Polo will have to end now. Adding fuel to my fire, the missus was sold on Taigun too, and insisted we get it somehow. In a way, I was glad that I now have someone else to blame. Test Drive Experience So off we went for test rides on both the 1.0 automatic and 1.5. DSG. Somehow the manuals werent available. I was mighty impressed with both of the motors coming from a humble 1.2 MPI. I was grinning from ear to ear throughout the rides. While the 1.0 tsi begged to be driven hard, the 1.5 tsi was all about effortless performance. I immediately liked how the 1.5 tsi pulled past 100kmph. Effortless is the word for 1.5 tsi. Though I would have liked a bit more heft in the steering wheel at higher speeds, still it felt just about enough to give you the confidence to push it hard around corners. The highway stability at triple-digit speeds was immaculate. The added weight in the 1.5tsi variant made the steering feel a bit more heavy which I liked. As always, after the test drive, the salesman was ready with quotes and discounts. He offered meaty discounts for the 2021 1.0 tsi Highline Automatic. The offer was so tempting that I was convinced to take it. But at the back of my mind, I was thinking about the 1.5tsi. Keeping in mind that probably I will keep the car for the next 7-8 years. Which also coincides with my prime driving age. I thought I would just give the 1.5tsi Manual a try. The salesperson agreed to bring a 1.5 tsi test mule in its manual guise in a couple of days. So we left the showroom. On the return journey, I was kind of sad that my journey with my ever so reliable Polo has to end soon. I gave the leather steering and the plastic armrest a gentle squeeze as if to assure the car that I wasnt parting anytime soon. The connection was just too strong for me. Machines indeed do become a part of us, dont they?. But there was no way (Financially) for me to keep Polo and get the Taigun. So I had to make the hard decision if I wanted an upgrade. A couple of days later, on one Sunday morning, I called the salesman about the 1.5 gt mt test mule and he told me that the 1.5 gt mt was on a trip to a nearby city and that it will only come in the evening making it hard for them to bring in the evening. So he asked for one more days time. As eager as I was, I decided to visit the showroom in the evening by myself. Off I went and reached the showroom premises sharp around 4 pm. The 1.5 GT MT hadnt arrived yet, the salesperson told me that it will take about an hour for the car to come till then I can test drive the 1.0 topline Automatic to my heart's content. The showroom is situated on a highway so I jumped at the opportunity. The plan was to meet the guy with the 1.5 GT MT on the way. So off we went. The convenience of an automatic is unmatched. Though I have hardly driven automatic cars, it was a seamless transition. The gear shifts were almost unnoticed and the bottom end lag was very much under control. The ride quality was fantastic. It's only on really bad roads the thuds from potholes and unduly road connections were passed on to the cabin. The car reached triple-digit speeds in no time. It was relatively quieter for a 3-cylinder unit. The paddle shifters worked well. And it became an instant addiction. The only downside was that post the 120kmph mark, the car felt a little strained in D mode. Only a little though unlike my 3 pot 1.2 polo. Handling was good but still not perfect like my Polo. Maybe it's gotta do with the lighter steering feel. I may be wrong here. Mileage was a concern for me since the MID showed mileage in single digits for our trip thus far. When checked with the sales guy, he assured 12-13 in the city and 17 on the highway if we drove sanely. I nodded in disbelief. We finally met the guy with the 1.5 GT MT and we switched cars. The bare bone feeling was evident the moment I stepped into the car. No sunroof, no cruise control, no digital cockpit, and no push-button start. Only driver side one touch up. All four sides one touch up which even my 5-year-old Polo had felt like a luxury. I just reminded myself that if I wanted the 1.5tsi engine, then this is the variant I can afford and so I quietened all the other thoughts and gave the key a twist to fire up the car. The clutch was a little awkwardly placed for my liking. The biting point was a little tricky to find but got used to it rather quickly. The car lurched forward to about 10kmph when I let go of my foot from the clutch. I switched to second and gently pressed the A pedal, the car was easily doing 40kmph. Switched to third at 50kmph and floored the Pedal, boy o boy, now that's a feeling I have missed in my earlier cars. The thrust from 150 horses and 250nm torque was something to experience. Post the 100kmph mark, this mad machine was relentless in the way it pulled all the way up to unmentionable speeds. I was totally impressed with the performance of the car. At that moment, I decided that no matter what Im getting that car. That's when I decided to buy the 1.5GT MT. Yes, the car was bare bone when it came to the features, no bells nor whistles. But the way it drove, it tugged at my heart. And so I got out completely satisfied from the test drive. While I was very impressed, I didnt let the sales guy get any ideas. Which I thought might become a hindrance while negotiating deals. I just asked him for a final quote for the car. He informed me that they had a 2021 White GT MT. And that they can deliver in a week. I wasnt ready to take the delivery in a week. Asked him anyway to work out a quote with their best pricing. He offered a good exchange price for my polo as well and came up with a deal too good to refuse for the 1.5GT MT. I asked him for a couple of days' time and left. Sealing the deal Within a couple of days, I asked them to bring the car to my house which is about an hour-long journey from the showroom. They obliged and came all the way. Took another test drive with my in-laws. They all liked it. Negotiated the final deal and booked the car that day. They promised to deliver the car in a week's time. With everything being finalized, I was asked to hand over my Polo a couple of days before delivery. I asked them if I could hand over the car when I come to do the PDI for the new car. They obliged. And so I took my best buddy Polo for one final ride. It was a day when I experienced joy and misery at the same time. Together we had fun one last time. I never got disappointed with this little buddy of mine. I recorded a nice tribute. I told myself that Polo always enabled me to get bigger things in life. Now it has sacrificed itself for me to get the bigger brother. With that exact thought, I entered the showroom and my eyes caught hold of a White Taigun in all its glory under the afternoon sunlight. Immediately I knew in my mind that the one there had to be my new ride. Just called the sales guy and asked if that was the one to which he confirmed. Parked my little Polo next to the big guy and clicked the pictures. It is when I realized that in fact, Taigun is in a way what Polo would look like if it evolved. There were so many similarities. From the bumper to the way headlights were laid out, everything was so much similar at least to my eyes. Literally, I felt my polo just got evolved. PDI Referred to Team-bhps PDI guide and followed it step by step. It had run about 150 km since they had to bring this from another city in the state. The trip meter and the driving data showed the exact numbers too. So I was convinced. I sat in the car for some time. Taking in all the feeling of newness as well as I can. Took pictures as well just in case I missed noticing anything. It's only after I hopped onto my new car I felt a little relieved about letting go of my Polo. This was for me after all an evolved Polo. With that, I handed over my car to the guys at the showroom and asked them to use the cover and sell it to someone who would take care of the car well. I walked away quickly to avoid getting any more emotional. I signed some papers and made the payment and left for the day. Delivery Experience Since I had to take my 1-month-old child, I told them I wanted no formalities done at the time of delivery and asked them to complete the delivery process in under 30 minutes at max. They were up for that. On the delivery day (April 26, 2022), they gave me a call around noon to inform me that my car was registered and that the Wheel hub needs to be replaced as part of some precautionary campaign. I was spooked at first but read some posts on team bhps Kushaq ownership forum and made up my mind and gave them the go-ahead. They informed me that they also changed the door beading. I was okay as long as I was getting a trouble-free car. With everything getting done, they asked me to come around 5:30 in the evening. We hopped onto our in-laws 1,30,000 km driven Xylo and reached the showroom around 5:15 pm. Finished some more paper works and without any hoopla, they handed me the keys with just a picture and a sweet box. I thanked the salesman who put in all the effort and promised to take him for lunch or dinner sometime and left. Early Impressions One thing that I havent noticed in all the test drives thus far is the fact that this car was very smooth. It made absolutely no noise while idling. The start/stop function was a little annoying though as it stalled the car even while trying to cross speed breakers. I turned it off immediately. Rest was just glorious. The ride quality was something we liked immediately. It was very quite over the annoying rumble strips. Though the distance to empty showed 180kms, I filled up fuel within 10 km. The car was easily doing speeds of 90-100 kmph. With the infant in the car I had to moderate the throttle now and then to keep it under 80 kmph. It was a struggle. The car pulled neatly from as low as 1200RPM in any gear. I just slotted to 3rd gear around barricades and the car picked up pace gently from there. I realized that it was an effortless car after all. It didnt require too many gear shifts. Which I liked very much. Thumps up for the drivability. On speed breakers, you can easily sit on 2nd gear and getaway. I will try to note down my likes and dislikes. Please read them with the hint that these are early impressions and are subject to change. Likes * The butter smooth and very punchy 1.5 TSI EVO motor. Effortless performance. It is a delight. * Impeccable ride quality. Takes everything in its stride. Only on really bad roads do you hear the thud inside. * High-speed stability and poise. It almost matched up to my erstwhile buddy Polo here. * Drivability. Just try the 1.5 manual once you will understand what Im talking about. * Build quality. The doors and boot are heavy and shut with a thud. That's reassuring of the VWs top-class build quality I guess. * Hill assist, a bonus feature is very useful on sharp inclines and ramps when we accidentally stall the car. I guess VW forgot about this feature in 1.5 GT MT else they would have removed this as well. * Economy seems good if we drive sanely. * Legroom for the rear passengers. It's enormous for someone coming from Polo. * The red ambient lighting is very appealing at night. Dislikes * The faulty one touch up driver side button. It has a mind on its own. * The switches on the doors are slightly flimsy. * Roof liner quality isnt very great. * No cruise control.

1338, Atharva14 , 17:40 ,BHPian,"Retro-fitting Auto folding ORVMs on my Taigun Topline MT Alright so we all know about the chip shortage scene and due to this VW didn't provide auto-fold mirrors in Taigun for a particular period of time. My car (JAN 22 regd.) was affected by this. Anyways recently they started providing customers with the same. I mailed VW India and got a prompt reply from a service center. They placed the part order under my confirmation and received it within a week's time. Took an appointment today and got it done. Cost- Rs.15000/- (I was provided a flat discount of the same amount while purchasing the car hence had to pay it now.) What does the Auto-folding kit comprise of? Well at first I thought it would just be the rotary knob that needs to be changed but to my surprise, the kit consisted of- 1. 2 Mirrors(Without glass and without the mirror cover. This is used from the current mirror setup.) 2. Rotary switch(See picture) 3. New window winder motor(Yes, this needs to be changed too, probably this is the electrical source for folding unfolding of mirrors.) The process was smooth. Old mirror covers were removed with the mirror and replaced with new ones. The glass was used from the old mirror as well. The new switch was connected with the new window motor. Auto up-down of the window wasn't functioning after this because the system wasn't coded to the new motor. After doing the same, everything worked perfectly. Now the mirrors open/close automatically while Locking/unlocking and through the switch. The old mirrors, switch, and window motor was provided back with the car. I don't know what to do with it now, lets's see! Attaching pictures for reference! https://youtube.com/watch?v=6TMqKllBbPI?feature=share ", 21st May 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Mumbai,50,235

What was not addressed, even to a minor extent, is the door creaking/squeaking noises over rough roads or uneven speed breakers.

1355, abhinav1817 , 10:25 ,BHPian,"Hi All, I currently own a 2014 Hyundai Xcent Petrol Manual and am looking out to upgrade to CSUVs. The 3 options I have in my mind are Seltos/Creta/Taigun. (Like how Taigun looks over Kushaq so considering only this between the German twins; infact like Seltos looks way better than current Creta but panoramic sunroof and 3 person rear seating gives Creta the edge and hence still under consideration with a facelift) But back to Taigun. I am looking for 1.5 GT plus DSG. So I am yet to test drive the vehicle as last weekend, the showroom did not had the car when I visited. So waiting for the first hand experience. Meanwhile, i wanted opinion from owners here in the group on below concerns which i have reading through multiple T-bhp threads and youtube review videos: 1. I understand the rear seating is not as good as say Creta but what about Xcent or other sub 4m vehicles, is it not at all a 5 seater? 2. Is the AC bad for 1.5 GT? (I read some threads on it being modest for 1.0) 3. I also read that reverse camera is bad and even worse in low light environment. What's the owner's take here? 4. Has anyone went for a 360 camera from after sales market? If yes, hows the feedback? 5. I also read that GT plus does not ventilated seats which are available in lower trims. Is there a plan to change/upgrade as i find this very strange.? The reason i am reaching out here is the car costs 23L OTR in bangalore which is like the max budget stretched out for me. And I am ok to let go some gimmicks offered by Korean twins but things like poor camera, manual height seat adjustment, missing ventilated seats are a big let down.

Well the rear seating capacity depends upon the size of the individuals too, you can seat 3 60 kg people , but 3 healthy size adults would not be comfortable at all. Moreover the problem is due to the side bolstering present in side seats whereas the middle one is raised. If the bench was completely flat like some cars 3 people would have been more comfortable, but your test drive experience would clarify you that clearly. 1. Well most of the complaints are coming from the 1.0 engine, the AC of German cars have never been exceptional but folks who own 1.5 aren't complaining. 2. Well it's average, I have sat in Honda, TATA and MG cars and haven't seen a good reverse camera yet, but I remember sitting in Seltos and it had a pretty good camera. The camera in Taigun gets the job done. 3. The aftermarket 360 would void your warranty so think about that before getting it. 4. Well yes the Taigun 1.5 GT Topline variant doesn't have ventilated seats, whereas the 1.0 Topline variant has it. To get 1.5 TSI with ventilated seats you'll have to buy Virtus/Slavia/Kushaq. I think you can consider the new sedans as well, costs less, has the same or more features, has a bigger boot and looks good too.

There is a fix available from VW for this issue. In the 1000km inspection service they said adjustments were made in the door, but the issue persisted. Then at around 3500km i got a call from them that VW had come up with a fix, they then sprayed three coats of a lubricant over the beadings and said this will solve the issue. But some creaking persisted, at this point I got a little impatient and insisted they do something better. Had a word with the service manager, which is when i learnt about the existence of anti-friction strip. So during the second inspection service they assured the issue will be sorted out soon and that their service head was at Pune for training on this. But what surprised me was that the dealer told me that VW was paying only for 3 doors' anti-friction strip, I insisted they apply this to all the doors - i was told I'll have to pay Rs. 400 for the 4th door strip, I just wanted the problem to be sorted and agreed to pay. But this is not cool VOLKSWAGEN INDIA. What VW should have done, is made a recall and fixed the issue than irritate customers who preferred Taigun over Creta/Seltos and made us go through this ordeal to get this fix. I felt Rs. 400 is actually the cost of 4 strips. Details about the strip itself - it's made by Saint Gobain, attaching pics of the fix and the bill for reference. Following this fix done at 8300km I've never faced the creaking issue again. The car has run 11900km so far. Please bear with the long post, wanted to share my experience with the other issues faced by me and others as well. But one issue i face is that the one touch up of the driver side window doesn't work properly most of the time - the window rolls up halfway and rolls back down, whenever this happens it happens twice. The third attempt it stops midway, following which the one touch up just gives way, I've got so used to this routine that I don't even attempt one touch up now. They have done basic setting of the windows multiple times, other than this issue, I'm just loving the car so I've even stopped complaining about this hoping that when the electrically folding ORVM is available anyway the window will get a new motor which should solve the issue. I'm just hoping someone from VOLKSWAGEN INDIA is reading all these minor issues faced by customers. As for the AC, I've figured out a way of cooling down the car sooner - pop up the sunroof, crack down all 4 windows just a couple of inches down, let the AC be at 22-24 degrees Celcius on auto with outside in circulation, at this point don't use ventillation of the seats - the car cools down to a not uncomfortable space within 30seconds, i close the windows at this point, within the next 30 seconds the car cools down further and i shut the sunroof as well. The fan blower speed will still be high, so i switch to manual and decrease fan speed to 3 and also switch to inside circulation. After about 2 minutes I then switch to Auto with inside circulation. I've got so used to this routine now. As for the efficiency of the AC, i have never felt that it's not able to cool the car (highest temperature I've faced so far is 36.5 degrees Celcius). As for the mileage - I have a sedate driving pattern, excepting revving on empty roads just to hear the engine roar in the first and second gears occasionally. I always always wait for about 30 seconds after turning on the engine for the rpm to reach from 1500 to 1000, initially i used to wait just 10 seconds after a cold start and journey on, but this gyaan of waiting for the rpm to drop was given by a close friend Dr. KCK from Coorg who owns a Skoda Kushaq 1.0L MT style variant. I get an average mileage of 16-18kmpl (60% highway & 40% city). Within Mysore city I get around 14-16kmpl, on dual carriageway highways where I can't use Cruise control I get around 17-18.5kmpl. On proper highways with cruise control mileage is sweet at 20-22kmpl. Max I've ever got is 23kmpl. I always keep the AC at 24, sometimes higher. I never keep the AC below 22. PS.: Have tinted the windows using Garware lite NF carbon films with 50% Visibility.

Quote: But one issue i face is that the one touch up of the driver side window doesn't work properly most of the time - the window rolls up halfway and rolls back down, whenever this happens it happens twice. The third attempt it stops midway, following which the one touch up just gives way, I've got so used to this routine that I don't even attempt one touch up now. I had the same issue which I reported here on the forum as well. They reset the mechanism during the last check up and it has not happened again. So, fingers crossed on that one. I too wish that VW listens to these inputs and comes with a permanent fix. Quote: As for the AC, I've figured out a way of cooling down the car sooner - pop up the sunroof, crack down all 4 windows just a couple of inches down, let the AC be at 22-24 ... As for the efficiency of the AC, i have never felt that it's not able to cool the car (highest temperature I've faced so far is 36.5 degrees Celcius). Yes, this what I have done in the rare situation the car was parked in the open under high sun. However, the AC does seem to have issues with general capability. Again, something I hope VW can fix. Quote: As for the mileage - I have a sedate driving pattern, excepting revving on empty roads just to hear the engine roar in the first and second gears occasionally. I always always wait for about 30 seconds after turning on the engine for the rpm to reach from 1500 to 1000, initially i used to wait just 10 seconds after a cold start and journey on, but this gyaan of waiting for the rpm to drop was given by a close friend Dr. KCK from Coorg who owns a Skoda Kushaq 1.0L MT style variant. I get an average mileage of 16-18kmpl (60% highway & 40% city). Within Mysore city I get around 14-16kmpl, on dual carriageway highways where I can't use Cruise control I get around 17-18.5kmpl. On proper highways with cruise control mileage is sweet at 20-22kmpl. Max I've ever got is 23kmpl. I always keep the AC at 24, sometimes higher. I never keep the AC below 22. Man, what would I not give to get those mileage numbers! I maintain a detailed file of petrol fill ups and associated calculations. The numbers are not even close to yours. Question - are these the numbers from the instrument panel or calculated tank full to tank full? Mine are based, obviously, on the latter. I will try out the ""waiting for RPM to drop"" technique. One thing I have tried this time around is switching the AC completely off before shutting the car down for the day. It will be switched on manually in the morning when I take the car out and that too after running about a km or so. Seems to have a subtle impact. Here's a view of my fuel numbers. Quote: PS.: Have tinted the windows using Garware lite NF carbon films with 50% Visibility. Front and rear windshields have clear films rated at 70% visibility, of a generic brand. Is this ok to do?

I was under the impression that any film on glass is illegal. Thank you asmr. On a full tank i get more or less 750km. The average fuel economy numbers are based on tank full to tank full method. The average is 16.304 kmpl. This is with about 3000 to 3500 km per month with about 1000km of highway driving and about 60km per day within the city. Haven't got to test proper long distance highway driving so far, have done Mysore to Bellur around 60 times, one Coorg trip and Mysore-Bangalore-Mysore a couple of times. Looking forward to the first long distance trip - Mysuru to Chennapatnam (Chennai) later this month. I feel the average on the display is quite accurate with an error of less than 1kmpl, as compared to error of more than 2kmpl in the i10 nios. As for the tint, I agree that it's a grey area are to whether it's legal. But considering my profession which involves late night drives to other hospitals by the wife or myself - for the sake of privacy and safety I had to go for the tint, the added advantage is the faster cooling down of the cabin in the afternoons and reduced glare from high beams of oncoming traffic at night. Also most of my journeys will be by car and predominantly at night in order to save on usability of daytime since I cannot take long leave (maximum 2 days in a row including Sundays). The friendly neighborhood car accessory guy has applied the tint leaving just a millimeter below the top of the window edge, so it's really difficult to tell whether sun film is applied or the window is tinted. Earlier in the i10 Nios I was stopped in Goa for the tint and paid fine. Whenever I'm stopped for this issue, I don't argue with the cops in other states, I just pay the fine. But in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu I tell them the reason and they are quite understanding about it and let me off saying it's a mild tint anyway. But so far I haven't been stopped for the tint in the Taigun. PS.: I still haven't figured out how to disconnect calls from the steering wheel. The dealership people keep telling me it's possible. I'm going to give them a practical demonstration when I go for the 15000km service next month and ask them to show me how to disconnect the call. Since there is no physical button to cancel attended calls, calls have to be disconnected on the touch screen - Now I've developed a bad habit of receiving calls on the touchscreen even though this can be done from the steering. What's worse is that next to the cruise control buttons there is a button without function, they could have either given a call disconnect function or mute function at the least. I will contact VW regarding why I was charged for the anti-friction tapes. Thank you atharva14 and Throttleflick for your inputs.", 6th June 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Mysore,108,421

Thank you atharva14 and Throttleflick for your inputs. I didn't realize that you had a MT car. That might explain the higher mileage numbers.

As for the discrepancy between the average on screen and actuals, I have stopped looking at the screen while driving and just have the speedometer or RPM on the screen. And I didn't mean to come across as judgemental on the tint film. I have heard both yays and nays for films. So thank you so much for the explanation!

1385, al90 , 15:00 ,BHPian,"Hello Everyone, Really excited to be part of this ever growing community, I have been a follower of Team-bhp for a long time and finally got approved just in time for my new Taigun to be delivered. I have booked a 1.0 MT Topline from Kun Volkswagen in Carbon Steel Grey color. This is a big step-up for me, as the Taigun replacing my 8 year old Ritz Zxi (2014), we have relatively low usage and in 8 years the Ritz had clocked only 36764 kms, most of it being highway runs between Pondicherry, Chennai, Trivandrum, Kottayam and Bangalore. It was an awesome car, but a few instances of aquaplaning (on Michelin's ) during Bangalore runs and especially since we now have a kid on board, had to rethink on the safety aspect. In the last 6 months, me and the missus would have test driven cars from quite a few of the major manufacturers. I will not be going into the engines or other details since more experience and knowledgeable reviews are already present, this is a solely my views and my TD experiences (me being someone who can't make up his mind, and by the time that I do, the product is no longer in the market)). Tata - Nexon & Harrier : Great Cars, especially the Harrier, loved the road presence, but was way above our budget, and being a diesel and considering our usage didn't think it was the right fit, the Nexon was rejected since we already own a 1st gen Nexon (4-star GNCAP) and my dad isn't very happy with the service in Trivandrum and Kottayam, hence dropped. Mahindra - Thar and Xuv 700: XUV 700 dreams were killed due to the long wait times and the AX5 was again out of the budget, I loved the THAR not the missus, reason being the lack of luggage space. Again the road presence and the drivability of both the cars were excellent. Hyundai - Creta & Verna Creta was great to drive, but the safety factor was a concern, the Verna was rejected because it was too low for me to get in and out. Kia - Seltos - Sonet: Never got a test drive from the showroom, because they didn't even respond back, however did drive them from my family friends who had recently purchased them, good cars, not great rear seats, again safety was a concern. Maruti Suzuki - S-Cross We loved the car, this is the car we wanted to have, when we heard the news of the 2022 model coming to India we decided to wait for it, but alas the news in May that it would not be launched in India, and the discontinuation of the old S-cross, broke my heart and pushed me over the edge to make up my mind and get a new car. Volkswagen - Taigun -Virtus The Virtus was too long for me, great car, but I really felt a difference between the doors of the Vento and the Virtus, the Vento's door were literally built different, heavier and felt more sturdy, had a friend with a Vento come over to the showroom with me and he confirmed the same with the SA, who also agreed that the Vento's doors are better quality and heavier. We had originally test drove the Taigun back in Dec-21, loved it then but had turned it down due to budget concerns and I only wanted the 1.5 GT, after much consideration and after driving my friends Vento 1.0 TSI AT, I decided that the 1.0 might be best suited since going forward 90% of my driving would be in the city with the occasional highway drives. We were concerned about the EPC issues, rattling, roof liner and the A/C issues, but after reading through the reviews and also have a cousin who is pretty happy with his 1.0 AT, we decided to go ahead and book the Taigun last week. Even though there isn't a NCAP rating yet, we felt more confident on the Taigun and considering VW’s past built quality we decided to go ahead. Also my cousin confirmed that VW has been listening to customers and taking feedback. So now we are waiting for delivery the SA already has a 1.0 MT in Grey readily available, payment was completed on 8th Jun back and from our side. Registration is yet to start, bit of trouble with address on my ID, since multiple id's have different address due to me moving around. Questions: 1. I wanted to know if the 1.0 MT gear knob is illuminated like to AT, couldn't find any videos or pics online or on the forum (apologies if i have missed) ? 2.Do you really think that the sun-film is a necessity, will it give me better cooling over the tinted glass (Chennai is currently 39'C right now) am worried of the tint being torn out by Kerala police as well. 3.

1401, Atharva14 , 19:35 ,BHPian,"2 Months and 4500 KMS in my Taigun! The 4500 kms covered basically include 50 percent of city and 50 percent of highway trips. In this course of time, nothing major has happened rather than just the window motor getting replaced under warranty. Few known issues as reported by Taigun owners include 1. Faulty driver-side window motor(Basically getting replaced under warranty) 2. Door rattling sound(Applying some transparent tape on the door pillars) 3. AC ineffectiveness (No solution from VW as of now) 4. Brake noise(observed in 1.0 AT variants) Well, in my car the ac works perfectly well even at temperatures set in the range of 21-23 c. Cools the cabin gradually with seat ventilation on even on a hot summer day. Though, as observed the compressor does trip in my car when I rev it a bit hard. It's like providing extra power by cutting off the compressor ( Sports mode, huh?) However, it doesn't happen every time so not an issue as such. Mine is manual, there isn't the brake noise which AT users are complaining about. Although, when at good speeds in ghat, braking and turning simultaneously, I've heard a metal clank-type sound. This only comes when I'm going into a corner and braking. Will get this checked in my 7500KMS inspection. On highways, taigun handles the legal speed confidently, the way it should. Cruising at 100KMHR and ac set at 21 degrees with 4 passengers and luggage I've managed to get an overall efficiency of 16 KMPL. Always fuelling up with HP power or IOCL Xp95, COCO petrol pumps. Without Ac, it does manage to get 18-18.5 KMPL. (with 4 pax and luggage). Headlights, I find them excellent, have a good throw and light up the road pretty well. Fog lights too help in the case. The car is a joy to drive in the Ghats, accurate steering feel and a bit stiff suspension really makes it a driver's car! My car comes with MRF wanderers. These are really average tyres in my opinion. Tyre noise does creep into the cabin. Filled them with Nitrogen(33 PSi) and I think the ride feels a bit more stable and less bumpy now. No plans to change the tyres anytime soon. In city conditions, I found the clutch to be a bit hard just like my old humble polo. Manageable if you find a perfect sitting position. Talking about the mileage in the city, well it manages to reach 9-10 KMPL in short trips. While 12-13 KMPL on an open stretch. Overall, I'm okay with the mileage figures as I don't drive it that sedately too! Once the turbo kicks in, the mileage drops. Android Auto works effortlessly both wired and wireless. Never faced any issue. Sygic maps are really helpful in no network regions, it really has most of the data in them. To sum it up, it really has been a great experience and looking forward to munching more miles with this beast! Attaching a few pictures clicked from a recent trip. 700 KMS on Full Tank if driven sedately! ", 23rd June 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Mumbai,50,235

Mine is a 1.0AT TL, 7months, ~4.6K on odo , and the noise is heard only when the brakes are ""just applied lightly"" when the car is extremely slow, with the brake slowing but not holding the car. On the fuel - I have seen people state here (and in my other circles) that they just use normal RON91 and it is just fine. However, I have seen noticeable difference in mileage + performance when using standard fuel vs RON95 (or higher). Mileage seems to dip real bad in city driving even when sedately driven, since much of the gains are wiped in traffic stops and bumper to bumper traffic. The recommended fuel is RON95. At Rs.4 or so higher from normal petrol (if using XP95), it's Rs.200 more per tank full. Not a major difference in my view, considering the upside. But depending on your circumstances (location, commute type, usage etc.), RON91 might suffice too.", 27th June 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Chennai,324,"1,021"

I was also told about the campaign where the rear wheel hubs needed to be replaced to which I agreed. However something strikes me as fishy. The hubs that were removed were Made in India hubs. The replacement ones were from a supplier in China and had part number 6RF501611A. Luckily for my documentation, I had taken a picture of the sealed box it came in. The price on the box is about Rs 2800. I was filing the invoices and noticed that each hub was mentioned on the invoice with tax at about Rs 9500. The part number mentioned on the invoice is 2Q0501611B. My biggest concern is this - Why would they fit a part number that is different from what they have mentioned on the invoice? Parts bins do not usually have a different code for the same part unless there is a some difference. While the part may have the same shape and size, it may have a different tensile strength or a different load carrying capacity.

Coming from Ameo 1.5 DGS, I was right at home. Sadly, Virtus is to long for my me. I am in the market for Sub-4 meter car but somehow Taigun feels ok. Auto gearbox seemed flimsy while putting it in D or any mode as a matter of fact when compared to my Ameo. Not sure if anyone else had the same feeling. SA blamed it on being a test drive vehicle and manhandled by many customers. Manual AC on Highline model was a huge disappointment, reminded me of my Figo which came at 1/3 of this price (approx.).

Test drive vehicles are subjected to abuse both by customers and dealerships. Quote: Manual AC on Highline model was a huge disappointment, reminded me of my Figo which came at 1/3 of this price (approx.). Highline gets Auto AC as well. It is as per the choice of the customer. If you buy a manual AC Highline variant, you get a discount of Rs.15,000. They are doing this due to the chip shortage problems and also to cater to the customers who don't like touchscreen panels. Quote: My Ameo Highline bought over 5 years ago has more features than a segment above Highline. Namely Auto AC, Auto IRVM, All 4 one touch anti-pinch windows. I should get more features on a segment above car with a much higher price tag. Previously, VW's top model was named as Highline, mid model as Comfortline and base model as Trendline. After the introduction of Taigun and Virtus, they reshuffled their variant names. Now, it goes like this- top model as Topline, mid model as Highline and base model as Comfortline. I own a Vento 1.6MPI Highline 2015 which was Vento's top model at that point of time.

1436, adigup , 22:31 ,BHPian,"7200kms, 4 months update: We managed to complete 7200kms on our Taigun 1.0 MT in 4 months, the experience has been decent but only if we keep aside the AC issue and the brake noise issue at crawling speeds. The AC issue is quite evident, but I haven't experienced the brake noise a lot (probably once every 100 kms). The mileage figures have been decent ranging from 11kmpl to 18kmpl on just regular fuel (haven't tried 95/97 Octane even once). As the car was near 7500kms and the next few weeks the car would've been busy, we sent it at 7250kms. As it was a pick-and-drop service, the following points were told to the service advisor. 1. Front doors rattle 2. Brake noise (will probably know in a few 100kms if this has been rectified) 3. AC issue (asked if there was any update, but the advisor was clueless that this is an actual issue and so this was probably ignored) 4. Fix rain/sun/wind deflectors for the side windows The doors and rubbers were lubricated, and the deflectors were fixed for Rs. 2249 (which was also the overall bill). The car was dropped back after about 6 hours. To my surprise, the wind noise / cabin noise has increased after fixing the deflectors, we have it on our other cars as well but never noticed anything like that. The noise is close to something that comes when the windows aren't fully rolled up. This is how it looks: Also, one more interesting find: The VW guys really reset the whole service interval and now according to my Taigun, an oil change or a service is due in another 15,000 kms or 365 days.

It depends on what your requirements are, if you want a spacious SUV then the XUV700 is a better choice but if you want a car as a city-runner with occasional bursts on the highway then the Kushaq/Taigun make more sense due to their comparatively compact size. For the size and engine specs the AX5 variant of the XUV seem VFM but then there are quite a few basic features missing like ACC, Rear parking camera, 4 airbags vs 6 in the top-end VW-Škoda duos, manual IRVM, no cruise control to name a few.

They have done basic setting of the windows multiple times, other than this issue, I'm just loving the car so I've even stopped complaining about this hoping that when the electrically folding ORVM is available anyway the window will get a new motor which should solve the issue. I don't think you need to get a new window motor. The one touch up/down not working in VWs is quite a common problem. The issue might be due to 2 reasons. Window motor losing calibration due to removal of 12V battery, ECU updates/changes or even sometimes for strange reasons. You can fix the calibration by having the ignition on, close the window completely and then hold the button in close position for few seconds (5s+). Then open the window. And when it is fully open, press and hold the button in open position for few seconds. This should do the trick. If not, repeat the procedure with engine running instead of ignition on. Sometimes the track on either side of window in which the glass moves up and down might be a bit too tight, which triggers the anti-pinch function to trigger, as the resistance felt by the motor is higher than normal. This can be solved by spraying some WD-40 in the tracks. Good luck with the fix. And mechanics now-a-days are happy changing parts without analyzing the root cause of the problem. Even if the above solutions didn't work, a good reason to change the windows motor should be provided by VW service. Because window motors (as much as they cause calibration problems of not closing properly), theiir failure rates are very minimal.", 31st July 2022,volkswagen-taigun,CJB-Driel,693,"2,860"

My basic requirements 1) Good mileage (above 16km/per liter on high way). 2) Safety (As I drive maximum on high way and not using car for daily office commute) 3) Enough leg room in rear seat 4) A boot capacity over 350 litre. 5) Good music system. 6) Do not want to change car for next 10 years. I have checked various cars in sub 4 meter segment like Nissan Magnite, Suzuki Breeza, Tata Nexon, Mahindra XUV3OO and found that rear seat leg room is inadequate. Last week I test drive the Taigun 1litre TSI version and found it better. Leg room in rear seat is very good. Boot space was also adequate. I also checked the Skoda Kushaq Amibition classic version of it, both looked similar in terms of boot and seat comfort. Finally decided to book either Taigun highline or Kushaq Ambition classic. But later read reviews in this thread and found that there AC issues in Taigun and Kushaq. Some also reported door rattling and gear shift issues. Are these issues fixed? Please also advise on the build quality of Taigun and Kushaq as well (I hope there is no official global NCAP test result for Taigun). Thanks!", 22nd August 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Chennai,2,0

Quick update - the ASC ran diagnostics and it did show a single error. They had the car for 2 days and figured out that something in the headlight assembly is causing the error message to show in the instrument panel. They said they have shared the logs with VW Engineers and are waiting for a resolution. I got back the car yesterday and the error hasn't shown up again. But it looks like if the diagnostic error continues, they will replace the headlight unit under warranty. Has anyone else faced this issue with their Taigun? The annoying this is this - even with the tape, the door noises are back + all sorts of creaking noises from the internal panels, when the car is driven on bad roads (which is pretty much most of the roads in my office commute ). On smooth roads, the car is pretty silent but this is hardly a solace. The driver side window one touch fails several times. The ASC says it works just fine for them when testing. So I took 2 videos reproducing the issue and have shared with the ASC service manager and the advisor. I shall update here as and when I have more news. That said, I have a couple of questions. 1. Is there any undercarriage protection that we can ask to be fitted separately to cover the engine bay and a bit more from underneath? The roads where metro work is going on is giving me nightmares even when driving slowly. All sorts of jutting out iron bars, rocks and foot deep potholes on the road. 2. The My VW Connect app is acting weird. It does not connect when my mobile is on Wifi, saying ""Internet is not available"" but it works just fine when using it on mobile data.

If you prefer manuals, try pushing your budget and get the GT manual. Though this variant lacks some good to have features, it makes up with some useful features such as hill hold and Active Cylinder Tech. The engine has been a delight on the highways delivering effortless performance every single time. I have done about 5500kms so far and most of it on the highway. And the desire to get behind the Taigun's wheel hasn't subsided one bit. The gearing is just perfect aided with a good low end grunt. The result, fantastic drivability. You wont find yourself shifting very often. And, if you are conscious about mileage, you have some good news since the GT manual if driven with a light-foot delivers close to 17-18kmpl on highways. It can do even better if you have the patience to hold on to ~80kmph. The Active Cylinder tech works very well if you know how to trigger it which you will eventually. Overall, Im very glad I chose this over the 1.0. The only thing I really miss is cruise control, which Im planning to retrofit as in when I source it.

However, my view, based on 5600kms with my Taigun AT Topline, is that it is much better to go with RON95. It says so in the fuel lid that anything less than RON95 is for emergencies only and we need to switch back to RON95. I have experienced first hand noticeable sluggishness from the engine and lower fuel efficiency in the 3 instances I used RON91.

But I have realized, idling the 1.5TSI (At a signal, in traffic, waiting in the car etc) absolutely murders its fuel economy. Recently I have started using it (the start stop function) and only switching it off in critical situations as I see fit. I have seen a 1.5-2 Km/L improvement on my fuel economy post doing this. My question is: What impact does this function have on the battery and its longevity? I have combed the manual and there is no mention of how this function impacts the car's battery. Is it safe to use on a long term? I actually wince whenever the battery cranks the engine every few seconds, especially in peak traffic.

He did not mention any issues with AC however , hence posting queries here as I think his experience might be limited due to owning the vehicle just for a month or so I am one of the early owners (got a Nov 2021 model) of Taigun 1.0 Topline AT. And my odometer stands at 5944Km as of today. I have posted the review of the vehicle with sort of periodic updates on the mileage situation as well in this thread (VW Taigun 1.0L Topline AT | Ownership Review). So I think I can give a fair response to your query. As far as I know, the AC issue is not limited to Topline. There has been no fix made available until now, specifically for the older VINs. 7-8kmpl in bumper to bumper heavy traffic where engine has to idle at stand still for more than 1min at a time, is the norm. I had to change my commuting time to ensure that the travel time for 18Kms is ~45mins one way instead of 1hr to 1hr15mins in peak traffic. In a standard commute, I see my MID showing 11-12Kmpl rarely. Actual mileage is slightly lower than this number and is even worse with non-RON95 petrols. The higher mileage figures you are seeing may be because of any one of the following reasons. (a) Might be for a 1.5L GT version or the 1.0L with Idle start/stop feature. The car may or may have gone through the first full paid service too. I am not sure. (b) People may be reporting mileage from a less congested city (unlike Mumbai, Bengaluru or Chennai) (c) Many of the YT videos reporting mileage do so from highway runs, where mileage can be significantly higher depending on sections of terrain. For example, when I was descending from Yercaud hills, the MID showed 25Kmpl. The true mileage can be seen only from a long term tracking, which is what I have been doing in my ownership thread. I have shown even mix of distance on highways vs. non-highways I have driven. You can see the overall average mileage is only around 10Kmpl. Here's the link to my last update (VW Taigun 1.0L Topline AT | Ownership Review) from Sep 09, 2022. Hope this helps.", 15th October 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Chennai,324,"1,021"

1561, asmr , 18:45 ,BHPian,"1. Just wanted to post an interesting update. During my weekend trip to Madurai, I did not get any RON95 fuel. The bunks near my place were not having XP95. And I didn't have the mind to go out of the way to get Speed 97. The nearby BPCL outlet didn't have standard Speed too. The same was true for Madurai. So this entire trip saw me refill my car with normal petrol from BPCL. I was dreading the performance & mileage drop. I couldn't have been wrong. 5 people - 3 adults, 2 children (9+ yrs). 3 suitcases, 3 bags. Tyres set to 38(F) and 42(R). I got an average mileage of 17.7Kmpl on the onward journey. On the return journey, thanks to the wide open, empty stretches from Madurai to Trichy, a steady 80-85Kmph cruise saw my car touch 20+Kmpl for real! Here's a screenshot taken after driving 110km from our hotel in the southern end of Madurai. I had even driven to Vaigai dam on Sunday through 2 lane highways, with good bit of traffic and I was able to see 15+Kmpl on the instrument panel. The car was not sluggish but the ""pep"" you get with RON95 was missing surely. Just thought I will post this here, since I have been telling people to stick to RON95 petrol. I think it is still the recommendation, but on long trips, where RON95 petrol might not be available, I think we should be fine with good quality normal petrol IF mostly running on highways. 2. Also, since these are connected topics, I would like to bring the question up that I had asked several months ago. If anyone has had any luck with octane boosters in their Taiguns, I would request them to share their experience here. 3. During this drive, I did face one issue. The steering wheel, when centered (visually, aligning to the side stalks) saw the vehicle drift to the left. I then started noticing that I had to hold the steering 2 or 3 degs turned to the right to keep the vehicle straight. Is this the same as the left drag issue that people have been complaining about? or Something that got to do with wheel alignment? I had checked the tyre pressures and they were fine.

Yes, there's almost NO 95RON fuel pumps here in Madurai (though I've seen advertisements of it here, haven't seen an actual pump yet). But ever since I got my Taigun delivered (1.0 Topline MT), I have only been using regular fuel (91RON) and never have we filled anything else. Mileage on the city hovers around 12-14km/l with AC, which is pretty good for me. On highways, it's around 15-17, as we love to rev it hard when we find empty long stretches. By the way, we went to my dad's native for a visit today, and the roads were almost deserted, so we did some triple-digits (100-120kmph, though cruised at 90-ish when the road had other vehicles), and after the 60km to-and-fro run, the mileage was 15.7km/l on the display.", 25th October 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Madurai,16,57

1566, naadopaasaka , 09:34 ,BHPian,"Test drove both the 1.0L Automatic and the 1.5L GT Manual trims of the Taigun last weekend. I drive a 2016 S-Cross 1.3L MJD. The ride and handling of both versions of the Taigun felt very similar. The European firmness at low speeds was there but I can't really complain. The handling, though good, certainly felt like improvement from the S-Cross, but not a substantial one. I didn't really get to test it too much either at high speeds or on any challenging curves though. The heart of the matter is, however, the engine. The 1-litre engine has a bit of turbo lag. But when the turbo spools, there is quite a sprightly push forwards, and the power seems to hang around. It is exciting. There is nothing to complain about with the torque converter. The lag too isn't particularly annoying. The 1.5L engine, on the other hand, is an engine with class and finesse, but no pomp and show. The turbo lag is very well veiled and there’s always more power on offer than you need. For a turbocharged engine, the low range power is very impressive and the power delivery is almost linear. It feels luxurious. It yields to any demand without complaint. But it does not offer the lag-boost excitement. Some reviewers have complained of the clutch being heavy. From my limited experience, it certainly is not! It does have a weird motion though. There seem to be two stages- one until and just past the biting point, and a second thereafter when it almost collapses freely to the floor. There is much more travel after the biting point than you’d like. I found it easy to adjust for these issues by pushing the seat a little further back, because you’ll never need to depress the clutch fully to the floor anyway. The manual gearbox is good. Short throws, slots effectively. On both cars, the steering feels a little lighter than comfortable and also lacks a little feedback. The experience of the test drive was interesting. I called up Volkswagen Mount Road - Sundaram Motors and told them that I’m not from Chennai and so may not make a booking there. (I was only there on a trip for a few days.) Despite this, they were welcoming and keen to offer the test drive. They also said they could register the car temporarily in Chennai and that they could deliver it to me in Chennai only for me to get it registered in Bengaluru. We’d scheduled 1500, but the SA called and said the car wouldn’t be available then. He asked me to come between 1530 and 1600 and suggested that 1600 would be better. So I went at 1600. The SA informed me that the car would arrive soon. So I spent some time looking at the Taigun GT display vehicle. The delay in the test drive car arriving turned out to be a good thing because I spent a lot of time looking at the display vehicle which was an unbooked vehicle ready for delivery. The rubber beading on the b-pillar on the right side wasn’t properly nestled into place and was deformed. Resultantly, the driver’s door wouldn’t open and shut without some force. How did this vehicle even pass QC? 45 minutes in, the test drive vehicle hadn’t come. So the SA offered me a test drive or the 1.0L automatic. That’s how I got to drive both.", 29th October 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Bengaluru,70,285

I don't understand this ""price increase with feature substitution"" approach Welcome to the forum! It's good to know that VW's finally giving ventilated seats to the GT Plus variant, but still dumbstruck to see them remove Auto-ORVMs from it, albeit charging a higher price! Anyways, if you get this variant, you can probably ask the dealer to retrofit Auto-ORVMs back to the car, if you need them. They cost Rs. 15,000 (May vary per dealer) additionally, which is bothersome, especially when someone buys an already overpriced car. Or, if you don't need that sweet and peppy 1.5L and would have a pretty good 1.0L engine, the Topline variant has all bells and whistles for a lower price, including Auto-ORVMs and Ventilated seats.", 30th October 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Madurai,16,57

Buying journey Even before test driving anything, my heart always wanted Taigun or Kushaq. The car that I’ve driven the most in my life (7-8 years) is the Polo, so I had a soft corner. However, the AC issues were a deal breaker. I could deal with break noise or creaks, but not a sub-optimal AC in NCR summers (GT+ was out of my budget). Broke my heart, but I proceeded with my search. My search started with Nexon EV max but couldn’t justify spending 20+L on a car which I would be hesitant to take on trips. I would definitely jump on the EV bandwagon for my next car when the whole ecosystem is more mature. Then I was very seriously considering the City VX CVT. However I just didn’t see myself in a sedan yet. I find them too long for city daily commute. The car was perfect otherwise. Head said yes, heart wasn’t set yet. It stayed in the consideration set. Then I was in a phase where I thought spending upwards of 15L on my first car was too much so started seriously considering Magnite and Kiger. Ruled out Kiger coz it doesn’t have ESP (safety was my top criteria). Magnite, again, just couldn’t convince myself. Seemed like I was settling - the interiors were too drab, Nissan's focus on India was unclear, the quality/fit and finish made it clearly seem like a sub 10L car, I would have gone for the turbo CVT variant. Considered Hyryder strong hybrid for a brief period, but mid variant on road was coming above 18-19L. Then I also realised it’s a) bigger than what I’d like for city use b) underpowered for my taste. c) most importantly had a 6 month waiting which I could not wait at all. At this point, I didn’t have a clear winner in my mind. I was reading posts, watching videos, going through forums all day long. The clincher was when Taigun and Kushaq got the safety rating. Around similar timeframe, the news of all the issues getting resolved also started coming in. AC software update, creaking noise clear fix etc. And then i took the plunge Why Taigun over Kushaq? 1. 10 inch infotainment with Wireless CarPlay 2. Subjective, but exterior looks. I like the tail lights, and the front is very nice and timeless 3. Have a polo in the house and have had a really good experience thus far 4. Also subjective, but interiors. The floating infotainment seems like an afterthought vs the well integrated one in VW 5. digital cockpit. Super minor reason, wouldn’t have minded the analog one too How's the experience been so far? Overall, I'm loving it. Pros: 1. Drives like a charm. Lovely steering (light at low speeds, weighs up well with speeds), good turbo range (kicks in around 1700-1800 rpm), confidence inspiring breaking 2. Really good visibility - coming from a Polo, I can see more of the bonnet 3. Enjoying the frills - lovely 10inch screen with seamless wireless car play, ventilated seats work well (less noisy than what people have been saying on the internet), auto dimming IRVM, auto headlights, digital cockpit showing me techo, speedo and bunch of trip details in a beautiful layout. All this adds to a nice well-rounded experience 4. The transmission is really smooth. No one can feel the gear changes. I don't even know how perceptible would DSG changes be to me after this...but I've not been pushing it so far, so I'll hold full judgement here. 5. Decent suspension. You feel the bumps, but even above 40-50kmph, it takes them into its stride really well. I would take this + stability over a bouncy but soft suspension 6. Feels solid. Everyone in my family who's seen it and played around has said this. And this is after everyone having driven or used the Polo. The roofliner is sorted now. The dashboard while hard plastic, feels solidly built. Signature door thud (bliss!). 7. Good NVH levels (mind you, I have not pushed it beyond 4K RPM yet so don't know how thrummy the engine can get) Cons: 1. Man, I hate those touch AC controls. Have already pressed the defogger button multiple times while changing the temperature. The system in Polo was perfect - simple display with tactile rotary knobs. Simple button for Auto AC. 2. This might be placebo and no one else has noticed, but I thought I heard fainnnttt creakiness from the left door. This doesn't have the door beading tape installed yet - will anyway get that done at the 1K check-up/service. That's it! I legit don't miss or need anything else in my car. It has all the creature comforts for me, and satiates my moderate power/thrill requirements. Would I have loved the 1.5 more? For sure! Would I have wanted to pay 3-4L more for a <5% use case? Nope. Also considering DQ200's history, I'll sleep more peacefully with this gearbox+engine combo LMK anything else that anyone else wants me to comment on, I'll drive it a bit over the next few days and can come back and answer those questions.", 7th November 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Delhi,6,17

1585, Atharva14 , 23:02 ,BHPian," 6 MONTHS AND 9000KMS UPDATE Update 1 Well, it really has been a great drive so far for me. Many road trips and daily commutes have really been a joy. However, during my last trip to Konkan, I happen to hit a deep pothole at almost 50-60km/hr. Knew something is wrong and within a few meters got the deflation warning on the cockpit. The front left tyre got a cut on the sidewall (not repairable). Changed it with Stepney and carried on with the journey.TPMS error. On a break, I happen to notice that the rear left tyre also has a bulge on the sidewall. Badluck max. Contacted a bunch of tyre stores in Kolhapur for the available size but Volkswagen decided to put such a unique size(205/55 R17) that it is hardly available! Also being a Sunday, VW Kolhapur was also shut. Risked it and carried on with the journey to Mumbai at a speed below 80km/hr every time. The next morning visited VW Autobahn(Goregaon west). Advisor advised me to change the front left with a new one and to claim warranty for the bulged tyre. My car has MRFs and they're the worst in warranty processes. Obviously, the warranty claim was rejected, and had to pay for both tyres. Also, the advisor checked for any strut leakage and alignment. Found everything to be perfect. Drove almost 1K kms after that no issues. Update 2 The other and most common issue with VW 2.0 cars is the auto-up-down feature of the driver-side window. That thing really has a mind of its own. sometimes it works, sometimes doesn't, and sometimes it does the opposite of what you do. I'm on my third power window motor now(1st changed due to faulty, 2nd changed while adding auto fold mirrors). The issue starts to persist again and this time I really want a robust result. Went again to the service center, Mr. Purshottam( Asst. Service Manager) promptly looked into the matter and kept the car for a day, and did the necessary changes needed. The Window Lifter was changed this time under warranty. The motor remains the same. A great experience as always at the workshop(Vw autobahn Goregaon). Mr. Purshottam looked into the matter carefully and gave me timely updates on the same. All warranty claims were handled by him and the part was also made available quickly. The car was washed and returned the next day. The auto-up-down works fine now and I feel the speed by which the window comes up has also fastened. Attaching a video for reference. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md0tzID9_Sk Update 3 Changed the fogs to LEDs! A simple yet tricky swap.

The TC gearbox comes with the 1.0 TSI and the DSG comes with the 1.5 TSI. I would suggest you test drive both of them and see which one you prefer more. Both the engine options are very good, but they have their own characteristic nature. The TC and DSG are very similar in performance. The DSG is obviously better in shift point and timing, but in isolation the TC is good enough. DSG concerns are a lot less than what they used to be a few years back. But they are not absent.

Unless there's some highway driving, no incentive in DSG equipped 1.5 litre variant over 1.0 TC from practicality point of view. Bonus : you can save some bucks !! 1) You will not use the power (150 HP) of the 1.5TSI in city. But power is not the main thing in this case, the torque is (250 NM). The massive amount of torque available makes the engine extremely easy to drive. You can drive the car in the city without any stress either on your self or the engine. I own a Taigun GT+ and I barely ever need to rev the car beyond 2000 rpm. The drive is effortless. 2) The ACT cuts in at any speed above 30kmph. Its pretty seamless and you wont notice it at all. Along with the idle start stop system you should get fuel economy in the double digits very easily. Truth be told, the 1.5 TSI is more fuel efficient even compared to the 1.0 TSI (ARAI rated). For a 150HP/250NM engine, that is remarkable. 3) You are right here. DSGs generally dont perform well in continuous and heavy bumper to bumper traffic. But there are ways to cope with such a situation (Going to manual mode, avoiding constant creep etc). The DSG is not a practical choice. The pros and cons of the gearbox are both substantial.

From my understanding, there was a coding issue on when the AC compressor would cut-off on low RPMs. Thus, people complained about the AC ""tripping"" during bumper to bumper traffic. Other than that, I found very few complaints of people not finding the cooling adequate if the AC wasn't tripping. There has been a SW update for this issued in September which claims to solve this tripping issue. AC compressor keeps running at idling RPMS of ~1K also. The compressor obviously turns-off if you have start-stop system switched on, so when the engine is killed, so is that compressor. I can corroborate that the AC on my Oct'22 1.0 Taigun hasn't tripped in bumper to bumper traffic. I can't comment on the cooling efficacy since Delhi temperatures are very mild right now, so AC cooling is barely needed. Guess I'll have to wait till March - April to know for sure.

But as the Taigun was released earlier, me and my family did get a lot of time with the Taigun and had gained a certain familiarity with the car. When the Virtus was launched, we did go to check it out, but found it cramped compared to the Taigun. Our feeling was driven by the higher seating position and airy cabin in the Taigun as compared to the Virtus. Do note that the interiors in Virtus GT are all black compounding the issue. I also liked the dashboard design of the Taigun more compared to the Virtus. I do have a tight parking spot at home and parking a crossover was going to be easier than parking a sedan. So overall even though it costed more, I still went ahead with it. Now for the objectivity Virtus GT gets ventilated seats, Taigun GT+ dint then (They seem to have fixed this difference now) Taigun GT+ has a color scheme which is more in sync. The interior door color matches the seats. In the Virtus GT, the interiors are all black but the door has beige on it. Looks weird. The Taigun GT+ gets an amazing off black color steering wheel. The Virtus GT gets an even better looking pure black steering wheel. The Virtus GT rides on 16 inch wheels which gives it better ride comfort. The Taigun GT+ rides on 17 inch wheels which gives it better handling and slightly reduced ride comfort. The Virtus GT gets a bigger boot (Due to it being longer and a sedan) So yes you have the subjective and the objective differences Cheers.

1612, Raastapopulous , 18:19 ,Newbie,"I purchased a VW Taigun 1.0 TSI MT Highline back in October and here is my ownership report: Why this car? I stay in Mumbai with frequent runs to Alibaug, where I run a restaurant. Hence I needed something which has good highway manners, a great built quality to last me a few years, decent ground clearance to tackle some of the rough Alibaug roads and compact enough to squeeze through Mumbai traffic and find parking fairly easily. The Taigun and Kushaq seemed to be the only cars that fit my bill and I preferred the Taiguns design and hence my money went here. Why the variant? It was purely a monetary decision, plus I didn't want the lower fuel economy of an Automatic. I paid 17.3 lacs on-road (Company reg + extended warranty + 5 yr service pack + complete insurance cover) Interiors and Features The interiors and features are a significant compromise compared to the Topline model (it also costs 2.5 lacs more than this one). The only feature I miss not having is keyless entry with push button start, I could live with not having a sunroof, climate control, cosmetic improvements inside and outside, projector LED lamps etc. The seats are fabric and are quite bad. It almost feels like how a low-quality cotton t-shirt gets very rough after years of hard washing. This is especially true of the center armrest where my elbow became red after a long drive due to the rough texture grinding against my skin. The seats also absorbs a lot of dust, 2 days into taking delivery I smacked my seat and saw a cloud of dirt. I am strongly considering buying seat covers. The Android Auto / Infotainment software is a bit 'confusing' in some aspects. There seem to be 2 modes - one with Android Auto and one without, even though both do pretty much everything except for google maps navigation (android auto only). Switching between the two gets a bit buggy at times. There are moments when the connection suddenly stops and I have to reconnect my phone. I also found on multiple occasions that Android Auto causes my phone to freeze and eventually crash. I am not sure if this is a phone problem or a system problem, yet to try this on a different phone to check. There also is no option of answering calls from the steering-mounted controls, you have to take your eyes off the road and tap on the screen. This is a big miss especially since they have given buttons for stuff that didn't need steering-mounted buttons. The wireless charging pad is also very glitchy. It keeps throwing up an error that the charging pad has an object disturbing it, where there is nothing. I have tried removing my case, and cleaning the phone back and the charging pad but it still refuses to work. How does it drive? The 1.0 is a decent all-rounded engine that has good bursts of speed to overtake and has enough stability to easily cruise at 120-140 speeds. The ride is a bit stiff at low speeds but I find myself being able to drive over small speed breakers at higher speeds without feeling any sharp movements. The engine almost sounds like a diesel, especially in idle and lower gears. Most passengers immediately assumed I had a diesel. I am particularly not fond of the gearbox and find it a tad notchy. I somehow struggle to find 4th gear if I need to downshift from 5. The neutral point is not actually right above 4th gear, and is more between 2nd and 4th. I had a bit of a scare as well once when I was unable to do this and eventually started slotting into 3rd directly from 5th. The turbo lag gets a bit frustrating, especially if you want a quick overtake. If you are driving below a certain RPM in 2nd/3rd, it can take a second or two to kick in and suddenly you feel yourself getting pushed back into your seat with the burst of power. This is fun but can also get scary if you need to break suddenly. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this car. I may have mentioned most of the negatives than positives but I honestly feel this is the best multi-purpose car in the market. Small, but not too small, can tackle some rough roads well, good safety, decent engine, it seems to tick all the right boxes for someone who needs 1 car that can do it all. The only 2 things I would want to change - the terrible seat fabric and the addition of keyless entry with push button start. Else this car is perfect. I have already racked up 1200 km in 1 month and I am looking to do a lot more!", 12th November 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Mumbai,1,4

1614, MismatchD , 22:19 ,Newbie,"Hello everyone! I was planning to do an ownership review/mini travelogue of the experiences with our Taigun here, but something else was in store for us to face. A few days back, after having it idle for around a week, we turned on the car, and heard a loud beep followed by continuous beeps, with (almost) every single warning light on the instrument cluster on and the following messages: Of course we were flabbergasted, as the car isn't even 2 months old. Hopeful that it was just a glitch, we started the car, and everything seemed to be normal, until we put the gear on reverse. The parking camera didn't pop on the screen, and the steering felt heavier than usual. We drove it around and realized everything wasn't right, so we stopped and called the service center. In 15 minutes, two people from Volkswagen Madurai arrived and checked the car, and came to the conclusion that it's not possible for all parts to fail and the same time. They open the bonnet and look around and behold, a RAT NEST! Here's a picture of the rat nest (Discretion advised, could be disgusting to look at). Sorry for the blurry picture, the nest was inside the wiper frame, and I couldn't capture a good picture. Our SA told us that we could tow the car to the service center or have one of their service people drive it there. I didn't want to tow the car nor risk someone's life on a faulty vehicle, so the SA told us we could book a flatbed through roadside assistance. Did the same through the toll-free number and the flatbed arrived the next morning. And off it went to the service center! (Couldn't click a picture as I was away, dad took care of everything) Both the Sales Advisor and the Service Assistant were very responsive and informed us of every step they were doing. This car being our first German, I was quite scared thinking about the bill after reading countless horror stories about German car service costs. We were informed that only the wiring was damaged, and the final bill amounted to around 6000 Rupees, including additional requests like wire protection, rat repellent coating and car wash. This was a BIG relief, as I was expecting a way bigger bill. Looks like VW 2.0 is doing well on that part. We had the car delivered to us by this evening, with a perfect job done everywhere, especially the cleaning. Oh boy, I could never match that shine with my cleaning, experts are indeed experts. A big shoutout to Ramani Volkswagen, Madurai for their amazing and fuss-free servicing. Now that our Taigun is back to its former glory, is there anything I could do to protect it from future rat infestations? I would love to hear some ideas from the community.", 12th November 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Madurai,16,57

1623, captain planet , 00:02 ,Newbie,"hello bhpians! This is my first post on TeamBhp. Last year, I purchased my VW Taigun after reading through the forums for a long time. Thanks to all of you. Since, I'm one of the early buyers of the vehicle and a part of TAIGUN SQUAD (prebooked before price reveal) I think I can be of some use to other members in the forum. Here's the 1st service experience of my Taigun as it completed its 1st year in october starting.: About the vehicle: VW Taigun Highline AT purchased for 16,70,000 (14,10,000) from VW Indore with RTO regitstration and insurance. Appointment Indore has only one VW dealer & that is also the authorized service center. Of all people that I knew from purchase of my vehicle from VW Indore either left the firm or changed their number. And my home is 70 km from the dealership. So, I filled a form on VW website for 1st paid service. Surprisingly, nobody called even after 1 week. So, i decided to pay a visit to the dealership on saturday. Service advisors declined to service the vehicle asking to come after 3-4 days even after I told them about raising a serivce request. But somehow, the guy who actually does the servicing heard me outside saying to my friend (mail likh dete hain VW ko, team bhp pe bhi mention krdenge) & saw Advocate badge on the vehicle. He convinced service advisors to book appointment next day ""Sunday"". I managed to stay at somebody's house that night. Service: Next day I went to the dealer at 10 a.m. & asked the guy: to do periodic 1 year service. My fender got loose so asked them to tighten it. Rear seat belts were not buckling up because of the seat covers installed by dealer earlier. (leather top line ones) Horn upgrade creaking noise from center console (around gear knob silver part) loose lower window rubber beading & chrome garnish for the same window one-touch up-down not working install dashcam tyre inflator with auto cut 3m Anti rodent coating Out of these, they:did the periodic service. Parts used were: pollen filter, cleaner, lubricant spray, engine oil, oil filter, screw, air filter, another cleaner, antifriction tape. fixed loose fender, but put a small dent (sad) didn't pull out the rear seat belt buckles citing accessory guy is not available. very bad! horn upgrade - declined (due to warranty) didn't fix center console creaking & applied saint gobain tape instead (doors were already fine from day 1) Once again, they lubricated the window rubber and didn't replace the window winding motor saying part needs to be ordered. (did the same on 6 month service) No info for the dashcam & tyre inflator - accessories guy was not there and others didn't bother to provide information. Updated software (AC was already fine but is now super chilling) 3M Anti rodent coating - 3m guy present at the delaership did coating only on engine top. All wires at the bottom were left, wheel arches were left, didn't even bother to lift the vehicle to cover underbody wires. I realized I have been looted later after reading the 3m rat attack thread. Very very poor. Car wash - nicely done specially interiors! My experience I didn't ask (what & why) about any inclusions/exclusions in the sheet as I wanted to see what they do by themselves for the first paid service. Total bill for the 1st service was Rs. 3681 only with labour charges waived which was very nice! Surprisingly they used VW's LONGLIFE IV FE 0W-20 engine oil for my Taigun. But what I found weird and unexpected was 3M Anti rodent coating's charge of Rs. 1984. I didn't see the details at that time as the total sum Rs. 5666/- looked to me in the expected range & I was happy I didn't have to go back empty handed. But, later realized that 3M guy at the dealership didn't even cover wheel arches and bottom wires. So, I bought a spray myself later (rs.531 - amazon) and did it. Another bad thing I experienced is part availability for window winding motor - it has been almost an year and my window does not work. Yesterday I called them to place the order already so that next time part is already available but they told me, we can't order the part without your vehicle present here. So, they are asking me to visit again just to place an order and later visit again to actually install the new motor. Disappointing! Overall I found behaviour of the staff very ignorant because they are the only option we people have here. Here's a picture of squirrel attack on battery cover after which I ordered 3m spray: ", 23rd November 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Dhar,7,4

What's the practical fuel efficiency of 1.5 EVO & 1.0 TSI engines? Hi I was on the same boat 7 months back. I took the plunge since I was floored by the way the 1.5tsi drove in its manual form. 7 months and 7000kms later, Im certainly glad that I took that decision. Since this particular variant doesnt come with bells and whistles, you really get the time to appreciate the driving dynamics and simplicity of this car. As far as fuel efficiency is concerned, I get around 11-12kmpl in city driving conditions and 17-18kmpl (Maintaining 90-100kmph) on highways. But as you will know, turbo petrols are very sensitive to throttle input. Driving with a heavy foot (i.e even if you are just cruising at 100kmph with a heavy foot) can make the mileage drop like crazy. However, if you drive with a light foot, the ACT tech in 1.5tsi will take care of the fuel efficiency by deactivating two cylinders. The best I got on a 500km road trip with one passenger, a kid and packed boot was 17.5kmpl(Maintained 100-110kmph). The trick is to find the trigger point where the ACT kicks in each gear and keeping it activated. Its difficult to find that point at the beginning but in a matter of days you will get used to it. I suggest to use the current dynamic fuel economy view and then see how the fuel efficiency changes according to your throttle input and work your way up.

Hi, I own a Taigun GT+, purchased at a princely sum of 23L OTR. I would have given this deal a real real good look. BEFORE, rejecting it. A Taigun GT+ test drive car with 27K Km on the odometer, means this car was part of the initial batch of cars that were sent to dealerships ""Prior"" to launch. These cars were part of the VW campaign before launch where they had a road show through all major cities. These cars were put together by the VW Chakan plant before the official assembly line was operational. They will have all the initial concerns (Bad roof liner, fit & finish issues etc.) that our Team BHP review had highlighted. The above points are in addition to what our other members have highlighted. Do note that GT+ test drive vehicles are generally shared between multiple showrooms for a single dealer. The car's drive train would have already gone through massive stress, the body panels may have been painted/touched up multiple times.

Thank you all for your sharing your valuable feedback on this forum which helped me finalize this car. I have drive 230 kms in 10 days. This one came with smart touch climatronic AC. Delivery experience was smooth except from some delay from my leasing company's end hence a 18 day gap between PDI and delivery. I ordered mud flap, 3d rubber foot mats and rubber boot mat at the time of PDI however haven't received them till date. Looks like Volkswagen only wants to sell their accesory packages. Day one, changed the OEM Ceat SecuraDrive tyres to Continental UC6 in same profile. Bridgestone Turanza or Michelin Primary 4ST were not available in the same size or were more than 10 months old. I was quoted 8k each for UC6 (balancing included) and got 4.5k each for SecuraDrive. Total damage 14k. Only drove 20 odd kms on Ceat hence not able to make out the difference. Car has already made its first visit to the service centre. Tyre alignment felt a little off since the tyre change. Car was pulling towards left. After alignment as well, it takes about 10 seconds for it to start pulling towards left. Is it acceptable? Could hear some squeaking/rattling on rumble strips and bad roads from the front passenger side. I was not able to pinpoint the source. Service centre has spayed lubricant on rubber of all doors and boot on my complaint. Doesn't feel like it's completely gone though, will have to find the source and try to get it fixed.

All the parts and components inside the car are from the suppliers, some local, some imported, which are being manufactured well in advance in time. You don't even know the dates of their manufacturing. And cars when cared for last for 10-15 years easily. It's not like 3 month or a 6 month old car is not gonna last. You are right about cars being manufactured in advance, due to part shortage cars were manufactured in advance without electronic components, and when the parts get available, the cars are finished, tested again and dispatched to dealers. All the manufacturers follow these practices. Production is planned well in advance, so due to part shortage these things happen. I would suggest don't worry too much about it, you have 4 years of standard warranty, plus you can get 2 years of extended warranty. You can do PDI before payment too.

Is this the same as the left drag issue that people have been complaining about? or Something that got to do with wheel alignment? I had checked the tyre pressures and they were fine. Any guidance would be appreciated. This is a known issue on VW cars coming out of Factory these days. The Pune VW Factory either has a horrendous Wheel Alignmnent setup or the technicians performing the same are pathetically unskilled or just lazy. The fix is : 1) Get a Proper Wheel Alignment & Wheel Balancing from a reputed Shop in your locality and make sure they have the Values of VW Taigun stored/updated on their systems and not use the values of VW Vento/Polo/Ameo/Jetta/Passat etc. And, please make sure that the technician sits in the car while he locks the Steering Wheel to make sure SW is straight with respect to the driver, before he adjusts the Toe. If the SW is locked Off-Centre, the SW will remain Off-Centre after the Wheel Alignment. 2) Most important final step is to get the Steering Angle Sensor Calibrated at a VW Service Centre after Wheel Alignment which is absolutely necessary on cars equipped with ESC (Electronic Stability Control). This is to match the steering angle to the vehicle's new thrust line. Unfortunately VW Service Centres in India do not have enough knowledge about this and they don't consider this to be a necessity. Be adamant and get this crucial step done. It's done with a VCDS. Otherwise, your Steering Wheel will never give the intended feel and feedback with respect to the tyres. All the above steps will hopefully help in reducing the pull to a great extent on your vehicle.

So, I finally decided to go with the Kushaq 1.0 Ambition AT and took the delivery on 4 Dec. After considering and shooting down Hyryder, Creta, Seltos and Astor, it was finally between Taigun and Kushaq. My family liked and felt the Kushaq had better road presence and the tail-lights looked a little bit more matured. The small differences in the screen didn't really bother me. It was really difficult as the Taigun topline price was very attractive from a Hyd dealer with just a lakh more than the Kushaq mid Ambition 1.0 AT that I was paying for. And these were My23 models(Oct onwards). I didn't go ahead with that as we firmly decided on the Kushaq. I can share the details privately if anyone is interested. Drive Experience so far on the 1.0 AT was amazing. Should be on different on the Taigun 1.0 AT too. The FE is around 6-6.5kpl in the city and 12.7kpl on the highway as of now with 1000kms done. Heard from other users that this will improve slowly. The 1000kms included a drive from Bangalore to Hyderabad which was total fun without pushing it too much. Even after the long drive, I was comfortable and had no body pains. My parents who travelled along had no complaints too. The AC worked fine in the hot sun. The steering felt sturdy throughout and the braking was spot on (there were couple of occasions where I had to brake hard and the response was impressive). Initially you may feel the braking is too sharp. If you are driving it after a while, you may hear the brake noise for a bit, but after braking a few times, it disappears. It takes a bit of getting used to the car to brake smoothly. Thank you all again.", 22nd December 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,24,32
1665, deepakr , 19:33 ,Newbie,"Hi Everyone. This is my first post on this forum. I have been a silent reader for a long time and have taken a lot of help from this forum, during the purchase of my first car. I am considering the GT 1.5 manual variant. Have taken test drive of manual variants of both the TSI and GT models. Liked the GT variant better. I have never owned a VW and so need help with few things. 1) I have done long rides in the Polo 1.2 manual petrol in the past. While I really like how it drives, once we reach 3 digit speeds, the 3 cylinder engine makes a lot of noise. I don't find it very pleasing. Is it the same with the 1.0 TSI manual in Taigun? I did not get to drive it in an open stretch. So just wanted inputs from existing owners. 2) The GT variant that the dealer is offering me, is a January 2022 manufactured model. As per the sales person, they received the vehicle in September. A customer booked it and later cancelled, to go for the GT DSG variant. Considering all the issues which the existing owners have reported such as door noise, AC issues, poorly built roof liner etc. is it advisable to go for this somewhat old vehicle? Moreover the sales guy mentioned that, this is the same case with all the dealers, when it comes to the GT manual variant. All the available models in Bangalore are either Jan or Feb 2022 models. Either I can buy this now, or wait till next year January end, when the manufacturing will commence again, and there is a chance to get a newer vehicle(with higher cost of purchase of course). Will highly appreciate any help on these points from the existing owners. Thanks.", 23rd December 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,4,4

I have never owned a VW and so need help with few things. 1.The polo which you had driven had 74bhp and around 110nm of torque, even then it was underpowered. The one in 1.0 TSI Taigun has 115bhp and 175nm of torque. And the 1.5 TSI Taigun GT has 150bhp and 250nm of torque. Both of these engines are most the powerful, revv friendly and hoot to drive in their segments. People buy these cars for their engines and the performance they provide. So don't worry about the engines. If you drive them enthusiastically they will make a noise but it's a sporty one, most people enjoy that. On the other hand when the engine is only making noise and there's no power, that is when it's irritating. 2. A one year old car is not old if it's driven regularly and maintained, but a one year old car that has been sitting on its wheel is not a good choice, the tyres go hard, if it has been parked under the sun, the paint and the plastic trims fade and dry, the non painted surfaces rust, there might be some rat damage. Etc 3-4 months old should be the target, anything above that can be risky, until and unless the dealer is giving you a very good deal and allow you to go and check the car yourself, and only buy it if you are satisfied. Even then the tyres would have degraded a bit. My advice, go for a newer unit, or ask the dealers in the nearby cities about the GT manual.

You are contemplating replacing a Creta diesel manual with either a venue petrol DCT or a Taigun petrol TC. I would suggest to test drive the car and check whether you are fine with the torque characteristics of the cars first. Your usage does warrant a petrol though, but be aware that Taigun 1.0 TSI will probably return single digit mileage as well in Mumbai traffic. Demo cars are always to be wary of. But take a test drive, physically inspect the car as closely as possible, and push for the maximum discount possible Cheers.", 28th December 2022,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,64,127

1688, RohanDeshmukh , 22:17 ,Newbie,"Background Having been born and brought up in a lower-middle-class family in Mumbai, we could not afford a car, nor did we need one given the awesome Mumbai public transport system. I never even learned to drive till very late in life. Many years later having moved to Pune (via Bangalore) with a family of my own, I was really scared of taking my newborn in PMC buses and autos. Time was ripe to buy my 1st car, which was Maruti Alto K10 , what else? Learned to properly drive this car and took the car all the way to Goa from Pune other than a few other trips. Dealing with Hinjewadi traffic made me a PRO After about 3.5 years, I realized that Alto was not going to be sufficient for us, as my son was growing up and upgraded to VW Ameo, Highline, and Diesel. SA from VW brought an automatic vehicle for the test drive as the manual one was not available, and I was hooked on it. Personally, it was by far the best decision w.r.t cars as it eased my daily commute. I had tried a few other vehicles, but there was something about VW, which clicked and I purchased Ameo. In 6 years and 60K, I took Ameo on road trips to Indore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, and Goa other than numerous trips to Mumbai from Pune. Ameo was regularly serviced and tyres were changed at 50K Present Day By now, my son has grown up to a 9 YO. I am now a petrol-head and so is my family, esp my son. We are really interested in checking out new vehicles and were turning our necks at the sight of a new car. There were numerous occasions of considering a change in the car, inviting a strong rebuttal from the wife, as Ameo was still good and can serve for a long time. But, due to eternal inquisitiveness, had test-driven XUV 700, KIA Seltos, Nexon electric, and Skoda Kushaq, and nothing was looking like a perfect replacement for AMEO. Of course, I was very excited about Taigun and had seen its launch LIVE on YouTube. Was very excited about Taigun, when I saw the 1st one on road. My mum has been complaining about ingress and egress from Ameo being a bit of pain off late, with age. We used to see numerous videos on YT about Taigun and also its comparison with Creta/KIA. 5 Star rating for German twins was the icing on the cake. Cut to mid-Dec 2022. VW (BU Bhandari, Pune) completes annual servicing and sends a brochure /advt of exchange offers for year-end. I casually call up VW and check what the offers are. BU Bhandari, Pune was quick to respond. SA called up and they arranged for a test drive immediately. It was a GT Plus 1.5 TSI Petrol vehicle and it was as expected comfortable to ride. I found the interiors better than that of Skoda Kushaq. My mum found it easier to get in and out of Taigun, compared to Ameo, which had sealed the deal anyways. SA was cheerful and assured that the best price will be given for Ameo for exchange and additional discounts of Loyalty Bonus, Exchange bonus, and corporate bonus will be provided. I was earlier given a quote of about X Lakhs for Ameo, during my visit to another VW showroom (close to 6 months ago) to check out Taigun (didnt test drive then as it wasnt available). When the SA asked for my selling price, I quoted (X+1) Lakhs. A senior evaluator was sent promptly to my house to evaluate the car and the price they offered was (X+2) Lakhs, which was a pleasant surprise that sweetened the deal + bonuses. On Road Price of TAIGUN 1.5 TSI GT Plus AT was quoted to me at Rs. 229843. Stars aligned. Wife relented. Colour was selected as Carbon Black Steel after much discussion within the family and VW Taigun 1.5 GT Plus Automatic - Carbon Black steel was booked. SA from BU Bhandari/VW was really helpful in the entire process and aligned very well and was a pleasure to deal with. I went for PDI (using the Team-BHP checklist) after it was brought in the warehouse. SA himself drove me to the same and I met with mechanics there, who were already working on upgrading and working on my car. This was the MY23 with Ventilated seats. Ameo was picked up from my house exactly 6 years later (27th Dec 2016 - 27th Dec 2022) and we went to take delivery of Taigun on 29th Dec 2022, a day after our 12th anniversary. It was a smooth process throughout and absolutely no hassles of any kind from SA and/or VW. I think we in Pune are blessed to have BU Bhandari chaps as dealers. In my association with them over the last 6 years, I never had any issue with them and that is also another reason to confidently go ahead with Taigun, besides obviously liking the drive and feel of the car. I did not buy the accessories pack from VW as none of them were useful, IMHO. I purchased the floormats from them separately, which I found were of the best quality compared to the ones I saw in the few accessories shop near my house. Also purchased a car door protector strip. After bringing it home, I sent it to 3M Car care, Baner, Pune for a Ceramic coating and part PPF (Paint Protection Film) and was happy with the outcome. I was satisfied with the service I received from them too. Thus having bought Taigun partly for my mum and family and partly for the driving pleasure (with all the latest technologies, which weren't part of Ameo) with the heart winning over my head I look forward to longer ownership of Taigun and many more road trips! P.S.: This is my first attempt to write a longish (purchase) experience. Excuse me for any mistakes.", 4th January 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Pune,23,32

Thanks and Regards I have quoted a couple of posts this every thread related to the tyre upsizing just for context and reference. I have not come across any posts from Taigun owners on upsizing their tyre but here is one post (koda Kushaq 1.5 TSI MT Ownership Review | My Crossover Story) from Jan 03, 2023 where a Kushaq owner has done the upgrade to 215/55/R17 and it seems to be working out just fine after driving 5K Kms on those. Given Kushaq and Taigun are almost exactly same in terms of design and spec, I would think that upsize would be fine to do. But just curious, any specific reason as to why you wanted to upgrade the tyres? My Nov 2021 manufactured Taigun came with MRF Wanderers, and as of yesterday I have driven 8.2K Kms on those. I haven't had any major concerns but doing turns at slightly higher speeds felt less confident in the early days. Given the state of roads in Chennai interiors, I was contemplating downsizing to a R16 but decided not to do that for now. Quote: Originally Posted by asmr Hi all, Quick question.

Using this chance to bump up my previous post with a question on the light pattern to see if anyone has any feedback. I also have a general question for all members. I seen a few posts on people upgrading their headlights, fog lights, tyres, adding extra horns, adding noise reduction pads in the doors, adding tints to windows (this is more about legal issues) etc. Wouldn't these impact warranty? With a 6yr warranty in place, I don't know if I would want to risk voiding warranty on a few parts (or the whole) by making such changes but that's more due to me not being familiar with such things.", 7th January 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Chennai,324,"1,021"

1697, OceanWaves , 15:03 ,BHPian,"For the GT Plus variant with stock tyre size of 205/55/R17, seems like a good tyre upgrade would be 225/50/R17. Checking the differences between these 2 tyre profiles using the tyre size calculator tool, this upgrade fits perfectly technically. The tyre height, wheel size, and sidewall height are all the same. The tyre width has been changed from 205mm to 225mm, tyre circumference from 2065mm to 2063mm, revolutions per minute from 779.4 to 780, and revolutions per kilometer from 484.3 to 484.6. No change in speedometer difference for 20, 40 and 60 km/h and very minimal change for the following speeds : 80 - 79.9, 100 - 99.9, and 120 - 119.9 So looks like this tyre upgrade should work perfectly fine for the Taigun.

1700, TheGearBox , 22:36 ,BHPian,"So, I got a Taigun 1.0 MT Highline in November last year. It is a September 22 manufactured unit, so it misses out on auto climate control and auto wipers. I'm facing a couple of issues in the car. I took it for the 1 month check up last week and reported the same to them: 1. Whenever I press the clutch, I feel the car jerk forward. This happens mostly while shifting between first, second and third gear. According to the service center, this is ""Normal."" 2. The driver window going halfway up and then going down while the button is pulled up. Nothing was done about this. 3. Squeaking noise from brakes at low speeds. They suggested cleaning of the brakes for this. 4. A faint rattling sound coming from the glovebox. It becomes more pronounce if there are contents inside. Forgot to report this one to them. Another issue I'm facing (might not be an actual one) is that the doors don't seem to shut unless you slam them with some force. I haven't had to slam them so hard in the Polo or Jetta.

I know an owner who has upgraded to this size and reports improvement in stability, breaking and cornering. Hi pannags, I thought this tyre width was a typo (225 instead of 215), but guess I was mistaken! I did check the upsize calculators and it's zero variance in height as well as circumference. This would mean the variance in speed/odo would be non-issues as well. An extremely small reduction (0.01mm or -0.23%) in sidewall height, which won't be a problem too. I would assume it gets a much stronger stance visibly. Would you happen to have any photos of that car? And given the previous concerns on max tyre size allowed by design, is there a way to know if there are no issues when steering is turned to either side to the extremes too? I read elsewhere on our forums that any such change would impact warranty for those assemblies. So I wonder if that risk is worth it.

They could have at least made the stock tyre size as 215/55/R17. There still is no proper clarity whether its safe to upgrade the stock tyres from 205/55/R17 to 215/55/R17 or 225/50/R17(this size is technically best up size for the stock 205/55/R17 tyre profile).

1713, drive.helios , 14:22 ,BHPian,"Thank you, dear admins and mods, for granting me membership to this esteemed forum! I have been an avid reader for the past year, ever since I caught the bug for a new car. Allow me to introduce myself and share a review of my beloved ""Helios"", our VW Taigun 1.0 Topline AT. For most of my life, I was a bike guy, even though I had my driver's license for nearly a decade. But then, the pandemic struck and I found myself back in my hometown of Kannur, Kerala, after spending the last 12 years in Bengaluru. As I began to venture out in my trusty Tiago, I started with short trips and gradually worked up to 200+ km drives. This was partly because my usual ride, Jasper, a 2014 Royal Enfield Classic 350, was stranded in Bengaluru and I had to get it shipped and repaired (a story for another time). I spend my daytime as Product Owner for a Petro-chemical Major's IT wing and nights as a wannabe poet. I enjoy good food - some of our future trips will thus be food tasting I wish, literature and talking, apart from biking and being on the road. A couple of accidents (was hit by a bike that did not have the headlight on while crossing the road at night, another time an Uber car jumped the signal at a 4-way crossroad and T'd me and Jasper all the while the traffic cop has stopped the traffic from that end and it was a Go for me) and covid had slowed me down. I'm a newbie car owner/driver, and hardly have got my hands dirty, I trust the service centers / FNGs to get this done, but I compensate for the lack of such expertise by being a super careful and sedate driver on road. Often, I'm the last driver to pass through a congested road or in traffic. Fast forward to 2022, when I asked my best friend to marry me - out of nowhere, our lives changed! We were set to tie the knot in September, which meant it was time for me to return to Bengaluru. Until then, I had been on the fence about getting a new car, opting instead for the convenience of ride-sharing services like Ola and Uber. But after several frustrating experiences trying to book a cab, combined with the exorbitant wait times and prices, I knew it was time for a change. My then fiancé, now partner (""D"") and I love going out and taking midnight drives, and as the biker in me evolved to prioritize safety on long trips with a partner, we decided it was time to upgrade. We would end up gifting ourselves a wild cherry red Taigun 1.0 AT in August 2022. The selection process, but first the demands in no order: SUV preferred for visibility and driving comfort Automatic transmission Petrol engine with acceptable mileage Reverse assist with camera preferred 360-degree cameras optional Budget range of 12-16L, but also flexible to go up, with intention to keep car for at least 7-8 years Emphasis on safety, as car will be driven frequently Decent boot space. Delivery before Sept 2022. Our usage Pattern: The cars at our respective homes are only used for short city drive and occasional visit to relatives, hospitals and mostly cover 5-8K kms a year. With the new car, we do not foresee a lot of city drive but quite a lot of outstation drives. in the Last few months we have perhaps driven around 500kms in Bengaluru city and the remaining 6K kms are all outstation trips. we are anticipating a monthly usage of 1000-2000 kms, with a few vacation / road trip plans already in the pipeline. The car remains parked during the week days unless we decide to take a late/mid night drive. We do not drive for work. Cars, TD experiences and why we chose a Taigun: Tata Nexon: I had initially considered the Nexon as my first choice for a new car. I had a positive experience with the Tata Tiago and believed the Nexon would offer similar value for money and good build quality. However, my experience with Tata service centers (TASS) had been hit and miss in the past. Despite this, I had built connections with the local dealership and service center and knew the issues would be resolved. I also knew a few local mechanics / FNGs who could fix any problems with the car. The Nexon also has an AMT transmission, which my friend had recently purchased and seemed to enjoy. In addition, the Nexon had received positive safety ratings and I felt confident in its build quality. Despite not having test driven the Nexon, I almost convinced my partner to book one. Other Cars: My brother, who is a better driver and knowledgeable about cars, convinced me to test drive other vehicles in the SUV segment to get a feel for them on the road. This ended up being a great decision as it helped me make an informed choice. Tata Altroz: The salesperson recommended we try the Altroz, specifically in the MT guise. While I liked the car, I ultimately decided not to purchase it due to issues with visibility and confidence in the seating position. Tata Harrier: I did not initially consider the Harrier, but after test driving it, I was impressed by the 2.0 diesel engine and the car's strong road presence. Discarded as its a huge car, also a diesel one. Hyundai Creta and Kia Seltos: I test drove the Creta 1.4 DCT and while I liked the features it offered, I ultimately discarded it due to safety concerns and a long waiting period (5-6 months). The Seltos dealer gave us the GT top variant for a test drive and I was impressed by the features it offered. It was also a better car than the Creta under similar considerations. However, I had concerns about the maintenance of the DCT gearbox in the long run, along with their safety ratings. I had by then spent enough time in the TBHP forum consuming content. Two weeks after declining the Hyundai Creta, the SA called back to say that a Knight edition was readily available. I declined the offer and he then made an unusual request to book the car regardless and cancel it later, as he had not met his quota. While I felt sorry for him, it was not a wise decision for us and I politely declined. Another reason to discard the creta was the frequent face-lifts and we were told that seltos is due for a face-lift in 2023 as well. Hyundai Sonet: I did not test drive the Sonet due to safety concerns. Volkswagen Taigun and Skoda Kushaq: I was blown away by the 1.5 DSG Taigun, but it was beyond our budget. We test drove the 1.0 AT Taigun as well and were impressed by its refinement. Driving these two cars also meant we no longer liked the AMT transmission and head nod associated with them. The car was also smaller in size compared to the Creta and Seltos, which we liked. We ultimately decided on the Taigun due to its shorter waiting period (2 months) and other options discussed in the pros and cons below. We also considered the Skoda Kushaq, which had a similar experience to the Taigun but with a more subtle, less chrome design that we preferred. However, we ultimately decided against it due to a lack of service centers in my hometown and the need to drive 100+ km to get it serviced. MG Astor - never got the test drive scheduled. Maruti S-Cross - Did not do a TD as the SA confirmed the end of life for this model. Maruti Baleno - The new model ditched the CVT for an AMT, hence did not do a TD. It did fit a lot to the requirements otherwise. 360-degree camera, improved design language and perhaps the only car that has factory fitted tinted glass other than the XL6/Ertiga. Cars not considered : MG Hector: a huge car for a first time - full time owner. Mahindra XUV700 - long waiting period and budget issues Jeep Compass - beyond our budget Mahindra XUV300 - after Nexon's AMT experience, decided against AMT Mahindra Thar - not practical for us, but in the Wishlist for a future car. Maruti XL6/Ertiga - did not consider as they were a tad bit bigger in size. EVs weren't considered at all given both our home runs are over 350kms one way. Shortlisted car: Taigun or wait for 5/6 months to get Seltos and borrow our family car until then The Deciding call : Since my brother and I had been the ones test driving the cars, D and I decided to take a second test drive together to ensure she was also comfortable with the car we chose. We were unsure between the Kia Seltos and the Volkswagen Taigun AT, but ultimately chose the Taigun. There were both emotional and logical reasons for this decision. On an emotional level, the car felt good to drive and instilled confidence in me as a less experienced driver. We were also confident in its safety ratings. The dealership and salesperson's attitude were also important factors in our decision. The salesperson, Ashish, was patient and listened to our demands and concerns, and even brought the car to D's home for a test drive after reports of AC issues emerged. Overall, the way we were treated at the PPS Richmond Road showroom and Ashish's positive attitude sealed the deal for us. The logical reasons though defied our initial budget and we ended up paying upward to 20+L for ""Helios"", are listed towards the end. The booking & delivery experience: We walked in to the showroom on a day that seemed relaxed for them. We were greated by the gentleman who also became our SA and handled all the affairs from our initial visit to multiple TDs to delivery. We stated that we were looking for. The SA made a suggestion to select the 1.0 AT and not the DSG version after listening to our requirement and driving style. We complied. We wanted the Carbon Steel Grey color but was recommended to go with the Wild Cherry Red. We were informed that the Grey color fades after couple of years. The Wild Cherry Red was appealing as well, so we complied with this recommendation as well. Thanks to the various threads in this forum, I was very direct with my timeline and delivery requirements stating if it cannot be delivered before Sept 2022, we would walk out of the deal. If we cannot do a PDI before payment was initiated/settled, we would walk out of the deal. The SA complied and promised delivery by August 2022, and he came around it. Got the car delivered in the last week of July 2022. We did the PDI twice - at their Yard before disbursement of the payments and on the day of delivery. We were driven to the yard by the SA and given enough time to look at the car. The ODO was at 65 kms when we took delivery, I do not remember what it was when we checked the car out at their yard. There were no offers running in May/June 2022 so we negotiated on the insurance and they matched my external quote without any changes to what was covered. We did not also purchase the essential kit priced at 10K, but instead placed an immediate order at the service center in Kannur for few items that we wanted - specifically the mud flaps, read window blinds, car cover, and a dual horn. Collected and fixed them during the ""Swagat"" service. We did not spend much time there as this was more of a checkup and not a service. I will have to wait for the next service to comment on the service experience in detail, this one was trouble free. We asked for the 7D door mats to be installed and paid a discounted price for it before taking delivery. Again, did not negotiate hard. I had seen a few models in amazon and the price was matched. We were slightly disappointed at the way the car was presented even though when asked, I sought no special arrangements. I did ask that all plastics items (seat covering etc.) be removed. There were a few hand marks, dirt etc., which were cleaned promptly. We had carried sweets for the showroom staff and a small gift for our SA. We were kept updated all throughout the waiting period. I continue to have a cordial relationship with Ashish though he moved jobs.Ex-showroom price :16,89,900 Extended Warranty - 4+2 Years, No discounts SVP - 4 years, No Discounts Short Summary of the Car Specs & Observations on them Model: Volkwagen Taigun 1.0L Topline AT - absolute love the AT, we hardly notice the shift ups/downs. Hoping to master driving using the paddle shifters/taking manual control. Have experimented it, the downshift to generate power is a adrenaline push. Engine: 999cc, 3 cylinders - Peppy, confidence inspiring. have not let us feel like like we should have gone for higher displacement. Max. power - 114 bhp @ 5000 rpm - pulls along quite well, as mentioned earlier faints above 150kmph, but dont foresee us doing it again. Max. torque - 178 Nm @ 1750 rpm - the initial torque available is fantastic. Took us a couple of days to get used to it. Brings a smile on our face every time we drive out. ARAI Mileage - 16.44 kmpl - Currently average mileage is around 10.2KMPL. have see the lowest of 7 and highest of 16.9 so far. Dimensions (lxbxh in mm) - 4221x1760x1612 - smaller than competition, but we love it. Kerb Weight - 1275kg. Love the planted feel this adds, along with other dynamics of the car. Ground clearance (unladen) - 188mm - scratched the bottom twice, once on an unscientific super high bumper and once on a broken road in the ghat section. Brakes - Front discs, Rear drums - super confident, and the drums work well enough. What we liked and considered as pros : Helios drives so well and effortlessly that we do not notice it touching 80kmph or move until the chime comes on. we have to enforce restrain ourselves to slow down. The ease of driving an AT and the above-average ride quality. This car is a pleasure to drive in the highways and really saves the left knee in Bengaluru traffic. The on-demand power surge is addictive. We hardly use the S mode but we do the Bengaluru - Kannur via the makkuttam ghat road at least once a month and it's where it really is fun. We also do the Palakkad-Coimbatore-Bengaluru route on our return leg and enjoy the benefits of cruise control. We were fortunate to take the new Bangalore Mysore highway for few stretches when it had initially opened and pushed the car to its limits. The 100-110 kmph range in cruise control is the sweet spot. The car tugs until the 140+ easily. Anything beyond seems demanding. We clocked 175kmph and decided not to repeat. This was attempted on an empty stretch, with enough visibility upfront but in no way is recommended. Convenient features such as cruise control, ACC, automatic headlights & wipers, and a cooled glove box, which have all been used and found to work well in the first 6500 km of ownership. The smaller size compared to other cars in its class which makes it easier to maneuver and park also the design language that has sharp lines, an upright stance. The well-contoured seats with sufficient thigh support, although they are not suitable for a third passenger in the rear. The good front visibility. The cornering lights are quite handy and substitutes okay for the white LEDs at times. Touchscreen infotainment is very good. Sound quality is decent enough. We are not audiophiles but have music playing in the car always at the lowest of volumes. The sunroof, albeit small makes the cabin airy. The ventilated seats. What we wish were better in this car: The AC. We have a Tiago and Altroz at our respective homes and when compared, the AC is an underperformer. With just two of us onboard, we keep it at 22-23. With more people in the rear, we have to reduce further to 18-19. The lack of 360 cameras in this price range. Not a deal breaker though. The passive TPMS. The AC controls. This duty is now designated to the co passenger and not the driver, not intuitive at all. The windshield and side windows - not tinted and the heat gets through. Couple this with the underperforming AC and it's a struggle. Sunroof mechanicals - an eyesore when opened The wireless AA disconnects randomly or hangs The empty barrel in the headlight cluster. We don't drive long distances in the night but have found it to be inadequate when the vehicle in the opposite side has a better beam. The rear wiper feels cheap The dummy sunglasses holder. The reverse assist camera quality is not up to the mark. The IRVM/ORVMs are one size smaller. It serves the purpose after taking a while to get used to. Ownership experience until now: The car continues to be a pleasure and we have driven over 6500kms now across South India. The engine noise gets into the cabin. I did not notice this until a while ago. But this is a sweet note, and I have come to enjoy it, especially when we accelerate a bit more. We always have music playing in the car, so it helps to mask this to an extend as well. We have a few more trips planned for 2023 and hopefully will make them come true. We got almost all the chrome parts wrapped in matt black. I'm considering painting them black after a few months, D disagrees on spending unnecessarily on Helios. We are trying to use the cruise control as much as we can in highway drives. The average mileage in Bengaluru hovers around 10-11kmpl in bumper-to-bumper traffic with the lowest so far being 7. Otherwise, we get around 12-13. On highways, without CC we clock around 14-15 and with CC 15-17. We drive with the AC on all the time. We do let my brother and cousin drive Helios occasionally with the mileage dropping to 12-14kmpl on highways. Clearly, the car responds to how you floor the pedal. Unforeseen issues faced so far: Third day after delivery, an activa fell in love with Helios and crashed on to the rear. Minor scratches which we decided not to fix for ""Drishti"". No time was wasted in getting out of the car and arguing with him. The infotainment system hung once - fixed itself after engine was shut down and restarted. The defogger didn't work and in fact made it worse - had to roll down and drive for a while. Issue not reproduced. Driver side window one touch doesn't always work. Hit or miss. Scratched the left rear door and the right front bumper to a gate. My fault as I was preoccupied in thought as I started the car and panicked. Somebody left another scratch mark on the rear door by slamming their door to ours while parked at the Inox Galleria mall. I'll get this fixed during the 7500 kms service. I have a minor OCD and the itch is really bad. A dog crashed on to the front right-side bumper on a highway run. We were blinded by a lorry in the right lane. Fortunately, the dog survived, Helios did too. Had to replace the right fog lamp as its clips broke. We asked for the car to be picked up from our place of residence and dropped back after getting it fixed. Owning the tiago had given me enough wisdom to request that no additional work be done without my explicit consent. The car was dropped back in the same day evening. The rest of the parts didn't suffer any damage. We are sedate drivers and this was something that couldnt be avoided. Read about the horrors of such hits later and consider ourselves lucky. Filled Diesel instead of petrol accidentally - we always fill XP95 or from the reliance station when we travel to Mangalore and avoid everything else. If we are in Kannur and is driving south - we drive to Mahe and tank up. This unfortunate day, traffic was redirected and the immediate next station was seeing rush that they didn't expect. Even though I had got out of the car and told the person to fill XP95 - he filled diesel. Noticed it when approximately 5L was in, cut it off at 8L as I took some time to process what to do and called for RSA immediately. We were on a long drive and did not want to risk it. The pump owner offered to call local mechanic but we knew that we had to get it to the authorized service center. This was at 2300kms in the odo. We neither started the engine nor allowed anyone to do it and waited for 90+ mins until the tow truck arrived. Not starting the engine saved us the service cost and warranty I think now. We got the tank, fuel pump and spark plug cleaned, refilled and took a test drive and set off for the rest of the journey. The pump owner paid for the service and petrol. I did not find the need to penalize him more. He did ask us if we would take lesser money. Since I had explicitly stated to fill XP95 by getting out of the car and walking to the attendant, I politely told him that if I do so, and something happens in the future, I'll regret it. The service manager at Phoenix VW Calicut was very approachable. We found his number from the dealers' website and appraised him of the situation. By the time we reached the service center, folks were informed and they worked at the best speed they could. It took three hours for us to resume the drive. We were told to drive without caring for milage and burn as much as we can. So, for once, we filled any petrol we could and drove away. Once we reached Palakkad, we switched back to XP95. We have not faced any issue so far because of this mayhem. While I now ask the attendants thrice to fill petrol and is a little paranoid, the experience has not deterred my love for the car or driving. What next for Helios: The 7500km checkup is due. Hoping to do it in January itself. Will get the paint fixed this time. I have spoken to drcodemyvw to get few items coded but have not been able to. I need to find some time to work with him and get the usuals done. Replace the rear wiper with the one from Polo.** Install a dash cam. I have shortlisted viofo A229 duo for now with the parking surveillance hardware hit. Drive a lot more, responsibly, safely. VW on a response to my tweet confirmed that a phase 1 solution is now made available for the AC performance issue. I'll get this done during the 7.5K km checkup. Not considering performance tires at this point. Wishlist: I'm not a fan of aftermarket customization of physical parts. I try to run everything as they come. We opted for an XZ+ Tiago for the parents because of this. Opted for Topline AT for the same reason. But I do want to make a second exception for an aftermarket headlight unit that gets rid of the empty barrel. This is the only time I wish if we had opted for the Highline Variant and swapped the units to aftermarket solution. But the other features were on the no compromise list, so we stuck with Topline. Where I need help/guidance from the forum/other owners : Is it worth doing a PPF or ceramic coating on the car? A friend recommended Kriti car care ( also read here in the forum) but I've been in and out of Bengaluru for various personal reasons and never quite visited them. (The cost is exorbitant for PPF, I can actually paint over the scratches once a year, but the OCD for clean cars is quite high) The windscreen and windows are a pain. We do not drive long distances in the night. Is it worth getting the tints (CR70/Ice shield) ? I know it's illegal but placing convenience over the fine it may attract. Suggestions on fixing the dash cam with the hardwire kit. Is it recommended or not? As i wrapped up writing, i realized that all the pictures have been clicked in my head, and not really in my phone. Nevertheless, adding some of them from our Dec 2022 drive to Gandikota. Helios needs a wash now, and i can possibly click some pics after.

Yes, I thought I had bookmarked a thread where an expert from the tyre industry (who is also a member here) had posted on guidelines for pressures for tyres based on whether they are cold or hot. They had also mentioned that it is always better to have a higher tyre pressure on bad roads to avoid damage to the wheels.

1728, shashank511 , 19:17 ,Newbie,"Last month I purchase a Wild Cherry Red Taigun GT+ MY23. I wanted to upgrade from Baleno to compact SUV segment (not sub 4-meter) and my final shortlist was Kushaq, Taigun, and Seltos. Many folks out there always have this question Taigun or Kushaq. I hope this blog will help them take a decision. Let's start. My priorities - Good looks, great to drive, both engine and dynamics wise, space and practical, and decent feature list. Above all, safety. There are more models available in this segment including Grand Vitara, Hyryder, Creta and Astor. First, let's talk about how I eliminated them one by one. Didn't even bothered about MG. MG belongs to SAIC group which is a Chinese state owned company, and I know we will always have some dependency on them when it comes to commodities, I don't want to relate with them on such a large scale. Have even stopped using Chinese phones or any other major devices. P.S: I am not judging anyone who buys Chinese products, everyone has their own personal preference. Next, Grand Vitara or Hyryder. Anyone who is looking for these can easily take a decision based on the brand they trust and the look of both. These two differ very slightly only in front looks, and rest is exactly same. From engine tuning, to suspension, to interior, etc. I went to Nexa once, just to check the Vitara, and it surely is a good looker with plenty of features. But I was never interested in either of them, purely based on two reasons 1. Hybrid, I am not currently much confident in, besides it eats into boot space. And the 1.5NA mild hybrid is a very dull engine for car this big. Even hybrid I have heard in many reviews is good till around 80, but slows down when achieving express way speeds. 2. Rear space, leg room wise I felt was slightly small, even though it was not a deal breaker. I am tall guy. Now, lets come to Seltos and Creta. These two share similar platform, but come with biggest differences when it comes to sibling rivalry. For me Creta was instantly eliminated, because personally, I don't like its look. Even though its interior is really good, and is feature packed. Seltos, for me is a good looker, is feature loaded and good to drive. Some prefer Creta in terms of features, but I think Seltos has more useful features, four sands apart when compared to Creta - 360 camera, lane watch camera, hud, and telescopic steering. I can easily trade panoramic sunroof and electronic parking brake for those. Seltos 1.4 Turbo is a good engine. DCT gearbox is fast, ride is stiff, handling is good, steering ok. Stiff suspension does give it decent body control, but ride I felt was very harsh among all the ones which I took test ride for. Creta on the other hand has slightly softer suspension, making a bit more body roll, but much better ride. Also Seltos is a good looker, but its very common on road these days and doesn't stand apart. I know it would have had a great after sale experience, but for me the real kicker was safety. Everyone knows Koreans have heavily compromised on structural safety against their international counterpart, and hence an average 3 star GNCAP rating. Now comes in Kushaq and Taigun. Lets talk experience one by one. 1. Design - I like design of both car, they look more crossover than SUV but for me its not a bad thing. I prefer rear of Taigun in comparison to Kushaq though. 2. Engine - I test rode 1.5L with DSG. Both excellent, best in the segment. Fell in love with it. Upgrading from Baleno, it was a huge difference for me. I also drive my father's Verna 1.6 Petrol(121hp) a lot, and even compared to that it was a huge step-up. 3. Ride and Handling - Very good. Its obviously not sedan like, but is really good for a crossover/SUV. Suspension is bit stiff. Low speed ride feels a bit harsh, but high speed stability is good, and the occupants movement on undulations is very well contained. The car also doesn't bounce much, I think the suspension rebound is very nice. I felt Kushaq had slightly plusher ride. Not a huge difference though. 4. Features - Both have good amount of features but competition is slightly ahead. It was not a deal breaker for me, but I would have loved powered seats, 360 camera or at-least front parking sensors, and adaptive cruise control. ADAS in India is currently not a priority for me. 5. Safety - No debate, 5 star, for both adult and child. Shows how far they have gone in ensuring structural safety of the vehicle. Was one of the prime deciding factor for me. 6. Practicality - Space all around is very good, except the rear middle seat. Its best for kids below 14 years of age. Legroom is very good, front and back, and the boot space though not class leading, the way its designed can take in lots of luggage. Don't go by numbers here. Both Kushaq and Taigun hands down are best in performance, dynamics and safety in this segment. Looks are subjective, and feature is the only area where the are slightly behind. Its not a deal breaker, as they come with plenty of good and useful features like Wireless android auto, and apple car play, auto start/stop, ventilated seats, sunroof, cylinder deactivation, etc. Now finally the reason why I chose Taigun. In terms of driving experience I felt Taigun gearbox was bit smoother and quick, and Kushaq's ride was slightly more plusher. The difference was not day and night, and both are felt only when driven one after another. But this was not the obvious reason I went with Taigun. There were three main reasons why I selected it over Kushaq. 1. I loved the tail light and the front headlight design. Even though the second barrel is a dummy, overall it looks good, and comes with LED turn indicators in comparison to Kushaq which has halogen one. Also the interior color of Taigun including seat color I found more appealing on Taigun. Kushaq has a dull grey color on seats which I found a bit depressing. 2. Exclusivity. You can't tell Kushaq 1L and 1.5L apart. They don't have any difference in and out. I don't think its a bad thing to do a little bit of show off if you are spending more money on a bigger engine. Taigun has GT branding all around, and even the infotainment system displays it while booting up. Kushaq's monte carlo edition does have some exclusivity, but its very pricey for just a bit of cosmetic upgrades. 3. More consistency with the feature set. Kushaq 1.5 Style comes with digital instrument cluster, but its compromised on the infotainment system which is an older 8-inch one and even lacks wireless android auto and car play. 1.5 Style anniversary edition does have 10-inch screen, but has analogue instrument cluster. And monte carlo though has both again, the pricing for me was not justified. Taigun doesn't have this problem. It comes with both 10 inch screen and a digital instrument cluster. And MY23 is now coming with ventilated seats and rear fog lamp as well. So there you go, these were the three main reasons why I eventually went ahead with Taigun. That aside, these both are similar in almost all aspect and are excellent cars overall.", 22nd January 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Bengaluru,1,17

1732, jna4cob , 00:57 ,BHPian,"I was looking to buy a new car for my dad. The options we had shortlisted were VW Taigun, Skoda Kushaq and MG Astor. MG Astor: Not a great experience with PPS MG Motors, Coimbatore. I called them to book an appointment. After around 5 calls, they finally answered. Said that their sales representative will call me back. No response. I called them again, a person answered and said that they work till 6:30 p.m. I said that I will visit by 5 p.m. and I will call before starting from home. To my surprise, when I called them at 5 p.m., they said they are closed for the day. The executive said that they will call the next day and fix an appointment. No response after that. I went and raised a request for test drive on MG India website. No response till date (for more than a month). Verdict: Dropped MG from the list. If their sales is so poor, I cannot imagine their service experience. Skoda Kushaq: Had a very nice Test Drive. Loved the 1.0 TSI Petrol Automatic. Performance was not as good as the DSG but first-time automatic users would like the gearbox a lot. 2-spoke steering wheel was cool. Excellent driving dynamics. Had a pleasant sales experience at SGA Cars with Mr. Santhosh. VW Taigun: This was the best part. Excellent experience. I reached out to them on a Sunday morning. Prompt response. We were very satisfied with the approach of Mr. Praveen, VW Coimbatore. He came to our location the same day with a TD car. We said that we wanted to try the automatic version too. He took us back to their showroom in the same TD car and offered us another car with automatic gearbox. Was very patient in explaining all the features. Offered a really good discount too. We had planned to exchange our old car. He got in the old car evaluator on the same day and offered us a very good price along with exchange bonus, insurance, loyalty, and corporate discounts. All of this was done within that Sunday. On Monday we got a call from the banking team for the required documents to process the finances. They were very prompt and super responsive. Was extremely satisfied with their sales experience. This is what a salesman should work for - Close the deal as quick as possible. And now about the vehicle  Taigun in red was super impressive. Good driving dynamics. Ok-ok interior plastic quality (when I compare it with my Rapid).

I had asked for the battery to be checked as I was seeing inconsistency in the status when I start the car evey morning. SA reported back saying the battery status is good. They did top up the engine oil but don't see it mentioned in the invoice to verify. A free wash was part of the check up, but not really good. Hand/smudge marks all over, water marks% swirls grim not drying properly. Helios is due for a bit of pampering and detailing for the interior, will perhaps give him another wash and polish while at it. I don't know what they did to Helios but on my drive back after picking him up, the drive was rather too smooth/soft. Next up : get in touch with drcodemyvw again and get the few tweaks done, possibly a 400x2 kms drive in 2 weeks to kochi and back.", 30th January 2023,volkswagen-taigun,KA01/KL13,90,135

If you have driven the car hard and the Idle Stop Start System (ISSS) kicks in, you should turn off the ISSS and idle the engine for 1 to 2 minutes before switching the car off. Conversely if you have done city driving where your turbo barely gets a chance to spool up and become really hot, you can switch off the vehicle immediately and you don't need to deactivate the ISSS before doing so.", 14th February 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Bombay,209,994

He contacted me last week saying that, VW is planning to stop the manufacturing of the GT 1.5 manual variant. It is not yet officially announced by VW, as multiple dealers have still unsold 2022 vehicles. After which, most probably company will announce it. This is what the sales guy mentioned.

1780, thirdmainroad , 16:56 ,BHPian," My previous car was a Honda WRV 1.5 Dtec, and I really liked it. I found it to be peppy enough on the highway, liked the way it handled, and was most impressed with its milage, and I've juiced well over 30 KMPL over 100 km many times, though I usually would get 19+ on the highway - I drive 90% on highways. Every 3/4 years I get the itch to upgrade, and I had done over 80k Km in 4 years on the WRV, but was still very happy with it, and I had spared no expense to make sure it was in tip top shape. But come a Sunday in December, I was bored at home and with no thoughts of upgrading, I waltzed in to a Skoda showroom, really to kill the afternoon and I test drove the Kushaq 1.5. Man, I loved that car instantly and had to have it then and there. My wife was dead against an upgrade, but I argued that since we take long drives all the time, it'd be good we have a bigger auto that she could also drive - she drives an Ignis AMT, and though I would have liked to get the Kushaq in manual, I knew that would be the ONLY way I'd get her to agree. So I paid the advance amount, and came back home to research more on the car. What I did feel even on the initial test drive is that the Kushaq has a very soft suspension which is great for sitting in the car, but not for driving. After reading a bit and calling a few of my friends, I decided to check out the Volkswagen Taigun. It did come with a stiffer suspension, and offered much better driving dynamics. It's handling felt much better, it braked much better. But my wife preferred the softness and ride comfort of the Kushaq, and after a few arguments, I called the Skoda showroom to cancel my booking. They were aghast. They couldn't believe I was going for the Taigun instead of the Kushaq. They really thought me to be mad and said everyone prefers the Kushaq over the Taigun, that its a bit cheaper, and that it has better everything, and begged me to take the Kushaq on a long test drive. I agreed and test drove it on a long stretch of the highway. And I felt the same again - soft suspension that was good for comfort but not driving. This leads to the car shuddering when one brakes hard at high speeds and it did not seem to corner and handle as well as the Taigun. The Skoda guys where shocked and had the regional manager call me. He swore that the suspension set up was the same on the Taigun and Skoda, but I certainly felt a difference and told him so. The manager then requested I wait a day and that he'd like to check the Kushaq test car I had driven. The next day, they got 2 Kushaqs for me to drive, the same old one I had driven - they had changed the tires, wheel balanced and aligned, and they also got a Kushaq which had done less than 100 km, which was to be their test drive car. Took both the cars for long test drive again, and felt exactly the same and told them so. They were convinced I was mad, and left rather disappointed. I started thinking that perhaps I was a bit mad (I mean I know I am little cuckoo for sure, and was wondering if I was imagining things) and I asked the VW guys to come back for a test drive. Told them what Skoda had done and that I was quite impressed with their pre sales push, and that I would like a long test drive to which they agreed. So took the VW Taigun on a 100+ km test drive on the ECR off Chennai. I no longer had any doubt. The Taigun did have a harder suspension setup, which leads to a stiffer and bumpier ride but which affords much better driving, braking and handling dynamics. And that was it, I booked the 1.5 DSG and I had the car delivered to me in about a week after booking. Once I got the car, man, I was and am obsessed with the way it handles. I had to get the 1000 km run in (which the manual specifies that one should do) ASAP so that I could unleash the car. I spent the 2 days after getting the car running it in on the ECR, spending the whole day going up and down and up and down. 3 days after I had got delivery, the 1000 kms was done, and it was due for an inspection service + I had reversed it into my wife's Ignis, which had led to the rear bumper of the Taigun cracking - but not a SCRATCH on the Ignis much to her amusement. Its weird how force works upon impact. The car took a week for it to come back as I opted for insurance replacing the bumper, and have since been finding all the possible excuses to drive it on long trips. I live in Chennai and I've driven to Coorg two times. I had to of course check how the car performs on hard ghat sections so did a separate trip to Masinagudi where I spent a day going up and down the Kalhatti ghat below Ooty. I can't stop whizzing about the Mysore - Bangalore expressway - such a good road that and only going to get better once they ban autos and motorbikes - set to happen on 12th of March when its officially inaugurated. Now clocked 7300 KM in just over 2 months (with the car staying in the workshop for a week + me having to go visit the in laws in Rajasthan for 10 days - I of course wanted to drive, but the wife argued she couldn't take 4-5 extra days off work so had give in and fly) The car has gone for it's 7500 km service today - the guys at VW were rather astonished that it was in this early and asked me if there was an error on when I had taken delivery. I am to go on a drive either to Thekkady or to Aqua Outback in Tutticorin - the gulf of Mannar tomorrow. (Have any of you been there? I live like right NEXT to the sea, and I am not too sure of going to a beach vacation, but I thought I'd learn to angle fish there but I am not sure it's worth the 11k per night they charge.) This trip is going to add another 1k + km on the odo and I thought I'd give it in for inspection service 200 km earlier rather than 1000 km later. So here are my observations: One of the major reasons I upgraded was really safety. I always thought Honda will do well on the safety front, but with the WRV getting the dismal safety stars in the recent NCAP tests, scoring just a tad better than the Marutis, I had to let that car go. The Volkswagen Taigun 1.5 GT DSG is a FANTASTIC car to drive. Though I thought I'd miss manual, the DSG does a great job at shifts. The car handles exceptionally well at high speeds and on ghat sections, corners great, has no body roll and is just a dream to drive. The engine is very peppy, does prefer a tad bit of a linear acceleration, but does well on sudden and hard accelerations too. The car LOVES to be driven hard, hates city traffic. You can feel the car PLEAD to not be driven in city traffic. This is not a car you want to get if you drive in the city much, or are mileage conscious. Milage in the city will go down to as low as 7 KMPL in heavy traffic, otherwise around the 9 KMPL mark in moderate traffic. I wouldn't be surprised if people in Bangalore get like 4-5 KMPL. On highways, you can juice 20 + easily, but have to be sedate, which if you like driving you'll find very, very difficult to be in this car. When you floor it, expect around 12-14 kmpl returns. Pro tip: Sign up with the Indian Oil rewards program, and get some rebates when you book a gas cylinder or such. I got Rs 523 off a Gas cylinder recharge for spending 1750 Indian Oil points I had accrued filling in XP 95 over the last two months! Note: The car does perform better - power and milage on XP 95. Haven't checked out Speed 97 yet. Been toying with trying XP 100, but its like Rs 50 more than XP 95 at Rs 160 a liter! You hardly ever need to use the paddle shifts. Sports mode is great for quick overturns and bursts of acceleration. The car of course handles and drives much better in sports mode on the ghats. Niggles Hated the delivery experience of Sundaram Volkswagen. They deliver new cars in an used car showroom of theirs, and its a very off putting experience to get a brand new car in an used car showroom. Wrote a stinker to VW on this. The auto start and stop is very sensitive and will kick in even when slowing down, not having to halt. In bumper to bumper traffic, it kicks in all the time. I wonder if its ok for the car's engine to start and stop as much as it will in heavy traffic and if that increases wear and tear on the engine + battery + actually decrease milage when engine fires up often. My friend argues that VW would have kept that in mind when designing the function and that it is a made for India car. I avoid city drives as much as possible, so I am not going to look this up too much. I hate the fact that the car came with Ceats. My other choice was MRFs, and I hate them even more. This car needs to have come with better tyres. I can't wait to get on Michelins, but was/am cash crunched with this impulsive and unplanned buy, and also spending on constant road trips. I figure I'll wait till I cross 15k kms and switch to Michelins. Yes, I am a total Michelin fan boy! https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/tyre-...michelins.html (Why I will never drive with any tyre other than Michelins) I wonder if it would have been better for the car to have rear discs. The car does have a lot of power and will hit triple digit speeds very easily. The cars brakes are more than sufficient and it does hold nicely, but I still do wonder. I test drove the XUV 700 as well before booking the Taigun, and it comes with rear discs and brakes PIN POINT! But I disliked everything else about it so wasn't an option though I must say the braking on that thing did make me think twice on if I should pick it up. I do not like the music system at all. The head unit is great - much better than the 60 k Pioneer I had on my WRV, but the speakers to me suck. But that's probably just me. I love Hi-FI Audio, and for the set ups that I like, it costs 5-7 Lakhs for cars. Have to wait a bit for me to get that cash, and I'll be making a beeline to Speedfreaks in Chennai to get an Audio upgrade, hopefully very soon. I found the 125 + KMPH sound chime driving me absolutely mad. The car comes with a chime at 80 kmph which is once every minute, which is actually good as you cannot feel the speed in the car, and the chime is unobtrusive. It then has a 120+ KMPH chime, which of course is constant, but cross 125 KMPH, it gets LOUD and maddening. 5 minutes and Rs 2000 at Vagmaster, Velacherry, Chennai had the 120+kmph chime be history. Essentials - Sun films. I drove the car for a few days without Sun films, and it was horrible. too much glare, too much stress on the AC even though it was early January. I have come to learn that Sun Films are THE MOST important investment on a car, and choose the best and most expensive - Solar Shileds Nano ceramics.

And even though you have the option to switch auto on/off off, and I don't drive in the city much, AND I have dealt with dead batteries in the part, I picked up a Jumper Cable https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07...?ie=UTF8&psc=1 A Tow Rope. A friend in a Nexon and me found a way through a forest on to the banks of the Cauvery and we drove right to the river rather foolishly and got ourselves stuck in the slush. I managed to get un stuck - with more power than the Nexon and with Traction off, but the Nexon was stuck hard. But luckily while we were dealing with this - it was late night, another Nexon popped up and did exactly what we did and got stuck exactly how we were about half a KM from where we were, and they called in a Bolero to pull them out and they pulled my friends Nexon out as well.

They just felt that it looked nicer (the front chrome moustache on the Taigun was poorly received) and felt better on the inside. So we got a Red 1.5 Kushaq DSG home. It is a very hard choice between the two and you can't really go wrong either way. These twins are, hands down, the best driving cars in that segment. The discounts and the 4 year maintenance package sweeten the deal. I share your concern on the start-stop issue, so I switch it off the minute I get into the car. It might affect the starter, it impacts cooling which is poor to begin with and has minimal impact on improving fuel efficiency. I'm hoping there is a way to switch it off by default by coding.

Thank you Ranjit, and congratulations on yours and wish you the very same wholeheartedly. Same with the wife, and perhaps even me when it came to the exterior design. She preferred the front of the Kushaq when compared to the Taigun, and both of us the rear of the Kushaq which we feel is simpler and nicer. The interiors, I did prefer the Taigun, I must say! I didn't like the way the the HU was jutting out in the Kushaq, and didn't like the Monte Carlo excess red one bit! Driving was THE most important thing for me, and therefore the Taigun. Would have picked up the Kushaq if the drive was identical, for sure. I did worry about the front grill of the Kushaq, thought it would be like a whale shark going over the oceans with its mouth open for krill, with dust on our roads. Do tell me please, whats the milage you are getting on the Kushaq? And yes, you can change the settings of the Auto / on off to default off using code and OBD device!

When I take off on long drives, I don't really like taking breaks - even short ones and prefer to keep going. But when my wife is around, I am forced to break for loo and other pit stops, and have done 12+ hours with her two times. I personally think the car and the seats have been engineered for long drives. I have found the front seats better than the WRV - that is really something, for Honda really does it's seats well. I really can't sleep in cars - that's what makes me a good long distance driver, but I've slept like a baby in the Taigun when my wife took it over a few times on long drives. I've taken old people on long drives as well - my father - who loves to travel, and another who has a Innova Crysta - who doesn't like long drives. Both have commented on how the slightly firm seats left them much less fatigued than normal. The seats, especially the front, are really well suited for long drives, in my opinion. As for the AC trouble, this something I've read repeatedly but not something I've really experienced. We use the air con a lot at home, and when I am in the car, its on all the time. We like it cold, not merely a few degrees colder than outside. The air conditioning is really quite good in the Taigun! When its really hot, we go on LO for about 30 mins, and then its between 20-24 degrees. On long drives, 20+ really makes it cold, and we have switched to 24 degrees many times!

It so happens that the weather in Chennai has been changing from hot to pleasant rapidly in the past few days but on my office commute today, I felt that the ACC did a good job compared to my previous experience. I didn't have to start the seat ventilation. I will wait for few more weeks to pass final judgement on the AC fix that has been done. The driver window one touch seems to have been fixed for good in this update. I checked it several times and it didn't fail even once. Hopefully it stays that way. On the toll free number topic - the last 2 times I called them to either clarify something or register a complaint, they simply created a ticket that is passed on to the dealer. My impression is that VW customer support is basically a paper pushing organization and not meant for serious query resolution. The only good thing that happens is this: when the dealer/service center is assigned the issue via VW CS team, the CRM team at the dealer end springs in to action. I was even told, albeit in not so many words, to reach out to them directly and not bother with the VW support team.", 20th March 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Chennai,324,"1,021"

1825, omranga98 , 11:40 ,BHPian,"Took my Taigun 1.5 DSG on a 1650 Km Road Trip Ft. Mini Review/7000 Km Update But first, here is a little back story on why I got the Taigun over the others. So in short, i really wanted to get a FAST turbo petrol before the whole EV scene. Generally we keep our cars for 7-10 years so 2022 seemed like the perfect time. The price segment i was looking at (18-22 Lakhs) had/has a lot of options but here is why the others did not make it to my garage. Tata Harrier/Safari Reasons for not getting either: a) Too big. b) Did not want a diesel. c) It is a Tata, so it is given that it comes with a few free add-ons like poor QC, everything in the car feeling unfinished and the horror ASS stories on the forum itself. MG Hector Reasons for not getting this: a) Too big. b) Soft suspension setup = a very comfy ride. Sometimes i crave this in Taigun but then again, i was not looking for this. c) Petrol being unpowered and pretty fuel inefficient. Hyundai Creta/Seltos Reasons for not getting this: a) Did not like both the cars. Creta stills looks odd (borderline ugly), Seltos just did not feel like the car i would want to drive as my last non-electric car (probably). MG Astor Reasons for not getting this: a) Even though i loved the interior and the red colour scheme, 1.3 Felt unpowered. The car generally did not feel that good to drive and that robot thingy on the dash kept staring and intrupting me like a kid wanting your phone at a family function. Virtus/Slavia Reasons for not getting this: a) Was not launched yet. b) from what i had heard, it was supposed to be reaaally long. Which could be a problem. Skoda Kushaq Reasons for not getting this: a) No virtual cockpit. After driving the Taigun, i really wanted this. b) The interior quality was more creeky than Taigun and felt a level below. c) Boring rear end. VW Taigun Seemed like the perfect choice. Here are some pros and cons after driving for about 7k Kms. Pros: A) 1.5 TSI Evo engine paired with DSG is a gem to drive. Be it at city speeds or out on the highway. It never fails to bring a smile on my face! B) My car is manufactured in April 2022. It was the first batch where they improved the headliner, removed the red inserts in the dash from the silver colour and got the folding ORVM back! C) ACT or active cylinder technology works like a charm. It switches from 2 cylinder to 4 and back to 2 without a hint. The only way you know the switch is when the virtual cockpit indicates it. ACT makes the 1.5 more fuel effecient than the 1.0 TSI. At city/highway speeds when the car feels it can do with half the engine at work, it switches seemlessly. D) Fuel economy: Not a very important point for me but for people who are curious here: In city moving traffic, the car gives about 12-15 kmpl. In bumper to bumper situation, i have seen it drop to as low at 8-10 kmpl. Out on the highway with cruise control, you can very easily get 18-20 kmpl out of this. E) Paint quality is great IMO. I had initially booked white but changed to silver after i saw it in flesh. I think it looks lovely and really helps pop out the creases and design lines. GT plus comes with black roof. F) Comfortable seats: The side bolsters keep you in place, the cushioning is spot on. Driving 300-400 kms in a stretch is never an issue. Although i could use a little under thigh support. G) The interior lights: GT Plus comes with red interior ambient light across the dash while all the buttons are backlit with white LEDs. One of the coolest moment for me after puchase was finding out that there were small LEDs inside the interior door handle. None of the reviews had mentioned this. The interior looks so good at night! G.1) Interior shot at night: G.2) The light inside the door handle: H) Big enough interior space. Although i have never been driven around while sitting at the back, my parents and friends appriciate the leg space and the comfortable seats. The list can go on and on but let us keep it to this much for now Cons: A) The interior quality could be a lot better: For a car that costs upwards of 20L, the interior plastics creak. Whenever i take the car out, for the first one or two bumps, you can hear the dash and the AC controls area creak but then it stops. It almost feels like the plastics expand and come loose (?) and needs a bump or two to fall back in place? I dont know if this makes sense. B) I guess you have already read/heard about this but only the driver side window gets auto up/down powerwindows and almost everyone has the issue of the window rolling back mid way when the auto up or down is triggered. You then have to half press the button so as to not trigger the auto funtion to put the windows up or down. From what i have heard, this issue has been fixed via a software update that i am get to get (7500 km service is due). C) and of course, the three magical ̶w̶o̶r̶d̶s̶ letters: DSG. Taigun comes with DQ200 gearbox It is a dry type gearbox that has left a lot of the owners dry out in the middle of the road. Now i gently brush off this when talking about, i smile a little but deep inside it haunts me to a point where if i have decided to start an SIP or an FD as a contingency fund to cancel out the expense that might arise (read: will arise) over the course of years. and yes, i did take the extended warranty! D) Plastics on the rear light bar: Although the light bar looks great at night, the plastics surrounding can get scratched very easily. The car is 11 months old and i have gotten the thing detailed twice but keeps getting micro scratches. Planning to get PPF done on this. E) Slightly stiff suspension and narrow sidewalls: GT Plus comes with 17 inch alloys. This makes the ride sort of stiff and a lot of bumps can make its way into the cabin. F) Low Speed + DSG = mildly annoying: As you list off the foot from the brake pedal, the car takes a good 1 second to start moving. This lag is something that i am used to now but it used to be very annoying. Also the gearbox does get a little jerky at low speeds. With that said: The car has now done about 7.2k Kms and i am quite happy with it. I recently did a 1650 km long road trip with my childhood friend in the Taigun where we drove from Kolkata to Puri and fairly deep into the eastern ghats! The car was lovely to drive! I will make a detailed post regarding the road trip perhaps later but adding a few shots from the road trip here! Attachment 2442943 ", 23rd April 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Kolkata,123,"1,376"

I had a chance to travel in the Taigun 1.0 Topline AT, and here is what I could observe from the 4 hour drive during a hot summer day, with temperatures touching 40 C.AC cools properly without issues in stop go traffic in manual mode, Temperature set to 20C, fan on level 4 When in auto mode, re-circulation ON, 22.5C set temperature (setting used for entire trip, except for first 10 minutes), cooling was good and temperature stabilized in cabin within 3-5 minutes, while traveling inside moderate traffic. Auto start/stop of engine was enabled and engine would cut out on stoppages after cabin had cooled down. When temperature was set to 23.5C, cabin got warm, and hence it seems like 22.5C is the maximum temperature setting after which hot air gets mixed from heater core. We covered ~120Kms round trip in 4 hours, average speed was 35kmph, the 70% of the distance was hilly areas with lots of climbs and downhill roads. Max speed attained was ~60kph and car shifted only till 5th gear and was mostly shifting between gears 2-4. MID indicated 12kmpl fuel economy, there were 3 adults and 2 kids and zero luggage for the entire journey. The car also had gotten the AC update recently from VW. Not sure if this made any difference to AC cooling performance, as there were no complaints earlier also.

1878, Osteon206 , 02:11 ,BHPian,"Hi everyone. Got the 45000km service done for my VW Taigun Topline MT two days ago. Along with the engine oil change and air filter change they also changed all four brake pads. Surprisingly Brake pads were changed just at previous service at 30000km in December 2022. When I asked how they might have worn out so early, I was told that there is a step in the disc and that if the brake pads wear out early again then next time I’ll have to get the discs also changed. Service plus brake pads plus wash and wheel balancing + alignment costed Rs. 16818. The previous service costed Rs. 12500. There were two issues - one was that the DRLs have started turning yellow, for this the service Center has apparently filed for a warranty claim and they said once it’s approved and the part reaches, both headlight assemblies will be replaced. Second issue is that the infotainment screen turns green or pink at times, as instructed by the SA I made a video of the same when it happened asking with the odo reading, vehicle registration number and VIN. For this they said the software has to be reset, I will be getting this done in the coming days. Along with the service, the AC software update and driver side power window fix was done. Fast forward to today night - some irresponsible teenagers hit my car with their nexon as per eye witnesses and ran away. They have reversed their car across the stretch of the road and slammed into the driver’s door. The restaurant owner came down and promised to give me the CCTV footage as soon as possible. Attaching pictures of the car. I’m in a fix as to whether to claim insurance or not. Either way I’m determined to trace the owner of the car that caused the damage - highly irresponsible for having run away without even apologising. A traffic constable turned up just ten minutes post the incident after somebody informed about the incident to the control room. The damage came as a huge shock considering the amount of care I give the car which makes the wife feel jealous at times. I still can’t come to terms as to how they managed to take reverse all the way across the entire width of the road and hit the car. The door mechanism is working, central locking is also working. The tint is holding the shattered window in place, so didn’t attempt to use the windows switches. ", 16th June 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Mysore,108,421

He was pushing me to change the discs as well, but I had a word with another service advisor and decided against it. Since I’m not good at the technical and mechanical part of the brake and since it’s the brake, I went for the change of the pads this time. Our usage is about 3000km a month. This involves a lot of ghat driving as well - that might explain the hard braking I guess. Also so far it’s been 16 months since I got the car. Purchased mid Feb 2022. On hindsight the brake pads look like they would have lasted longer than another 1500km. I should have been more careful. Have applied for the insurance to fix the door and window.

Maybe they are not trying to protect, it could be true that their cctv is broken. Have you tried to check other neighbourhood shops, apartments, traffic signals - maybe they have cctv and recorded the car details? If those nexon people dined there, maybe the restaurant has a copy of the bill and mobile number? If there was a toll plaza around, maybe they have records?

Also, confronting them alone, might not work. One other option is to go to the Tata service center (assuming there is only one in the area) and put out some feelers, and offer a possible reward, for any tips when a banged up nexon (of said color) comes in.

As for getting the contact through the bill, the MD point blank refused to go through the other cameras for the guest telling that since they don’t know which car it is, it’s impossible to tell which guest it may have been. All this somehow only points to them protecting the other guest - our guess is they are probably relatives or friends or children of friends. Anyway time to move on. @Tgo, the service guys have confirmed that work will be exactly what you have mentioned.

I have seen enough of such cases where these youngsters brags of driving under alcohol/over-speeding to his friends (& sometimes family members) who keep cheering on. In fact, I had a fall-out with an old friend few years back when his son jumped red lights with us sitting as passengers. The traffic police needs to really shake up such errant drivers as a routine.

Was very keen on driving the XUV700, but both me and my daughter somehow came back disappointed. Maybe it’s just because I am upgrading from 500, I did not feel any luxury in the AX7L model. The Sony speakers were not what I expected. Same evening drove the Taigun 1.5 GT DSG and was blown away. It is miles ahead. In terms of power/weight ratio, the acceleration was phenomenal. XUV700 was immediately dropped. It seems like a step down from XUV but I also have a 2022 Polo Highline and even that music system sounds better than what XUV700 was offering.

Sorry, I just saw your post. 5W40 is not for the current gen of TSI engines. The recommended oil grade is indicated under the hood. And the oil grade to be used for all 1.0 and 1.5 TSI engines is 0W20. Never give them any slack if they insist on using a different grade oil. Engine oil is perhaps the single most important consumable in a car. Next time be assertive about using only 0W20. I would recommend you to monitor the engine oil temperature with great caution. 1) Is it too cold? 2) Is it too hot? 3) Does it take too long to warm up? 4) How is the cold start? Because 5W40 is more viscous than 0W20. The ideal sweet spot for engine oil is between 90-100 degrees celsius. Again I'm not trying to scare you here but caution is recommended next time.

Much much better handling than the 700, more power on tap, much better driving dynamics, no body roll like the 700. One thing the 700 felt a little better with was in braking, with its rear discs.

Thats adds into my confusion between Taigun 1.0 AT and Elevate CVT Background : I drove my friends Grand Vitara AT (Mild Hybrid) and with 4 folks was finding it really difficult to overtake the trucks/trailers, so forget about cruising cars. I had to plan those well in advance and then work with paddles. This became really cumbersome, and I realized I was not enjoying my drive. No sure if that's the case only with that car but 102 BHP seems less. Then I decided I need an ""adequately powered car"" also my budget is 17L Exshowroom. So I cant venture 1.5s of Taigun or Seltos I understand Taigun is Turbo v/s non-turbo and gearbox difference. If a take a look at the specs the Honda has a few more horses and Taigun has 40 NM more. My understanding Honda will be have a slight advantage on ASS and reliability and city drives. However, if its performance will be similar to GV AT (Mild Hybrid). I will have to drop from my probables and go for Taigun Would love to hear some expert opinions here.

Comparing the 1.2 TSI in the Polo with the 1.0 TSI in the Taigun is not fair. The Taigun is 200+ kilos heavier than the Polo. It also depends on which AT gearbox you were driving. The DSG in the Polo GT TSI would obviously be better than the TC in the Taigun. The 1.0 TSI is a 3 pot compared to the 4 pot 1.2 TSI. Thus the refinement of the 1.0 TSI is less compared to the 1.2 TSI. Where the 1.0 TSI shines is in its torque characteristics. Compare the torque curve of the 1.0 TSI with the 1.2 TSI. And you will note the difference and come to appreciate why the 1.0 TSI is such a celebrated engine. Turbo petrols are thirsty engines and low mileage is part of the territory. It doesnt help that VW doesnt sugarcoat the mileage display either. Cheers. Quote: Originally Posted by Cadd7027 Would love to hear some expert opinions here.

The other is a small turbo petrol begging you to stay in the mid range along with a quick shifting Torque Converter. The only thing they have in common are similar power/torque figures.

When I took a test drive recently, Sales rep admitted that there were issues with the service before but it has improved a lot recently.

I would like to give my 2 cents. I have been a comparatively long time VW owner based out of Bangalore. I purchased the VW Polo 1.2 MPI in 2014 (Based on the PQ26 Platform), which I used for 8 happy years. Finally sold it in March 2022, as the 1.2 MPI engine just wasn't cutting it for me any more. I replaced the Polo with the VW Taigun GT+ DSG (Based on the MQB-A0 IN Platform) in May of 2022. And I couldnt be happier. Talking about niggles, there are a few to report. It does boil down to the basic differences between the 2 platforms (PQ vs MQB). We in India have been used to the PQ platform (Polo/Vento). The structure, design as well as functionality was similar. As far as I understand, VW has only used the PQ platform in the mass market segment in India since the launch of the Polo. So our benchmarks on what a ""Volkswagen"" should be are based on that platform. Now talking about the MQB-A0 platform, that's where we see the difference. It is completely different with respect to its structure/design & functionality. I have sat in the Taigun/T-Roc & New Tiguan. All based on the MQB-Ax platform. They are all similar in feel. That being said the Indian suppliers who are contributing to the Taigun (As its highly localized), are not up to the quality levels of the initial PQ25 yet. It shows in how plush the T-Roc and Tiguan (CBUs) are in comparison to the Taigun. The roof liner was shoddy on launch, they had fixed it by the time I purchased my GT+ The power window motors are too slow The driver side one touch up-down needed a service patch to work properly The steering wheel lacks essential buttons (Mute, Call Connect/Disconnect) The AC cooling is not comparable to other brands (21C in Taigun is 24C in my wife's Baleno) The seat upholstery is underwhelming and downright shoddy in some places. The seat cooling function is noisy I have heard (Even though my GT+ doesnt have it). The boot floor is extremely flimsy All the above point to a new/fresh baked product that needs further improvements. I am confident that the facelift will address most if not all of them. But its not a bad car by any margin. Its a safe car. I am happy to know that in the event of an impact, the body shell will protect me and my family. The car looks fast, feels fast and is fast. Its one of those cases, where the show matches the go. Actually I have shocked other drivers on the road with how quickly I can cover gaps. The engine is devastatingly good. Drive around town below 2000 rpm, no need to scare anybody on the road Find a rowdy driver on the road and an open stretch? Show them who is boss, above 2000 rpm The DSG gearbox is sublime. The shifts are imperceptible and right when you need them. Upshifts are quick to conserve on fuel economy and downshifts are purposeful on accelerator input. The Taigun in Sports mode is a different animal altogether. You can keep up with serious cars with serious torque very well in sports mode. The suspension is perfectly balanced, soft enough to be comfortable, but hard enough so the car doesn't bounce around at any speed. The ergonomics are perfect, everything is where it should be. The attention to detail is amazing. For eg, the USB C ports are backlit, to ensure you can plug in your devices properly in the dark. Contrast this with other cars where even the window switches some times are not backlit. The seats are firm but comfortable. The ICE is lovely and with Android Auto, extremely useful and precise. No bugs in it whatsoever. I love the ""White"" cabin lights compared to ""Yellow"" ones in cars in this segment. Gives it a cold/futuristic look throughout. This perfectly blends with the new steering wheel (Which I absolutely love) and the red ambient light. My core memories with the Taigun have always been with driving it. Confusing much bigger cars (Harrier/Compass/Innova/Fortuner etc) as to why they struggled so much to overtake me on the highway. Hitting 110 Kmph and realizing the 1.5 TSI is just getting warmed up. Now coming to the elephant in the room ""The DQ200"". Yes it has been a problematic gearbox. Mechatronics failure, multiclutch failure, entire gearbox replacement are the trending terms on TeamBHP. But it does feel like VW has made changes to it over the years to improve its reliability. The 1.5 TSI doesn't launch as briskly as you would expect. Looks like they have done this to reduce stress on the DQ200. The user manual mentions braking at signals instead of shifting to neutral. Looks like the gearbox coding has been changed to disengage the clutch on Braking. The gearbox doesnt keep switching between D1 and D2 in bumper to bumper traffic. Looks like VW prefers slipping the clutch in D2 compared to frying the mechatronics with frequent D1-D2 transitions. I still may have a DSG failure at some time, or I may not. But as of now I think the ""Probability"" of having a DSG failure is similar to having a similar failure in any other car. I can live with that. I still have extended warranty and engine/gearbox cover addon just in case. Manufacturers make mistakes, but they do learn from them as well. VW is still trying to leave the ghost of DQ200 failures behind. The Taigun is a car that wont appeal immediately to people. It has to be lived/experienced for one to fall in love with it. Difficult to do that, while looking at the brochure/trying to fit 3 people in the rear/reading about DSG failures or over a short/long test drive. But it deserves your affection, because VW delivers on its promise to you. A good looking, sophisticated, robust, safe car that is fun to drive. So there you have it, my 2 cents (Actually 5 cents, looking at the length of this post). Cheers.", 7th August 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,64,127

They are a ""Comparatively"" honest lot, do their job well and take care of all complaints (If any) in a timely manner (Routine maintenance gets completed on the same day). They occasionally try to push useless stuff on you, but will take it back if you insist. They do have a bit of a margin in their service quotes, but I willingly pay that because I know that all my issues are taken care of. Their mechanics though competent, are a bit dirty though and I have had cases of them mildly soiling my car seats. But overall I am satisfied with them. I bought my Taigun from PPS motors. Their sales dealing was extremely quick and efficient, and I had a good experience with them. I do not have service experience with them. I would suggest to try the one closest to you first. As Bangalore is a big city and getting around is painful. You can then see how things go Regarding resale, I dont have too much of an opinion.

I am glad to be of help to a fellow Bhpian 1. This is a difficult question to answer without knowing your current/future usage. Looking at your response, I think highway drives may be a priority? In that case going for the 1.5 TSI manual would be better. Less gear shifts and you get use that explosive engine to its full extent. City drives dont do justice to the 1.5 TSI. I barely can cross 2000 rpm in normal day-to-day driving with the GT+. 2. The recommended octane level for the 1.5 TSI is 95, though it can run on 91 octane as well. If you do go for the 1.5 TSI, I would suggest to feed it 95 octane as the difference in performance/efficiency/behavior is noticeable. Occasional suspect fuel should not be a problem, but you have to keep an eye on the fuel quality of the petrol you are feeding it. The 1.5 TSI is a highly specialized engine with very fancy high pressure fuel injectors. It is not a ""Fill and Forget"" engine. If you have regular highway runs on known roads, I would suggest having established CoCo petrol pumps for your car's fuel stops. 3. In short it has gotten better. I have answered this above in more detail above. Cheers ", 7th August 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,64,127
1951, petro_phoenix , 01:02 ,Newbie,"Hello BHPians, Requesting your 2 cents on a dilemma. This is a question I have also asked on the City hybrid thread. Context: I drive almost 20 km everyday in peak traffic (through HiTech city area in Hyderabad) with a monthly airport ride (70 km roundtrip) on the plush ORR. I am deciding between VW Taigun 1.5L DSG and City ZX hybrid. I'm currently driving a 2018 manual Jazz and while it's a great practical package, it makes me frown every time I see an empty patch and try to floor the pedal. So, having a fun engine-gearbox combination is an absolute necessity for the new steed. Some of the factors weighing in on my mind for both these are are: Taigun: Pros:On-demand torque on tapping the accelerator. Ride and handling of the Taigun, seems to be perfectly balanced between city and highway needs. 5* Safety. Cons:Given how I drive in traffic 90% of the distance, with multiple patches slow moving bumper to bumper traffic, DSG is the elephant in the room. Interiors that are designed for 2013. Only the design and feel. Not sure about the longevity, and future rattling. City Hybrid Pros:Hybrid technology which seems to give the best of both worlds, an EV-like behaviour in the city with an ICE-like range. The plush feeling as soon as I enter the cabin. Aspirational value of city while growing up as a gen Z kid. The hybrid seems to negate the rubber band effect, which was the only con of the petrol City CVT. Cons:Lack of exclusivity, with the City looking similar to Amaze. Lack of luggage space. I'd be making monthly airport trips with an extended weekend's worth of luggage for 2 people. The low seating will make me suffer from the high beams of oncoming traffic. City drivers these days seem to be using them on well-lit undivided patches, with no regards for the other bikers and drivers. Conundrum: While the number of reported DSG incidents seem to have reduced now, I'm not sure if that's true or the recent victims are just being silent about it, as they've signed up for the risk while buying. At this stage of my life and career, I am apprehensive to spend time on dealing with DSG failures and of landing in a spot where I don't have a car in my garage . Should I avoid having a DSG as the only car in my garage? Also, should I factor in the Honda hybrids being a new technology within India and the service engineers not being experienced to handle the issues?

Hello, Let me start with a disclaimer, I own a Taigun GT+ DSG. I have another perspective on your conundrum. The DQ200 failure should not be the only thing that you should consider, the incidence of which are decreasing but they are not at zero yet. Driving through 20km of peak traffic daily will murder your fuel economy. The GT+ DSG hates bumper to bumper traffic and you will get mid single digit mileage during your drives. I live in JP Nagar/Bangalore which has a hellish mix of bad roads and worse traffic. My Taigun returns 6-7 kmpl mileage if I drive around for an hour within JP Nagar. Adding insult to injury is the 95 Octane petrol that you will be feeding the 1.5 TSI which is 7-10% more expensive. I do empathize with you about open stretches of road, trust me I do. But your use case is going to be frustrating with the 1.5 TSI. On the other hand, I am not sure if the Honda City Hybrid can provide you with the torque hit that you will get with the Taigun GT DSG. I suggest getting a cheap beater (if you have parking) for your commute and getting the Taigun GT+ DSG for your airport/reasonable traffic drives.

I then shifted to Elite Motors for service and have stuck to them since then. I am going to them for the servicing of my Taigun as well. They are a ""Comparatively"" honest lot, do their job well and take care of all complaints (If any) in a timely manner (Routine maintenance gets completed on the same day). They occasionally try to push useless stuff on you, but will take it back if you insist. They do have a bit of a margin in their service quotes, but I willingly pay that because I know that all my issues are taken care of. Their mechanics though competent, are a bit dirty though and I have had cases of them mildly soiling my car seats. But overall I am satisfied with them. I bought my Taigun from PPS motors. Their sales dealing was extremely quick and efficient, and I had a good experience with them. I do not have service experience with them. I would suggest to try the one closest to you first. As Bangalore is a big city and getting around is painful. You can then see how things go Regarding resale, I dont have too much of an opinion. I see that the Polo is holding its value in the second hand market. It probably would hold true for the Taigun/Virtus as well? I am glad to be of help to a fellow Bhpian 1. This is a difficult question to answer without knowing your current/future usage. Looking at your response, I think highway drives may be a priority? In that case going for the 1.5 TSI manual would be better. Less gear shifts and you get use that explosive engine to its full extent. City drives dont do justice to the 1.5 TSI. I barely can cross 2000 rpm in normal day-to-day driving with the GT+. 2. The recommended octane level for the 1.5 TSI is 95, though it can run on 91 octane as well. If you do go for the 1.5 TSI, I would suggest to feed it 95 octane as the difference in performance/efficiency/behavior is noticeable. Occasional suspect fuel should not be a problem, but you have to keep an eye on the fuel quality of the petrol you are feeding it. The 1.5 TSI is a highly specialized engine with very fancy high pressure fuel injectors. It is not a ""Fill and Forget"" engine. If you have regular highway runs on known roads, I would suggest having established CoCo petrol pumps for your car's fuel stops. 3. In short it has gotten better. I have answered this above in more detail above. Cheers I have had my 2021 polo GT tsi serviced from PPS (both Nagawara and HAL) a couple of times now. While the service experience has been decent, they tend to add some useless services and additional charges if you are not careful enough. While Elite Motors near E-city is kinda close to my place, I have heard a lot of negative reviews about them. I was going to buy Taigun GT Plus as my second car from Elite but, they never arranged test drives even after multiple follow-ups and visits to the showroom. I bought the Kushaq Montecarlo DSG instead from Tafe Access at HSR.", 9th August 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Bengaluru,33,67

I bought the Kushaq Montecarlo DSG instead from Tafe Access at HSR. I have a nice anecdotal story for my Taigun purchase. I had a very good Pre-Sales experience with Elite Motors, at the JP Nagar outlet. I was in touch with a brilliant SA who knew VW cars and could give me the difference in engine characteristics between the 1.2 MPI and the 1.0 MPI in the Polo, which is rare. I had 4 long test drives, where they got the Taigun GT+ DSG to my home in JP Nagar twice and the Topline AT twice. Each test drive lasted near 45 minutes to an hour. So after all that good experience, I went and bought the Taigun GT+ DSG from PPS Motors Nagavara. Elite Motors (JP Nagar) did not get a Taigun GT+ allocation for 5 months straight (Jan-2022 to May 2022). By April 2022, I was frustrated and made multiple bookings at Apple Auto and PPS Motors to broaden my chances to get the car. PPS motors got an allocation and were able to deliver my Cherry red Taigun GT+ in May 2022 itself. I never took a test drive from PPS motors at all Cheers.", 11th August 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,64,127

Hi Daniel, I would suggest you go through one of my earlier posts https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/offic...ml#post5599820 (Volkswagen Taigun Review) I upgraded from a VW Polo to a VW Taigun GT+. I had few of the same observations as you do. And we are very much correct in them. But the primary point is the cars have changed and so has the yardstick. For example, if we take your observation of the cars being lighter. The current crop of VW cars now have to adhere to new norms of pedestrian safety that weren't applicable before. Thus the body panels need to be softer to prevent injuries to pedestrians. Look at the big picture Cheers.", 17th August 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,64,127
1961, tabadhtodh , 16:03 ,Newbie,"Posting a quick message for the benefit of those asking questions about the AC performance in the 1.0. I will follow this up with a fuller review of my experience over the last 9-10 months (6000 Kms with my topline AT). Living in Delhi NCR, I too had my reservations about the AC performance, however, am happy to report after witnessing a full delhi summer + a couple of trips to RJ, that the AC performance is sufficient. Is it the quickest to chill the cabin? No. Is it the most silent? No. But, does it cause any problems? Also, no. The trick is to bear the noisy blower on full speed, lowest temp for the first 5-10 mins and then take it to a silent 19-21 degs + blower on 2-3 (or even Auto mode with 20 deg will do this after 10 mins). This is similar to what one will need to do in most vehicles. I’ve faced no AC cutoffs in traffic jams (barring when engine auto cut off is switched on). I have even had rear passengers occasionally tell me to decrease the blower speed or increase the temperature 20-30 mins into the ride coz of how cool the cabin got.", 17th August 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Delhi,6,17

No range anxiety as well. 3. No DSG worries. 4. Pricing wise it's similar, excite variant is a good option if on a budget. Only reasons to avoid: 1. You do long drives to areas without charging infra. You can check this on plugshare. 2. You don't have a covered car parking.

That being said the Indian suppliers who are contributing to the Taigun (As its highly localized), are not up to the quality levels of the initial PQ25 yet.

Yes it has been a problematic gearbox. Mechatronics failure, multiclutch failure, entire gearbox replacement are the trending terms on TeamBHP. But it does feel like VW has made changes to it over the years to improve its reliability. The 1.5 TSI doesn't launch as briskly as you would expect. Looks like they have done this to reduce stress on the DQ200. The user manual mentions braking at signals instead of shifting to neutral. Looks like the gearbox coding has been changed to disengage the clutch on Braking. The gearbox doesnt keep switching between D1 and D2 in bumper to bumper traffic. Looks like VW prefers slipping the clutch in D2 compared to frying the mechatronics with frequent D1-D2 transitions. Cheers. Congratulations on the new car, i had a similar dilemma when looking to replace my 2014 vento TSI and ended up with a 2017 pre owned Polo GT. Also own a taigun and a virtus in the family. Yes roof liners have been shoddy since the first revision of the Polo/Vento around 2013 I think. Glad they fixed it. Agreed even my polo has the all windows single touch up down function which works with the key also, MQB-IN only has the function on the driver side, key functionality has to be coded in. Did not like the new wheel (subjective), but it's also missing these essential functions that you have mentioned. IMPORTANT FOR YOU -The AC cooling parameters can be coded in to improve it by leaps and bounds. Talk to your local VW tinkerer. I think it was mellowed down by VW to have better FE figures early on. They did upgrade the software but only 1 parameter. Seat bolstering is way superior than polo vento for my body type. Seems way to soft in polo Vento DSG revision 2 is what we have had now since 2017 I believe. My vento had the D1-D2-D1 issue which was meant to be fixed by a software flash by VW. The revision 2 in my polo feels more robust in my experience so far of about 55k kms, the one in my vento conked off at about 90k kms (Dual Clutch at 80k kms, Mechatronic at 90k kms) Try out a car with a DSG remap, it makes a big difference. My polo has both the ECU and the TCU remapped. To trick to maintain warranty is to map the TCU directly by pins instead of the OBD port. In my car doing this did not leave any logs in the event logger. And lastly. Enjoy your VW. Despite being lighter in build than previous VW cars, it's still better than everything else on sale. Also VW cars are like Lego sets, there's a world of improvements you can make using OEM parts.", 18th August 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Delhi/Noida,106,104

The team wrote back saying i could either schedule a new one or drop by when it is convenient for me to visit. Decided to wait until July for the 1 year service to get both these updates and other changes done. 2. 1 Year service appointment: I was surprised to see no booking for me even after intimating the CS executive a month in advance about the date. The CS executive messed up and booked the service at Nagawara centre. After a short exchange of my displeasure, the DGM services ensured that the car was attended to on the same date, and without much delay. The car did not have a lot of issues that needed fixing, the staff committed a 5 hours time for delivery and i decided to wait until it is done. I was out of the centre in about 5.15 hours. I got the usual one year service done with a full engine oil replacement, along with the software updates. i also got the sunroof mechanicals lubed. I had asked previously if the cabin air filter was worth it. Even though it did not fetch any response, i went ahead and made that change at Rs.999. i have not seen a lot of difference after swapping it. The washing leaves a lot to be desired for, but at that point I did not care. the roof liner was soiled a bit as well. No wheel alignment was done as their machine had some issues. I need to get this done. I have been closely following the threads about Madhu's and will make my first visit in some time. 3. Staff behaviours: Very approachable and patient, and i think there is a reason why a lot of folks say that the Old Airport SC is a better one to take your car to. The team is going through an overhaul with some of the old timers leaving as per the service manager, but they are definitely try to make it up. Other Shenanigans with the car 1. Sunfilms from Garware : Detailed post here (https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/modif...ml#post5545987 (Front windscreen sunfilm?)) 2. De-chromed the car as i wanted. i had been using wraps from the first week, but have now got them painted properly. I absolutely love how the no chrome version looks. Costed me 6K to get this done for the front, read, door handles,roof rails and mirror covers. I am now considering the alloys to be dipped or painted to black to complete the cosmetic changes. 3. Helios has picked up a lot of swirl marks in the last one year - i did not opt for PPF or ceramic when i got the car. I am considering a ceramic coating now, but unfortunately left rear door has a dent, thanks to some driver to decided to park too close and bang open their door and leave a huge dent. PPS VW has quoted 11k to fix this and paint. i am still thinking if we should do this or go ahead and do a minor wrapping. 4. Since i cannot get the ceramic coating done immediately, i decided to take the car to the Turtle Wax centre in Sarjapur Road and got a wash and wax done. They claim that the wax will stay on for 3-4 months if i only pressure wash.

I haven't had any punctures (thankfully, touch wood!) in the 15K kms I have driven my Taigun and I have driven on some pretty bad roads. However, the low profile does show in the ride quality a bit. As discussed in the other posts from January, 225/50/R17 is the best size to upgrade to. Incidentally, in February, I got a chance to see it on another Taigun on a road trip while coming back from Coimbatore, in a parking lot at an A2B outlet before Salem. It looked nice and not at all out of place. Of course, I would love to hear from people who have upgraded to that tyre size on their riding experience.

I did mine in Palakkad, Keralam from a known FNG. Before you decide to paint, please find a detailer and get a black / camouflage wrap done and see for yourself. The wraps do stay in place without coming off. Mine got brushed by an auto so I decided to paint over. 3M / detailing mafia / car laundry any of these folks should be able to do it. If you do plan on painting - the service centre does it but charges approx 25-30K. You could check with code6 garage as well. I had also checked for a dipping from Dawn customs, their quote was close to 15-16K As of Sunroof - I hardly use it. I got the lubed during the yearly maintenance service, I checked it now seeing this question, and it's become really noisy. I need to check as well.

2011, theoldcamper , 01:06 ,Newbie,"My first post in the forum. Been reading endlessly, pages after pages on the forum and tons of videos to understand what car I want to buy and what parameters to consider. This has been going on since 6-8 months roughly. Its been just me alone, researching, buying the car for myself. Still, a noob, still dont understand a lot about cars and accept lot of knowledge might be superficial. Ive decided to get the VW Taigun TSI 1.0L AT Topline. I did make a booking at Bangalore Motors but still looking for better offers. Unfortunately, I am not able to find the color I want in the passing by version which has more offers since dealers want to clear stocks, hence choosing the newer expensive (by 30K) and with lesser discounts. Reasons (I like to think) to get a car: 1. Roughly. 50-50 miles on highway city. Looking so much forward to tour and do great trips. 2. Was frustrated with mobility in the city, with ride hailing services expensive and auto being too bad on the back and tiring. Ive done a lot of bus rides as well. Led me really tired and having feeling zero flexibility 3. I come from a mindset groomed by upbringing where spending feels hard. 4. Deciding on a car of this budget (~20L OTR) was very tough, especially making this financial decision alone Needs: 1. Safety was first priority, considering my dreams of doing lot of highway miles 2. Decent bootspace 3. Middle passenger headrest 4. Good seat ergonomics, thigh support 5. Was looking for a big vehicle for my ego satisfaction I think, Harrier, love the design, but just too expensive and no petrol, also with EV coming in, its just too expensive. 6. Good ride and handling 7. Low NVH, learnt this acronym and this really connects to me, as I dont like noisy cabin or noises in general 8. Great design was really important, IMO Taigun is one of really well exterior styled vehicles for the body type and size of the car. I loved Kushaq and loved its front grill and mean face, but it felt like an eyesore which seemed will become unlikeable over time. Taiguns front looked boring to me earlier, probably because of smaller form factor, but it grew on me, and I understood why, The whole body is really well sculpted and has a timeliness design. Anyone looking for a great long term classic this is the one. 9. Small but a sunroof for the airy cabin feeling 10. All sorts of cameras, parking sensors (not getting 360 or lane assist on Taigun) 11. I thought being able to see the bonnet helps in driving, but it didnt make sense in the Elevate, but makes a difference on the scorpio. Questions for everyone: 1. I am having doubts of whether I should opt for 1.5 DSG, I did not take the TD because its expensive and reading the forum about expecting issues on DSG in India. I also didnt consider that I really want that much power, in the TD 1.0 felt alright. I am sure I will like 1.5 DSG more, but price plus the DSG gearbox issues scare me. Any suggestions? 2. Should I go for ceramic coating (not considering PPF) or not? If I follow the sacred instruction of right way of washing the car and doing wax/sealant sprays at home myself, can this help me preserve the newness for long? 3. Also was considering doing a ceramic coating DIY at home 4. What VW accessories are good to get? How are the mats? seat attachments? Car cover? (what I really liked on the website is the Beetle miniature cars) 5. Please recommend a pressure washer please + leaf blower please 6. Seen reviews of dashcams, not able to makeup my mind, I want to cover front, rear, may be even sides, with good quality and features. Please recommend. 7. Should I take SVP and Extended warranty?: I am getting a 4 year car lease, where I get tax exemption monthly for maintenance (consider if things dont work I might leave the org in between as well) 8. Please recommend a set of accessories to get immediately after getting the car, I dont want to over spend but kind of close on most of the things Hoping to keep sharing my journey with my first car on this forum.", 3rd November 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Bengaluru,14,4

Punchs AMT felt too significant during gearshift, felt like it was struggling to change gears. Overall cabin felt nice, loved the while treatment and huge space feeling inside. Since, my impression was made by Fronx driving experience I was not clear whether to go for anything in the hatchbacks or micro SUVs. Mainly due to poor Automatic transmission feedback. AMT was a no no. Didnt even go look for hyundai hatchbacks because of safety reasons. I loved harrier and harrier wasnt in petrol, I dreamt for many months looking for petrol harrier on youtube and google searches. I also loved the design of Jeep compass. Honestly, I was avoiding car purchase or extending it as much as I can. Then many months went by. Then Ive been watching some news of Harrier facelifts that made me go back to searching for cars. As I found no petrol, also came a realisation that Harrier AT is going to be very expensive and what I want is in 32L OTR range. Practicality sinked in, I started looking at all cars in the 15-20L segment since i figured either get a 7-9L OTR car or go all the way to 20L, because being in mid something or the other felt missing. My philosophy being, always ready to pay extra if the extra is worth it even if that means going over budget a little. Seeing the market and the world, everything is going to be expensive going forward as it has been, for cars as well. Hence I didnt want to force the issue of budgeting too hard. So recently within a month, I found Honda elevate as a good contender, once I sat in the vehicle, it doesnt wow, the front exterior is great, side is a bummer and read is alright. The part which made me instantly say no were poorly designed seats, there is poor thigh support on driver and read seats as well. Another dislike was NVH levels and noisy engine. Great suspension though, the model I was looking for came down to 20L otr. And it did not make sense to spent this much for what the issues were. I was avoiding VW/Kushaq because of what I hear from everyone that it is not fuel efficient, expensive maintenance and poor ASS reviews. Also for some reason VW never attracted me in las 8-10 months of search. Kushaq I loved, but avoided going yo showroom because of same reason. But after my high hopes going down the drain for elevate, considering it had great ASS and low maintenance tag, I started looking out. Thats when Grand Vitara,/HYryder, VW and Skoda came into picture. Love the GV exteriors, looks big. Also love how KIA seltos looks. Took TD of GV felt just alright, it didnt wow me, it was the strong hybrid model. Went past a big pothole as SA insisted I go fast over it. The entire car jumped in air it felt. didnt give me good confidence. But generally its nice to drive it. No major feedback, interiors were just alright not a fan. Small boot also was a downer. Next on same day went for walk around of Skoda and VW. Loved the experience of VW showroom and the SA, the guy was very enthusiastic, he eventually made me make my mind by giving me the best TD experience. Both Skoda and Kushaq felt similar except power delivery. My initial love for Kushaqs front mean grill went away as I felt it will be eyesore, as it became already for me. Taiguns clean looks kept growing over me. Taigun did feel stiff but Ill take it over less stable highway ride. Is it necessary to spend 20L OTR. Hard question, safety wise what I am looking to do which is more highways, definitely yes. Considering the entire safety package, paired with the performance. I know I am an enthusiast at heart, just never got my own car for years to do so. Price wise it doesnt bode well to be honest, I am sure I tried to convince my mind, but Its not breaking my bank. I see it as an opportunity to make more money. As any big purchase for salaried person will eat some savings. I am in early 30s.

So you have driven elsewhere, just not in Bangalore. You want a safe car, automatic, reasonably good performance characteristics, good NVH, decent fuel economy and reliable ASS. Sadly you wont get it all Taigun/Kushaq are the only mid size SUVs which have 5 stars in GNCAP. Other cars (Elevate, New Seltos) could be 5 star rated, but we don't know that yet. Performance & fuel economy are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Any performance driven turbo petrol engine (VW/Skoda/Creta/Seltos/Astor) is going to be thirsty, unless you coast all the time. If you want fuel economy, you will have to get the naturally aspirated engines (Creta/Seltos/Astor/Elevate) and drive with a light foot. Or you can go all out and get a mild/strong hybrid (GV/Hyryder). NVH levels across the segment are comparable, but I heard the Koreans/Japanese (Creta/Seltos/Elevate) do a better job of it than the European/Chinese (Taigun/Kushaq/Astor). Reliable ASS: As long as you are staying in a tier 1 city, servicing any of the above brands/cars should not be an issue. If you dont like service at one, you can switch to a different one. Some will be 20% more expensive, some will be 20% cheaper. Some will be far away, some will be close by. Some will try to rip you off, some wont I would suggest not to make this a criteria, if you stick to tier 1 cities. If not, then its a completely different discussion. Let us know, what is really important to you. By your previous post, it looks to be sorted performance/drivability. Are you willing to give up the other aspects for this? or do you want a balance?

Found good mileage as well depending on how one drives. Since, Ill also enjoy time to time, I am okay with low FE time to time. You seem to have your heart set on the Taigun Lets talk Taigun then. I had a previous post comparing the engine/gearbox of the Topline and the GT Plus here (https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/offic...ml#post5251651 (Volkswagen Taigun Review) This was my observation more than a year back, before I took delivery of the GT+. I have now driven it for 12K kms. I believe there must be a 3-4 lakh difference between the OTR prices of the Topline and the GT+ variant. I believe the feature list difference between both of them is much narrower now (With the addition of ventilated seats/electric adjusted seats etc). But this price difference is more than justified. The 1.5TSI/DSG is a brilliant combo and makes the Taigun a very potent vehicle. The 150 HP figure is not that important, as you will never travel at 215 kmph to make use of it. The important bit is the 250 NM that is available between 1700 RPM and 3500 RPM. It makes the car amazingly quick/fun to drive even within city limits. The higher price is well justified for someone who enjoys a spirited drive. If you can afford it, you will never regret buying a more expensive/powerful car. That being said, I did realize that the GT+ seats are more supportive compared to the Topline variant. They have better under thigh support, especially for the driver. Strange but true Let me know if you have any other specific questions. I have been a VW owner since 2014 in Bangalore. I bought my Polo 1.2 MPI in 2014 and sold it in 2022, replacing it with the Taigun GT+. Cheers.", 4th November 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,64,127
2017, theoldcamper , 14:20 ,Newbie,"I think price difference is a lot. It does seem it’s worth the difference. In your opinion, for someone who will cover 40-50,000km in let’s say 2 years time. Would you say the mileage on the 1.5DSG will actually be cheaper than the 1.0AT, considering the price difference? For me it’s tempting to get the DSG but reliability raises concerns, do you think the 7 year warranty shall do the trick? Another point is total cost of ownership. That becomes quite steep, also add the accessories, cleaning, care etc. Honestly it’s confusing, both gearbox failure concern and breaking the budget if I save more money on fuel and some more with 1.0L.

I also spoke to an acquaintance and found that bumper to bumper traffic its rather stressful to DSG.

The DSG gearbox doesnt enjoy traffic, thats true. I mitigate this, by shifting to manual mode whenever I am in bumper to bumper traffic, to relieve the stress on the gearbox. You have your heart set on the Lava Blue topline variant. The dealer SA probably understands that. This is also the latest and greatest color that the Taigun comes in. Nothing that you can do can bring down the price by any significant margin What you can do is make multiple bookings across dealers across the (Do a minimum of 3). No need to visit them, just call them and pay the booking amount to show you are serious. Now you can pitch them against each other. That should give you some sizeable reductions (If at all, as Lava Blue is hot selling right now). Regarding time of purchase, it wouldnt matter in your case, as you want a hot selling item. It may have mattered, if you wanted a white or grey Highline, as dealers have rows and rows of them in their stock yard that they want to liquidate. SVP purchase is up to you. It does save you from service cost inflation as well as random ripping off at the service center. But you have to pay for 4 years upfront. I dint choose it for my purchase, as I rather prefer dealing with the service center (As I have been a long time VW owner). Extended Warranty was a must for me (DSG ). Nothing wrong in getting it, if you can fit it in your budget. Just brings more peace of mind. Cheers.", 5th November 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Bangalore,64,127

Agree, I agree, I also like the looks of Virtus/Slavia a lot, they offer decent ground clearance. Although never drove any sedans, only sat in them, they never pulled my attention. I also like to think I like taller rather big sized vehicles like Land rover, Safari. And I cannot get those both for reasons of price and them being too big for city. Similar is the reason for sedans, they are too lengthy to operate within city, also difficult to park. Also, I like sitting on a higher ground. I absolutely loved the hatchback feeling of Taigun while on the drivers seat.

But think about whether you may regret having foregone additional space for a higher higher cost. Taigun is not exactly sub 4m either.

I drove to my destination, parked, returned in 30 mins, and it started. There however was a weird crackling sound from the left side speakers.

Now the sound quality was ok. They reset the settings in the system, and asked me to keep driving and see. Any idea about what is happening?

2032, omranga98 , 09:25 ,BHPian,"You know the car is good when your daily driven car has lesser kms on the ODO than the weekend car So sometime around May last year, i got an Ignis and a Taigun (15 days apart). Ignis does my daily office/factory duty while Taigun is for the weekend runs. As of today, Ignis stands at 10500 Km and Taigun is at 11000. Which brings me here again after a couple of months to give a 11K Km update. Oh, and you can check out my 7000 kms update/mini review here: https://www.team-bhp.com/news/buying...7000-km-update Will try to keep it simple and touch a few key points along with some interesting findings. Starting with: Hitting 10000 KMS It has been a breeze! The car works like a charm and being the more powerful 1.5 TSI coupled with DSG, you can never get bored of how this car pulls when it needs to or how well this car can behave at higher speeds or at city speeds. I guess i have faced two issues with the car till date: a) The power window for the driver side had an issue and would not work with the auto up/down half of the time but this was later fixed by VW. But in the process of fixing it, they created the second issue: b) The driver side window rattles when it is not completely shut and power window switch housing also creeks when i play a little bass heavy tracks. It almost sounds as if some clip has broken inside the door housing and causing the glass panel to have a little play. I have not gotten the time to visit VW and get this fixed because it has been a very busy year. In fact, i opted for their pickup and drop option for car servicing. I thought it would be convenient but i ended up stalking the car with the VW tracking app to keep the speed and location in check haha. Some interesting discoveries a) I noticed this recently but VW has different suppliers for different glass panels on the car. The windshield, rear glass and the quarter windows is supplied by ASAHI INDIA GLASS LTD. while the windows are supplied by SAINT-GOBAIN SEKURIT. Here is a picture for reference: b) I found an option in the infotainment that said : Reminder message or something along these lines. So i toggled it on. Why not huh? Now this gives me this screen everytime i switch off the car and open the door. Talk about German humour? well, It reminds you to not forget your children in the car (fair because there might have been a situation) but then it reminds you to activate Valet mode before that. Heck even turning off lights is 3 points higher than forgetting your kid in the car. c) ACT or Active Cylinder Technology is underrated: This is for the folks on the sideline of deciding whether to get 1.0 TSI or 1.5 TSI. The bigger engine comes with ACT which basically shuts of ignition in cylinder 3 and 4 when the car is driven at a constant speed on a flat gradient. This makes this car really good for long distance cruising. I have seen upwards of 18 kmpl on one of the days when i felt like driving a bit sedated. I have seen 2 cylinder mode get active at 110 Kmph and as low as 30 kmph. The switch is seemless and it is actually effective! So i feel it should be another point to consider when making the decision between 1.0 & 1.5. This is if the drastic power difference is not enough! d) I feel most do not know this but Taigun does not have a dual barrel setup like it appears to have. ie. both low and high beam is from the projector in the headlamp unit while the reflector looking like setup beside is a dummy. With that said, it is a good setup if not great. I have driven through pitch black highway/hill sections and the throw is good. Way better than what my Polo had! Maybe down the line, i might add one of those light bars in a sneaky manner so it does not look out place. Each projector houses about 12 high powered LEDs which you can notice projecting on my wallet in the picture below. e) I really like how it looks. Be it during the day time: Or as the Sun sets The rear light bar as it gets darker. or a quick view out of the office window To sum it up, it has been a pleasant experience owning Taigun. Although DSG failing nightmares have reduced, they have not gone completely. I had started an SIP when i booked the car called DQ200 contingency fund. It should be adequate by the time it might actually fail haha.", 14th November 2023,volkswagen-taigun,Kolkata,123,"1,376"

Car hasn't been delivered yet. The delivery will happen over the next few days, as the registration process is underway. While making the downpayment we were given a proforma invoice, mentioning the details of the breakup of the price and discounts they are offering. Sharing a screenshot below. Today the sales advisor shared the final invoice copy and the discount amount is different along with the ex-showroom price of the car. When I asked about the difference in the discount amount, the sales advisor said that after applying GST the discount has been offered. Does GST apply on discounts?? A little skeptical here, but I might be completely wrong. The sales advisor has been helpful but I want to be sure that I'm not being taken for a ride.

Did you negotiate on the On-Road price with the dealer or the discount amount only? If the On-Road price is as negotiated, then it shouldn't make a difference to you, under which head the discounts are parked under. Dealers have multiple levels of negotiations with their partners (Manufacturer, Accessories, Service Center, Insurance etc). So they may need to distribute the discount amount under varying heads.

I don't think there is any issue with buying the battery outside though the service centre has been discouraging it. I inquired with the local Exide and Amaron dealers. They have not been able to find a replacement battery for the Taigun in their official listing. They said they can help if I send them a pic of the original battery specs. From my experience the battery in these cars always give up without any prior warning. I had the same issue in my Vento.

2086, Atharva14 , 22:30 ,BHPian,"24.5K Kms update on my Taigun. Update 1 The clutch master cylinder was changed at 23k Kms. The clutch pedal used to sink in at almost very light pressure and get stuck. Parts were ordered in a week and was replaced. Since it is a hydraulic clutch, it uses the same oil from the brake oil reservoir, which requires the bleeding process to be done again. Drove for 1.5K kms after that and the clutch is just fine. Update 2 On my third driver-side window motor now. The first one part no. XY-a changed within 10 days of delivery.( April 2022) The second time, part no. XY-b changed to add the missing autofold orvm in my topline variant. (May 2022) The third time, part no. XY-c changed recently because the window just stopped rolling down out of nowhere. According to the SVC, this motor is the latest one developed and is less prone to failure. Let's see how much time this motor holds up to. Post motor change, the window roll up down has slowed down considerably, compared to the other window. Software updated to the latest version for the auto up/down as well. Update 3 Got the puddle lights (logo projection) installed from the service center as well. A new accessory and costs 3K for a pair. Attached Detailed video of the installation. Got JK Tyre treel tpms installed from a tyre shop. Cost 3k for installation, tyre alignment, and balancing. https://youtu.be/iAY4RJOVJIE?si=q8bxvcNM-F-1hVQ_ https://youtube.com/watch?v=2U9fmTdO...5VxYXZEgBz-ezE Update 4 Got both headlights changed under warranty. The right side DRL was fading out and looked yellow. The left one had no issue but SvC went ahead and claimed both headlights under warranty. Installation requires bumper removal to unscrew the headlights. Got the new ones installed and the beams aligned properly at the svc. Attachment 2557800 Update 5 VCDS Tweaks 1. Digital tachometer 2.

We had purchased SX4 in early 2009 and 2024 being at the corner meant completion of 15 years and the 10-15 year old rule in Delhi-NCR also meant that we have to take a quick decision regarding it and considered the following options: I currently reside in Panchkula and make weekly trips to Gurugram, so thought of considering its registration extended in Panchkula, and keeping it for another 5 years. The reason being, the car was driven only 97k km and was in immaculate condition and we didn't really feel the need to sell it off immediately. Keep driving till the end-of-life and get it scrapped and avail incentives being offered. Sell it off and buy a new car. After many deliberations and discussions, we opted for 3rd option and then began the search for a new car. The budget was approx 25 lakhs, however, we also thought that we should restrict it to 15 and with the remaining budget replace our 7 year old Baleno diesel next year. So the budget remained in the bracket of 15-25 lakhs and hence the following cars were considered: Cars considered: Tata Nexon: Had booked the pre-facelift XZ+S(D) given the massive discounts. was falling well below the budget and was good enough for highway drives. MG Hector: Fell within the budget and was being offered huge discounts on Diesel variant. Toyota Innova Crysta: Trust in the brand made us consider it but dropped due to waiting period. Tata Harrier/ Safari: Pre-facelift models were being offered at huge discount and were falling well within the budget. Honda Elevate: New car but didn't feel good spending 20 lakhs on it. We were not willing to buy Maruti, Kia or Hyundai primarily because we were looking for a strongly built car and hence the case. We didn't even consider VW/ Skoda due to past experiences of near & dear ones who suggested that we shouldn't buy it owing to high maintenance. We went ahead with Nexon and finalised the delivery date etc. on the condition that we will do PDI first and then release the payment. However, on the day of PDI, on reaching the showroom, the sales executive informed that he is on his way and will take an hour to reach, that's when we went to VW since we had to pass that 1 hour and the rest is history. We looked at both Taigun & Virtus and Taigun GT appealed us more. Took test drive of GT DSG and TC and found that DSG is leaps and bound ahead of TC and finalised the same. They gave a huge discount and better resale value of our SX4. However, family members were still apprehensive of the brand and after multiple visits to the showroom, test drives, they were convinced to go for Taigun but said that we should go for 1.0 Tsi TC due to 2 lakh cheap and better reliability. But I wasn't convinced and persuaded them to go for GT+ DSG since we drive mostly on highways and it will be a much better option in comparison to TC. Finalised on the colour, which was pre-decided that we'll be going for Lava Blue, since it was a relatively new addition to the colour palette. The sales executive informed that he has 1 car in stock and when we went to stockyard to check, we got to know that it has been sold and was there till yesterday. We decided that we should wait and look for other options or go ahead with Nexon. However, in the evening we were informed that GT+ DSG LB is in transit and is the updated model with ES+Subwoofer and it fortified our decision to get the car as early as possible. Did the PDI, loan formalities etc. and finalised the date of delivery i.e. 10.11.23 (Dhanteras) and finally got it home. My Perspective after Purchase and 8k km of driving. Engine & Gearbox: Engine is super-smooth, effortless cruiser on the highway, gear shifts are not felt at all except when shifting from 2 to 1. Power on tap given the fact that I haven't driven a car with so much power & torque. Excellent confidence on highways, I consider it as a perfect replacement for our beloved SX4. Ride Quality & Comfort: Superb ride quality, I don't think any suspension noise creeps in as reported by other members or maybe I am liking the car way too much. Seats are good and best for 4 people. I did a 3k trip in December to Kanpur, Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Khajuraho. Drove back non-stop from Lucknow to Chandigarh and I didn't feel tired or exhausted at all, such is the comfort I am experiencing. Fuel Efficiency: On highways I get 20-21 kmpl on cruising speeds of 90-100 which gets reduced to 18-19 kmpl on highway speeds of 110-120. In moderate city traffic, as observed in Panchkula-Chandigarh, I am getting 14-15 kmpl which gets reduced to 12-13 with instant acceleration/ heavy foot. Eco mode works efficiently and the switch from 2 cylinder mode to 4 & vice-versa is smooth and doesn't feel if it is running on 2 cyl. On my UP-MP trip, I got 18 kmpl overall. Niggles & Issues: Squeaking noise from driver side door. On undulating roads, the gearbox shifts to 1st gear and doesn't upshift even on manual input/ paddle shifter. Rest appears fine to me. Sound System: Feels good, sound quality is impressive, expecting improvements after coding. NVH: Smooth & Refined, can't hear the engine but get loud at higher revs. Car came with CEAT tyres, I have found them to be good. Service Experience: Average, I felt that VW Service center personnel are not that agile/ active as compared to MASS where they quickly attend to you and your vehicle, I am expecting a change in my perception. Overall Ownership Experience: Fantastic. Upgrades Planned: Fog Lamps, VCDS Tweaks, Bonnet Insulation (if available) Accessories purchased from VW: Window shades: rear, side window Door visors Car Mats (fabric) Car Cover Trumpet Horn Luggage Net Will keep you posted with new developments, experiences.

2111, asmr , 11:49 ,BHPian,"Hello all! It has been a while since I posted on this thread. I started a new role a few weeks back and have been commuting on all weekdays. It's a 7km one way route that runs through some bad stretches of roads (both quality of road and congestion) but it also features a good amount of extremely bad drivers sharing the road. My Taigun 1.0 AT stays mostly in D2, averaging 15-18kmph speeds, taking 30mins to complete the commute. I noticed that my mileage figures are extremely bad. In the last refill, it came to 7.3kmpl and it is heading towards 6.xx from the current numbers I see. Now, it know that this engine is not one known for decent mileage in city traffic, but some thing feels off for me. Even standing at signals, the mileage on MID drops a full 1kmpl in 2-3mins. The car has run 16,000+ Kms and has gone through the normal service cycles (last one was in November 2023) and no issues were found. I even rechecked tyre pressures and still didn't see any change. Even on highway runs, the numbers seem to have come down, especially when using XP95. It might be an outlier, but I seem to get slightly better mileage when using BPCL's normal petrol! Is my experience typical of this variant? Has anyone recorded this low mileage numbers in their city commutes?", 10th March 2024,volkswagen-taigun,Chennai,324,"1,021"

Has anyone recorded this low mileage numbers in their city commutes? Same team asmr. I have just had this conversation with my significant other this noon. My home to office is 8km one way and most of the days, the mileage figures are between 7-8 and the lowest being 5.8. my 8km drive often takes 40-50 mins thanks to the infamous Bengaluru city traffic. Off late I've noticed that even on my highway runs the mileage has considerably dropped to 13-13.5 kmpl using xp95. I did however for once shift to HP POWER95 and found the mileage to be better, closer to 15kmpl. HP Power95+ additive (STP Octane Booster) did result in 16-16.5 kmpl. This is when I use cruise control mostly. Even otherwise with the premium petrol filled, during weekends where traffic is considerably less the mileage figures have come down to 11-12kmpl. This is all against the previous experiences of average mileage around 13-14 in the city and 15-17 during Highway drives. I'm starting to think if I really need to replace the car with a hybrid car. But the driving dynamics are hard to let go. On top of this, I'm at 20.5K kms in the odo, my brake pads have to be replaced already. I'm staring at a bill of 11K+. None of the cars in my household and friend's circle has such low numbers.", 10th March 2024,volkswagen-taigun,KA01/KL13,90,135

I am relieved that I am not the only one facing this issue but at the same time, I am worried that this won't be sustainable in the long run. Spending a full tank just to move 300-350km seems very uneconomical. While I am a sedate driver, I do love the ergonomics and the confidence this vehicle gives while on the road. However, this reduction in performance, intended or otherwise (I am thinking some software update screwed up some mechanics inside), is going to be the larger factor. I have read elsewhere that quality of XP95 is very inconsistent. I will run 2 more tanks, one with HP's power95 and another with BP's normal petrol. Then it will be time for some decisions to be made.", 11th March 2024,volkswagen-taigun,Chennai,324,"1,021"

Then it will be time for some decisions to be made. I'm going on a long drive tomorrow morning, filling with HP power95 and will plan to use XP95 again on my return journey coming Sunday. I'll keep a track of the mileage and update. Regarding decision making, I happened to take the new Seltos GT of a friend for a short drive yesterday and found the steering wheel to be heavy and stiff compared to VW, and the boot space is abysmal compared to Taigun. I'm confused too. I might keep the car for another 3.5 years and retort to using bike for shorter distance and eventually do a parallel switch. I have not seen any car that I can immediately go and say this is what I want except for the MS Grand Vitara and Toyota Hyryder. The heart says to wait out or consider either MS Invicto or the Innova Hycross but the financials just don't add up for me at this point.", 13th March 2024,volkswagen-taigun,KA01/KL13,90,135

2116, darthvader5000 , 20:57 ,BHPian,"Been a while. My Taigun TSI automatic (non sunroof, ventilated seats)with ac set at 21.5 has done just about 7.8K since March 2022. Couple of long drives Del- Himachal. Avg economy with a sedate foot and cruise mode thrown in, driving at 90 gave 15 per litre. In Delhi city traffic drive hard, its 7.8, drive aaraam se it's 10.8-11.2. But what gets my goat is the one touch window not working on the driver's side. Am an ex Polo TDI owner and can't believe this window issue. Just got 2nd service done and seems ok now. But front left seat doesn't have that feature, is what the SA told me. Is that correct folks? Further, the SA asked for the screenshot of my Iphone, since i had complained about the random non / suddenly stop charging issue for the last 2 years. Appears that Iphone 12 and above are not supported for wireless charging in the Taigun. Anyone else knows this ? Also if someone would advise what more additions can be done which don't void the warranty.", 17th March 2024,volkswagen-taigun,New,85,36

Onward Journey Mileage (All readings from the Cluster) Total Distance Travelled: 412 kms Kodathi/Sarjapur Road to Manipal Hospital Mysore: 17 kmpl (Included a 10 km detour from the expressway due to a faulty air pressure alarm) Moderate use of cruise control Manipal Hospital Mysore to Hotel Coorg Gate (Makkuttam Ghat descent starting point): 15.5 kmpl Makuttam Ghat section to Home: 15 kmpl Home to Ancestral Home and Back: 14.7 kmpl Average kmpl on MID: 14.8 Return Journey Mileage (All readings from the Cluster) Total Distance Travelled: 330 kms Home to Makkuttam Base: 16.5 kmpl ( Moderate use of cruise control) Makkuttam Base to Hotel Coorg Gate (Makkuttam Ghat Descent starting point): 13 kmpl Hotel Coorg Gate to Poojari Fish Land Mysore: 14.2 kmpl Poojari Fish Land to Kodathi/Sarjapur Road: 15.2 kmpl ( covered mys blr express way using cruise control set at 100kmph and occasional bouts of 120s to overtake) Average kmpl on MID: 15.1 This is the only time I have driven conscious of the Mileage or the speed. We normally follow the herd and don't track the details extensively. The drop in mileage seems to be only a ""when driven in city"" experience from the look of it.

This could be true for my daily drives in the city. I drive through no roads but craters and dusty roads, and the notorious Sarjapur/Marathahalli traffic. I had got it cleaned 3 months ago, but my engine bay is already dirty. I think the carters and unscientific speed breakers are also causing the issues with suspension mounts. Few other things came out during the drive and the wheel balancing/alignment that I got done. 1. The driver side window one side up/down has gone kaput again 2. The winding motors for all the windows will need to be checked. They are all noisier than the noisy. 3. The suspension mounts need to be looked into / replaced as per the FNG mechanic. 4. Brakepads are wearing out faster. Likely has life for another 3k kms. (21.5k kms as of today) 5. The LED DRLs seem to be yellowing. Will wait until July to see if it really is the case. Still confused if I should think of an upgrade or lateral shift next year.", 18th March 2024,volkswagen-taigun,KA01/KL13,90,135

That's an excellent suggestion. I will check it, though it has been only a month of commute in that route. And I filled my tank with BPCL standard petrol and guess what happened? The average mileage on the screen shot up by a full 1kmpl. Same route, same traffic, usual driving style. Of course, I will wait to see the tank full to tank full numbers but nothing could be more damning as a proof for the bad quality of XP95/IOCL in general.

Also if someone would advise what more additions can be done which don't void the warranty. I used to have this issue which was resolved sometime back. But the problem has returned. In the past month itself, I had 2 instances where when I pressed the down button, the window didn't move at all. I had to restart my vehicle and drive for a few meters before the one touch worked again. Also, I have noticed that if I stopped the window roll down mid-way, there seems to be a threshold beneath which the one-touch UP function will malfunction. I need to roll the window fully down and manually raise it up fully. Could you please specify the additions you want to do?
