FE will drop drastically when you drive hard The 2022 Kushaq Monte Carlo • Link to Report This review has been jointly compiled with Aditya & GTO. Thanks to them for the expert observations! Introduction Skoda is finally entering the lucrative midsize SUV / crossover market in India with the Kushaq. This car is the first product developed under the ‘India 2.0’ project and is based on the Vision IN concept that was displayed at the 2020 Auto Expo. The Kushaq will compete with formidable opponents such as the Hyundai Creta & Kia Seltos. While Skoda had the Karoq on sale in India earlier, it was imported as a CBU, which made it too expensive. The Karoq was just a stopgap product to keep dealers happy. Skoda's sales in India are very poor, despite the brand being present here for 2 decades! It's now taking a shot at the volume segment with this modern crossover. The Kushaq has the responsibility to bump up the company's numbers and is an incredibly important model for Skoda. Price & positioning will be key; if priced well, the Kushaq can easily exceed the 2,500 units / month target we've been hearing. In fact, after driving it, we can tell you that the Kushaq has the potential to sell well over 5,000 units / month. The two main restrictions will be the lack of a diesel engine (especially important in this 100-bucks-a-litre world) and the dealer network (in terms of quality & quantity). The Kushaq is available in 3 trim levels - Active, Ambition and Style, with 2 turbo-petrol engine options - a 1.0L, 3-cylinder TSI producing 113 BHP and 178 Nm paired with a 6-speed MT and AT (torque-converter), as well as a 1.5L, 4-cylinder TSI producing 148 BHP and 250 Nm paired with a 6-speed MT and 7-speed AT (the dreaded DQ200 dual-clutch AT). The car comes in a front-wheel drive configuration only. Not offering a diesel will be a major handicap as the two best-sellers are available with diesel options, as are all competitors. Hyundai recently announced that 60% of the Creta's sales are from the diesel. It sucks that the VW-Skoda group didn't bother with making their excellent 1.5L diesel BS6 compliant. It already puts the Kushaq on the back foot. Further, the 1.5L TSI engine is available only in the top-end Style trim. The name of the midsize SUV is derived from Sanskrit, where the word ‘kushak’ denotes a king or an emperor. Like Mahindra loves the double-O, Skoda definitely loves the letter K = Kushaq, Kamiq, Karoq & Kodiaq! All names also end with a Q. Skoda Kushaq Price The Kushaq is built in India with 95% localisation, which (we hope) should allow Skoda to price it competitively. That said, after spending a day with the car, we can tell you that the Kushaq is a premium product and we expect its pricing to be premium as well (especially the higher variants & 1.5L motor). Exterior Design & Styling The Kushaq's styling is unmistakably Skoda. It sports the familiar Skoda family face and the rear too has some resemblance to the Kodiaq. It has those classic Skoda lines and a timeless look. When it comes to size though, the Kushaq is on the smaller side and owners should give up any aspirations of an imposing presence (like the Hector or Harrier). Because of this, we will have to wait and see how the market responds, although we do feel there is customer demand for compact + premium cars too. Did it turn heads during our test-drive? Not at all. The Kushaq gets LED daytime running lights, LED projector headlamps, plastic SUV-style cladding on the sides, 17-inch alloy wheels and roof rails. The vehicle is available in 5 single-tone body colours. Build Quality, Fit & Finish The Kushaq has a monocoque construction and is built on the MQB A0 IN platform, which is a variant of the modular MQB platform adapted for the Indian market. The car is solid & well-built. The doors & bonnet have a good deal of weight to them and there’s not much flex in the body panels. The sturdy doors shut with a satisfying thud, typical of European cars. Overall fit & finish are just as you'd expect from a European car. The panel gaps are even and the paint finish is rich (typical Skoda). Wheels & Tyres The Style variant gets funky 17” Atlas two-tone alloy wheels shod with 205/55 Goodyear Assurance Triplemax 2 tyres. These fill up the wheel arches well and look proportionate to the metal on top. They are the same tyres that are available with the recently launched Octavia. However, while the Goodyears were ridiculous on the 187 BHP 35-lakh rupee Octavia, they are more acceptable on the 148 BHP Kushaq. Still, we would definitely recommend an upgrade to a superior tyre model, particularly for those who prefer spirited driving. The Active variant gets 16” alloy wheels with Lhotse wheel covers, while the Ambition variant comes with 16” Grus alloy wheels. These lower variants should offer an even cushier ride than the Style variant which is already very comfortable. Ground Clearance The Kushaq has a laden ground clearance rating of 155 mm. Its unladen ground clearance is rated at 188 mm, which is similar to the Creta / Seltos' 190 mm. Standard & Extended Warranty The Kushaq comes with a 4 year / 100,000 km warranty as standard, with an option to extend it to 6 years / 150,000 km (please be dead sure to take this). Skoda is also providing 3 years paint warranty, 6 years corrosion warranty, 2 years parts warranty and 2 years battery warranty. 3 different service and maintenance plans for up to 4 years / 60,000 km are available. Extended RSA programs up to 9 years are also being offered. Golden rule when buying premium cars and especially Skodas, thanks to the horror after-sales stories we hear = invest in the maximum possible extended warranty available. Safety The Kushaq is loaded with safety features such as 3-point seatbelts for all five occupants, 6 airbags, ESC, ABS, EBD, brake assist, electronic differential lock, hydraulic brake boosting, rollover protection, brake disc wiping, multi-collision brake, hill-hold, TPMS, ISOFIX child seat mounts, auto headlamps, auto wipers & more. We hope that the Kushaq upholds the VW-Skoda Group's usual commitment to safety and there have been no compromises made. Just that, whenever we heard that a platform has been ""modified for India"", it makes us nervous. That being said, we do have faith in this group in the area of safety. Even their old VW Polo got 4 stars in the NCAP! Interior Cabin Design & Quality The dual-tone dashboard is stylish & looks upmarket, with liberal use of piano black at various places. We like the unique carbon-fiber'ish insert on the dash as well as the shiny 'Skoda' badge plate on the passenger side. The 2-spoke steering (divides opinions, GTO hates it), tablet ICE and touch a/c controls do add some spice here. There are no soft-touch plastics anywhere, yet the interiors feel solidly put together without any poorly finished areas. BHPians looking closer will find that the feel of plastics lower down in the cabin isn't as nice as what we've experienced in other Skoda cars. Also, while most touch areas are satisfactory, the plastics on the power window console (doorpads) seem rudimentary. Space & Comfort Being a crossover, ingress & egress are easy. Cabin space is enough for 4 adults. In fact, rear legroom is better than we expected and a 6-footer passenger can sit behind an equally tall driver. Headroom is also satisfactory front & back, although the rear seat is on the narrower side. Two fit adults & a kid or two healthy adults is the max that it will accommodate. The driver’s seat doesn't get lumbar adjustment, yet it is supportive enough. It has healthy side bolstering for support through the corners. The seat can slide back far enough even for tall drivers to feel comfortable. The leather upholstery is of acceptable quality. Driving Position & Ergonomics The ergonomics are spot on with everything exactly where you would expect it to be, and within easy reach of the driver. For a European car, we must say that the cabin is as user-friendly as any Japanese or Korean model (including a wide footwell). There’s actually not a single ergonomic error to be found. The steering is nice to hold, it gets rake + reach adjustment, the instrument cluster has the classic Skoda analogue design and frontal visibility is good. The bonnet will be visible to some drivers, which can be helpful while parking. On the downside, we feel that the high-set dashboard will bother shorter drivers in terms of visibility. While on visibility, we will state that the ORVMs should have been a size wider; their height is fine, but the width should've been more. Cabin Storage The cabin has a total of 26.2 litres of storage space including a 6.1 litre solid-feeling glovebox and a 2.2L deep but narrow storage bin under the driver armrest. Doorpads get accommodating bottle holders and room for other miscellaneous items. Cupholders and cubby holes have been provided in the center console as well. We like the vertical slot on the center console for the passenger's smartphone, while the driver's is being charged on the wireless pad. Additionally, there is a spot on top of the dashboard to place a deity. The front seatbacks have deep pockets as well as smartphone holders for rear passengers to use. Uniquely, there is a ticket / FASTag clip on the windshield, while the non-sunroof Ambition variant gets a storage spot for sunglasses. Air-Conditioning The Ambition and Style variants get a ""Climatronic"" climate control system with an Air Care (purifier) function and a touch control panel. While we usually hate touch-panels for the air-con, we won't complain about this one. The design is such that, even without taking your eyes off the road, you can slide your finger into the perfectly curved slot and move it left / right to decrease / increase the temperature / fan speed. Air vents have been provided at the rear. Features Unique & Noteworthy Features The Kushaq comes with most of the necessary features (including a sunroof and touchscreen head-unit with Wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay). It also gets paddle shifters, ambient lighting (white coloured), connected car technology, wireless phone charging, ventilated seats and a subwoofer for that added punch. However, some goodies such as a panoramic sunroof, electrically adjustable driver's seat and 360-degree camera are missing. The Korean siblings provide these. Audio System & Sound Quality The Active variant comes with a 7” touchscreen head-unit, while the Ambition and Style variants get a 10” touchscreen HU. The HU is snappy to use, has a sharp display and a user-friendly interface. Sound is delivered via a 340-watt system with 6 speakers and a subwoofer. Sound quality is good. Bass lovers will enjoy the thumpy bass from the subwoofer. That said, the MG Hector still offers the best sound system in the 15 - 20 lakh segment. Rear Passengers Rear Seat Comfort & Space Ingress & egress are easy. The rear bench is placed at a decent height as well. Legroom is better than we expected! 5'10"" GTO had legroom to spare when he sat behind the driving position of Aditya (also 5'10""). Two 6-footers will be able to sit one behind the other & headroom is adequate too. However, the seat width is too less for three adults to feel comfortable. It's more suitable for two adults and a kid. If the two adults are on the heavier side, then it's just them, no kid. The cushioning is adequate and the bench offers extremely good under-thigh support. All 3 seats get adjustable headrests. Rear occupants get a/c vents and a couple of Type-C USB ports for their smartphones. Boot Space At 385 litres, boot space is more comparable to sub-4 meter crossovers like the Sonet (392L) & WR-V (363L) rather than the Seltos (433) or Duster (475L). That being said, the boot is well shaped and there is enough depth too. Weekend holiday luggage for your family should fit in. The rear seat splits in a 60:40 ratio for when you need that flexibility. Folding the backrests down gives the Kushaq a cargo capacity of 1,405 litres. The loading lip is high though & you will have to lift your bags to take them out. The boot gets a light, parcel tray and bag hooks.", 26th June 2021,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore,"1,544","17,339",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
1, ChiragM , 09:30 ,Senior - BHPian,"Driving the Skoda Kushaq 1.5L Turbo Petrol MT 1.5L turbo-petrol engine makes 148 BHP @ 5,000 - 6,000 rpm and 250 Nm @ 1,600 - 3,500 rpm: While all variants of the Kushaq come with an improved version of the Rapid's 1.0L, 3-cylinder TSI engine and some have a torque-converter AT too, the top-end Style variant also gets the 1.5L, 4-cylinder TSI engine which was used in the Karoq. It's matched to a 6-speed MT and a 7-speed DSG. The engine produces 148 BHP & 250 Nm. This makes it more powerful than the Korean twins' 1.4L turbo-petrol (138 BHP & 242 Nm), but not the Duster 1.3L's 154 BHP & 254 Nm. There is no diesel engine on offer. It's very sad that VAG has decided not to make its 1.5L TDI BS6 compliant. Those with high usage will be disappointed, especially with petrol now costing over 100-bucks a litre! Throttle response is satisfactory and the Kushaq rolls off without a fuss. Once on the move, the 1.5 TSI provides good driveability. We were happily cruising within Navi Mumbai in the higher gears. The motor can pull from as low as 1,000 rpm, although it's more comfortable above 1,200+ rpm and alive above 1,500. The bottom end is good, because of which we were climbing up a flyover at low rpm in 3rd gear itself. Importantly, this engine pulls much better than the 1.0 TSI from low revs. At the end of the day, you can't argue with displacement and this is 50% bigger in size than its smaller sibling. Downshifts aren't required frequently. The light electric steering, compact size of the car, taller seating, good ergonomics and excellent frontal view make the Kushaq superb to drive in the city. However, an important point to keep in mind is if you let the revs drop too low at crawling speeds or over speed breakers, the engine will just abruptly stall! This stall-happy nature reminded us of how the Skoda Yeti was and take it from us, you will 100% stall the Kushaq 1.5L until you get used to its power delivery characteristics. When it stalls though, all you need to do is press the clutch pedal all the way in and the engine fires back up! We had also seen this feature in the Duster Turbo. Of course, we went on testing this auto-restart feature until the computer gave up and flashed a warning on the MID saying ""please start the engine manually"". Out on the open road, the power on tap makes the 1.5 TSI a fast performer and a whole lot of fun. Skoda says it'll do 0 - 100 in 8.6 seconds on a good day and we totally buy that (1.0 TSI's timing is 10.6 seconds). However, it doesn't have that crazy streak of the 1.0L. While the smaller 1.0 TSI is wild and begs to be driven hard, the 1.5L is more mature with its power delivery. Think of the 1.5L as the grownup bigger brother to the mischievous brat 1.0 TSI. Even torque steer is extremely well-controlled for a 148 BHP FWD car. The 1.5L TSI is very tractable and pulls cleanly. Driving it on the highway is an addictive experience and you will find yourself driving fast, even if you didn't intend to. To overtake, just drop a gear and floor it...the strong mid-range will ensure you fly past the slower vehicle. The engine revs in a linear fashion till ~6,600 rpm. In terms of cruisability, the Kushaq can run at triple-digit speeds all day long without breaking into a sweat. The TSI spins at a relaxed ~2,000 rpm at 100 km/h in 6th gear. Beyond 5,000 rpm, however, the engine starts getting a bit boomy. Summary = this is overall a fast, smooth & lovable engine. Enthusiasts will relish the 6-speed MT. It is slick, with short throws and well-defined gates. The gears are closely stacked together (try shifting from 4th to 5th and you'll see). The clutch, however, is quite springy and you need to carefully modulate it in stop-and-go traffic. Its travel range is longer than we'd like too. This trait of the clutch gets irritating in bumper to bumper traffic. Driving the Kushaq 1.5L DSG Automatic Fast and effortless at any legal speed, this powertrain compliments the ride and handling characteristics of the car beautifully. The combo makes the Kushaq an effortless cross-country mile-muncher, if fuel prices aren’t a concern . Slot into D mode, take your foot off the brake pedal and the Kushaq DSG slowly creeps forward. This will be highly appreciated in heavy traffic conditions where you can drive with just the brake pedal. With a light foot, the gearbox moves up the ratios pretty quickly. Impressively, you won't feel these shifts as the transition is butter smooth. While the automatic transmission makes the Kushaq very easy to drive in the city, when crawling in slow traffic (1st - 3rd gears), you will experience a little jerkiness, which is a typical DSG trait. In the city, the 1.5 motor's healthy bottom end helps you get around effortlessly. Throttle response is good and the Kushaq rolls smoothly. Add to that, the direct-injection and turbocharger ensure that the engine isn't lethargic at any speed. There's always enough power on tap to accelerate or overtake quickly. Out on the highway is when things go from good to great! This is easily among the most fun-to-drive crossovers for 2 million bucks, whether with a DSG or the MT. You'll find yourself addicted to flooring the throttle whenever there's an empty stretch of road. Outright performance is excellent and the strong mid-range takes care of all the overtaking you need to do. Downshifts are quick (not as fast as upshifts though) and the gearbox responds well to throttle inputs. The 7th ratio gives the Kushaq DSG long legs on the highway. And touring you must do - this car is built for long road-trips. In summary, the 1.5 TSI DSG is a jewel of a combination that will keep you happy at low revs & high, and in the city as well as on the highway. Other than its reliability woes, this is one of the best AT gearboxes sold in India. I found the 1.5L TSI to be too boomy at high revs though. If you are continuously driving hard and / or in ‘S” mode, your passengers will complain about the prominent boominess. It is part motor, and part compromised insulation levels. The sound gets very annoying if you are driving aggressively for a longer duration. Tap the left paddle for a downshift and manual mode is engaged. The ECU blips the throttle to match the revs, and holds the gear till near the redline. This gets addictive, especially during overtakes! However, even in manual mode, the DSG will upshift above ~6,000 rpm and also downshift below ~1,000 rpm. We feel this is way too conservative - the MT revs to ~6600 rpm. Manual mode will also ignore wrong gear selections which put the engine out of the above rpm ranges. Long hold the paddles to revert back to auto mode. Cruising around in D mode, one won't even notice the gears being shifted. They are damn smooth. The kickdown response time is quick enough and you will never feel that the gearbox is hunting for gears either. It's in the right ratio almost all the time. When you are in the mood to drive the car aggressively, engage Sport mode. In S, the gearbox downshifts to keep the car in the power band, holds the ratios longer and lets the punchy midrange do all the heavy lifting required. But in ""S"" mode, the boominess is more obvious (due to the higher rpm levels). Out on the open road, you will find it hard to resist the urge to go hard on the throttle. The Kushaq is simply brilliant to drive! On the flip side, we have scarily serious concerns over the DSG's long-term reliability. Just search on Team-BHP and you will see story after story of DQ200 failures & breakdowns. Skoda insists they have fixed the problem, but we aren't convinced at all. This gearbox has inherent design defects IMHO. Some BHPians who can't resist the DSG have mentally relegated themselves to 2 breakdowns over 8 - 10 years of ownership. If reliability is your topmost criteria, you should pick the 1.0 with a torque-converter AT, or consider another car model altogether. Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH) The 1.5L TSI is overall refined. It's a lot smoother than the 1.0 TSI which has some 3-cylinder vibrations, noises, groans & growls. That said, even the 1.5L TSI gets very boomy past 5,000 rpm. We found tyre & road noise at 110 - 120 km/h on concrete expressways / rumble strips to be higher than expected in a car with premium aspirations. On the other hand, wind noise is nicely controlled at expressway speeds. Mileage & Fuel Economy Drive the TSIs with a light foot and they should give you acceptable FE. Turbo-petrols are very sensitive to throttle input though; drive it hard and you'll see the tank needle drop fast. Skoda has given the 1.5L Kushaq Active Cylinder Technology. When cruising calmly on the open road, the ECU shuts off cylinders 2 and 3 to reduce fuel consumption. This 2-cylinder mode will lead to good long distance FE, that is if you drive calmly (which is tough in the TSI). While we never felt the cylinder activation / deactivation happening, we did see an ""ECO"" sign on the MID which might be signalling its action. ARAI numbers: 1.0 TSI MT - 17.88 kmpl 1.0 TSI AT - 15.78 kmpl 1.5 TSI MT - 17.95 kmpl 1.5 TSI AT - 17.71 kmpl Suspension Ride Comfort The Kushaq's ride quality can be termed as mature & compliant. We have to say this is the perfect suspension tune that Skoda has chosen. It is neither too soft (Hector) nor too stiff (Seltos). Owners will find the ride quality to be endearing. It offers good comfort levels in the city & on highways alike. Sharp ruts do find their way into the cabin though - the Kushaq doesn't round off the bigger potholes. This could be due to the 17"" rims & 33 PSI tyre pressures. Ride quality of the lower variants with 16"" rims will be even better. Handling & Dynamics As expected of a Skoda, the Kushaq has sorted road manners. It has excellent straight line stability and composure at high speeds. In fact, 120 km/h feels more like 90 - 100 km/h. You can confidently maintain high speeds on the expressway. Driving the Kushaq on winding roads was fun, with the front end seemingly eager to turn. Sure, there is some body roll, but it's a family crossover at the end of the day. Nothing too alarming, and we actually had a blast coming down the Lonavala ghats. The tyres are the same Goodyears used in the Octavia. While they felt terrible on a 187 BHP car, the Goodyears are more acceptable on a 148 BHP car. Grip levels on the mountain roads was fair. Although, we would still recommend upgrading to better rubber as these tyres were squealing under hard cornering @ 85 km/h! Steering The EPS feels direct & sharp. It is light at parking & city speeds which is now the market's preference. Our complaint is that, at 100 - 110 km/h, it is still a level too light and comfort-oriented for enthusiasts' tastes. We wish Skoda had firmed things up more for highway speeds. Even while cornering hard in the Lonavala ghats, GTO wished that the steering was firmer. A user selectable 'Sport' driving mode that would stiffen things up would be nice, but Skoda has omitted driving modes in the new Octavia as well as the Kushaq. Braking While its main rivals, the Creta and Seltos, get all-wheel disc brakes, the Kushaq makes do with discs at the front and drums at the rear. The brake pedal is well calibrated and feels sharp to use. In fact, we felt that the brakes of the Kushaq were more confidence-inspiring than that of the Korean twins. The braking is powerful and we felt confident with them on our highway run. Niggles & Problems Skoda is the first name that pops to mind when we speak of unreliability and bad after-sales experiences. Truth is, many owners have suffered multiple breakdowns, especially with the DQ200 DSG gearbox. Even apart from the gearbox, don't expect a Toyota or Maruti kind of ownership experience over 5 - 10 years. Take the extended warranty without a second thought, and be sure to get the car serviced on time. For its part, Skoda is trying to improve its brand image with maintenance packages etc., but the dealers are the same, the cars are complicated & parts are expensive. Those buying the 1.5L MT or 1.0L AT (torque converter) / MT might enjoy better long-term reliability than owners of the 1.5L DSG. You'll enjoy this car on the open road: There's no insulation sheet under the bonnet. Both the Korean twins get it: An 'ECO' indicator comes up on the MID when you are cruising at easy revs. The Kushaq 1.5L has Active Cylinder Technology, which shuts down cylinders 2 and 3 in the interest of fuel efficiency: Recommended tyre pressure is 33 PSI all-round: ", 26th June 2021,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore,"1,544","17,339",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
2, ChiragM , 09:30 ,Senior - BHPian,"Skoda Kushaq Exterior Images Front is unmistakably Skoda and very close to the Vision IN concept: The rear too is very ""Skoda"". Compared to the concept car, there are some subtle changes to the tail-lamp cluster, tail-gate and bumper: The Style variant gets chrome window lines & chrome door handles. Our test car was finished in the Carbon Steel shade which seems to be popular with BHPians: The Kushaq measures 4,225 mm in length, 1,760 mm in width and 1,612 mm in height. It has a wheelbase of 2,651 mm. Dimensionally, the Kushaq is smaller than its main rivals, the Creta and the Seltos, but it has a longer wheelbase (the Korean twins have a wheelbase of 2,610 mm). Small size doesn't give it much street presence: The car has the classic VAG lines. Notice the crease that emerges from the front Skoda badging and merges with the tail lamps: Smart headlamp clusters consist of L-shaped LED daytime running lights, LED projectors for the low beam and main beam and halogen turn-indicators. Halogen foglamps sit below the headlights, high on the bumper and come with a cornering function. Headlights have many crystalline touches: A look at the detailing inside: DRLs are bright and prominent, even during the day: The signature butterfly grille looks good & gets chrome lining all around: Front bumper features a wide air dam with a black honeycomb mesh grille and a faux silver skid plate. Skid plate has aggressive detailing: No underbody protection offered. Should have been given considering India's unpredictable road conditions & Skoda's expensive part prices: Bonnet has a prominent Skoda-style hump in the middle. The Skoda logo on the bonnet looks swell: Rain-sensing wipers have their spindles & washers tucked under the bonnet: Fenders house unique piano black panels with chrome ""SKODA"" lettering: ORVMs with integrated blinkers: Chrome inserts on the door handles, with request sensors on both front doors: Roof slopes down towards the rear, while the window line rises. It starts rising sharply just before the C-pillar to form a nice kink: That's not a quarter glass on the C-Pillar. It's merely a piano black filler giving a glass-like effect: Lovely cuts & creases, done in a classy manner accomplished only by the German brands: Subtle crease runs low on the doors. Black plastic cladding for that ""crossover"" stance: All 3 of us loved the design as well as the dual-tone finish of the 17"" Atlas alloy wheels. They are shod with 205/55 section Goodyear Assurance tyres which fill up the wheel wells nicely. Lower variants get 16” rims: Even the top-end Style variant does not get rear disc brakes. Still, braking performance is strong and reassuring: Full plastic cladding in the front wheel well... ...as well as the rear: Silver roof rails (50-kilo load rating) enhance the vehicle's crossover appearance. The Kushaq gets a fair-sized regular sunroof, but not a panoramic unit like the Creta's: Rear spoiler is a two-piece unit with a metal portion on the inside and a plastic portion on the outside. The two portions are separated by a crease. Black sharkfin antenna sits at the end of the roof section: Split tail-lamp clusters feature C-shaped LED pilot and brake lamps, with halogen units for the turn-indicators and reversing lights. No rear foglamps in the Kushaq: A look at the funky crystalline detailing inside: Ugghh! That old frame-type wiper looks so damn ugly. Why didn't Skoda choose a modern frameless type? Tail-gate has cuts and creases just like we have seen on the Kodiaq. Chrome strip runs lower down - a staple fitment for India, and merges with the reflectors. No variant or engine badges have been provided anywhere on the car: Higher variant gets a reversing camera which is placed next to the electromagnetic boot release. The reversing camera does not get adaptive guidelines - unexpected in a premium crossover: We L-O-V-E the font used for this KUSHAQ badge. Whoever picked it has taste: The rear bumper has a fake silver skid plate as well. 3 parking sensors have been provided, while a pair of slim reflectors sits higher on either side: Twin exhaust pipes on the left: 50-litre fuel tank is located just ahead of the rear axle, to the right.

3, ChiragM , 09:30 ,Senior - BHPian,"Skoda Kushaq Interior Images Good-looking dashboard with a large piano black insert and carbon-fiber like detailing running from end to end. There are no soft-touch plastics, but the cabin does feel well built and nicely finished: Windscreen is large and the seating position is a little high up.

When cornering in the ghats, it gives you better visibility of the meters, especially the useful rev-gauge. Ambition and Style variants get a leather-wrapped steering. Nice sounding dual disc horns, but not the classic Skoda wind tone that you have in the Octavia: LHS buttons are for audio & voice commands, while the ones on the RHS are for the MID. Scrollers have a knurled finish: Left light / indicator stalk also houses the cruise control options. Very busy! On the right is the wiper stalk. The Kushaq is equipped with auto wipers which are on by default: Just like all other Skoda cars, the engine start/stop button is placed on the right side of the steering column. Located here so no mischievous kid can access it & cause trouble, whether the car is on the move or even stationary: Sturdy lever for adjusting the steering wheel. It has both tilt and reach adjustment to help the driver find his / her perfect driving position: Old school, classy, conventional Skoda-style dials. Dials and needles are backlit in white. Analogue fuel and temperature gauges have been provided too. We are so glad Skoda has chosen analogue instruments (we're not fans of the all-digital trend). The buttons to check the service interval, set the time and display the trip meter are the same as the ones used in the Rapid: The MID displays the vehicle status, driving data, telephone and audio info, along with the oil temperature: The MID also shows the exact door which is open. It covers the tailgate and bonnet too (great to see as the bonnet is skipped by 99% of cars out there): Big hexagonal a/c vents: Typical European headlamp and foglamp controls. The Kushaq gets automatic headlamps. All-black knob here looks too basic & cheap. We would've liked some silver metal highlights or bordering: Bonnet release is located on the right of the footwell: Doorpads are mostly black with a small grey portion, and a piano black patch around the chrome door handle. This looks very boring & plain Jane to our eyes (check out Kia's more interesting approach here & here). The recessed door handle housing has a diamond pattern finish, while the armrest is wrapped in leather. The door houses a 50W speaker: The usual set of window and mirror controls. Driver's window gets auto up & down with an anti-pinch function. We found this plastic panel to be low rent: Wide door pockets can hold a lot more than just a water bottle: A string has been provided (on both front pockets) to keep standing items in place: A slot to put in longer items, such as an umbrella: Reflectors are placed on all 4 doors to warn traffic when the door is open: Did I tell you that I love the KUSHAQ font? Branded aluminium scuff plates provided: Leather upholstered seats offer satisfactory support. Center armrest is useful + adjustable: A close look at the perforated leather seat upholstery. Perforated material is mandatory for the seat's cooling function. The quality of materials used is good. Don't miss the contrast orange stitching: Even the top variant does not get electrical adjustment. Lumbar adjustment is not provided, but back support is fine. The seat offers a good adjustment range (fore & aft and height) and even a 6-footer will be comfortable: Center armrest has a soft leather cladding with orange stitching. It is adjustable and placed at a comfortable height: Seatbelts aren't adjustable for height. Still, the position is neutral and no one will have an issue: A, B, C pedals are well spaced out. A very useable dead pedal has been provided: 3D-effect mats look cool: Music is played through 6 speakers, including one on each door and 20W tweeters on the A-Pillars: Nifty ticket holder has been provided on the windshield. Skoda used it for the FASTag on our test cars: We feel that Skoda has gone for form over function with the ORVMs. We would have liked them to be a size bigger in terms of width. They should have extended out more and you will find yourself craning your neck when joining the main road. Notice how the driver can see the blinker from the inside (like in many other VAG cars): IRVM gets a slim frame and the auto-dimming function. It is wide enough to cover the rear windshield. Headrests (including one for the 5th occupant) do restrict visibility to some extent: Like most crossovers, rearward view is average at best. Because of the thick C-pillars and protruding headrests, it’s better to rely on the reversing camera and parking sensors: A recessed area on top of the dashboard - could be used to place a small idol of a deity here: Center fascia hosts a 10” floating touchscreen at the top. Piano black has been applied liberally: A look at the home screen of the tablet-like floating touchscreen head-unit. I liked the display and it is smooth to use. Wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay have been provided. The system's sound quality will keep owners happy: The system displays the usual driving data. Vehicle status (including low tyre pressure warnings) are also shown: Four apps come pre-installed: 'Valet Mode' lets you handover the vehicle to a driver with restricted access: The infotainment system can also be connected to your smartphone via the MySkoda Connect app. The app displays real-time speed, driving behaviour, car tracking, SOS, trip insights etc. and service / insurance / PUC due prompts: Ambition and Style variants get a Climatronic climate control system with an ""Air Care"" air purifier function and a touch-and-slide function for adjusting the temperature and fan blower speed. Even on the move, the sliders are easy to operate without taking your eyes off the road as they are placed in a perfectly recessed area. Buttons for the idling start / stop system, central locking, hazard lamps and ventilated seats are located above. Ventilated seats sure are a boon in our hot climatic conditions: The Kushaq is equipped with a wireless charging pad along with Type-C USB ports. I feel that adding Type-C USB ports is not a good idea as most people still use regular USB cables today. At least, one of them should have been a regular USB. Skoda is clearly inspired by Apple! 12V power socket is located just ahead of the gear shifter: 6-speed gear-shifter is absolutely superb with smooth, short throws and well-defined gates: A close look at the carbon fiber-like panel on the dashboard: Bird's eye view of the center console. Cupholders get a rubber base: Ahead of the cupholders is a deep slot to place a smartphone: Beneath the center armrest is a deep, but narrow 2.2 litre storage compartment: The passenger's side of the dashboard gets a shiny panel with embossed 'Skoda' branding. It's very well-executed and premium looking: At 6.1 litres, the glovebox is accommodating. The glovebox's opening & closing actions feel very solid & satisfying. We did it a couple of times just for the fun of it! It gets a cooling function, but no illumination. We feel that it is the latter that'll be more used! Roof bezel holds two individual lights, sunroof controls and the Bluetooth mic: Sunvisors have a basic design, yet they don’t feel flimsy. Driver-side unit merely gets a flap to hold slips (no mirror or illumination), while the passenger-side piece gets a vanity mirror, but there's no cover or light provided: Spring-loaded grab handles have been provided above each door, including the driver's! Why for the driver? Well, some old or overweight people can use it for easier ingress / egress. I like how they are recessed inside the roof moulding: The Kushaq gets 6 airbags in total, including dual front airbags, side airbags (no seat covers please) and curtain airbags: A glance at the roof moulding & sunroof cover. We found the roof liner quality to be budget-grade and more suitable to a B2-segment hatchback, not a crossover that's going to cost much higher: While some of the competition offers a panoramic sunroof, the Kushaq makes do with a regular unit, which is fairly sized for the cabin: ", 26th June 2021,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore,"1,544","17,339",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
4, ChiragM , 09:30 ,Senior - BHPian,"Rear doorpads have an identical theme to the front ones. The 50W rear speakers are housed in them. The front and rear doors, both, open in a triple-stage action: Wide door pockets can hold a water bottle and other knick-knacks with ease: Legroom is healthy and even two 6-footers can sit one behind the other: A glance at the minimum / maximum legroom available: Mod Aditya @ 5'10"" had enough knee space with the front seat adjusted to his seating position. The backrest is set at a comfortable angle and the bench is supportive. Under-thigh support is very good, as evident in this picture. Aditya had ~3 inches of headroom to spare: The center armrest is positioned at a comfortable height. It is wide & soft, and comes with two cupholders: Rear seat has nice contours for support. While three 3-point seatbelts and three adjustable headrests have been provided, the rear seat is better suited for 2 adults and a kid (rather than 3 healthy adults). If it is two overweight adults, even a kid cannot be accommodated. Also, the middle area of the backrest protrudes (due to the armrest) and the seat base is elevated in the center. The headrests have a firm compound: Rear bench gets ISOFIX child seat anchors on both sides: Window line rises toward the rear. Shorter occupants will find this restricting their view outside. The rear glass rolls down all the way. While the bottom half is dark-coloured, a lighter top ensures one doesn't feel stuffy inside: Both front seats have deep seatback pockets and - uniquely - smartphone pockets for rear passengers to use. Very nifty! Hyundai and Kia need to learn from Skoda here. While all three carmakers offer front ventilated seats, Hyundai and Kia cars come with horrible hard plastic surfaces on the seatback, while the Skoda gets soft seatbacks that don't hurt the rear passenger's knees: Two Type-C USB charging ports are provided below the simple rear vents. Wish Skoda had provided at least one Type-A port which is more widely used today. Skoda is clearly taking inspiration from Cupertino here! Spring-loaded grab handles get coat hooks. I like how they are recessed inside the roof moulding: Floor hump is medium-sized, but still, this isn't a car in which a 5th adult will be welcomed: Rear light console is sharp looking! It consists of two individual LED lights: Whitish roof liner dips in where headroom is required: At 385 litres, boot space is more comparable to sub-4 meter crossovers like the Sonet (392L) & WR-V (363L) rather than the Seltos (433) or Duster (475L). That being said, the boot is well shaped and there is enough depth too. Weekend holiday luggage for your family should fit in. A wide tray with a prominent border has been provided: Practical bag hooks on both sides of the boot: The boot light and first-aid kit are on the right: Tools are stored in a good Skoda-branded leather bag. Still, it should've been hidden out of view, instead of being stuck on the boot floor. The boot looks ugly with pouches for the tools, first-aid kit & warning triangle all visible: Rear seats can split in a 60:40 ratio. Folding the seatbacks down gives you 1,405 litres of cargo capacity. Floor is far from flat though: Spare is a 16” rim with a 205/55 section tyre. Subwoofer is located inside it: Tailgate gets partial cladding on the inside: A plastic piece has been provided to pull the tailgate down.

I am super excited for the Kushaq and Skoda’s future, I will be visiting the service centre in a week’s time and then have a close look. Kushaq might as well be the second vehicle in our garage assuming it offers similar driving experience like the Rapid if not better.

Absolutely loved the 1.5L TSI motor, fantastic 6-speed MT (best manual I've shifted in a long time), solid build and perfect suspension tune. You should've seen us flying down the Lonavla ghats. Everyone knows how I love the Seltos and this car also goes straight to the top of my recommendations list. The main downsides are the lack of that terrific 1.5L diesel & other Skoda-related stuff = DQ200's pathetic reliability and the fact that Skoda's long-term ownership is never trouble-free (patchy reliability, bad dealers, expensive spares, electronics, injectors, water pumps...). Are you willing to forego some peace-of-the-mind and endure some nonsense for driving pleasure & European finesse? Are you willing to suffer headaches for a couple of days a year, to enjoy the rest? That's a question you have to answer yourself. Skoda is going to see volumes now that it's never seen before. From a 1500 cars / month company, it's just become a 6000 cars / month organisation. Hope the company & its dealers can handle the sales increase. As they say in the auto industry, there really is no company problem that a good car cannot solve. Make no mistake, this is the most important car for Skoda India since the 1st-gen Octavia marked the company's debut. Sucks that they didn't make their brilliant 1.5L Diesel BS6-compliant when everyone else did. With a Diesel MT & AT, this is easily a 8000 cars / month model (subject to good pricing of course!). Monday is the launch and I am excited as well as worried! In recent times, Skoda has shown an inclination toward profitability above all else (Octavia + Kodiaq were both overpriced by a few lakhs, as was the Karoq & RS245).

Always been a fan of German (ok Czech!) engineering and attention to detail even in invisible areas like wheel wells and under body. Great it all continues in the -IN platform also. I hope the crash test and results are out soon and complete the package statistically as well. I liked the cabin and the exterior looks quite a lot. The only unpleasant items in my opinion - Lack of a diesel. Thats an instant turn off for low rpm diesel-heads like me, who like diesels for the engineering, not for fuel price. Especially disheartening to see these European masters of oil-engineering turning back. The rear section design in side profile appears a bit abrupt. The car appears to end suddenly at the back. Somewhat like the XUV3OO but not as awkward. Slightly disproportionate to the rest of the dimensions imo. Not a big deal though. I'm sure the longer wheelbase also has a part to play in this appearance. The inner plastic door panel trims look a bit too dull for such a stylish car. Others in the segment are a bit more imaginative. Not a deal breaker though, surely the Europeans make up for it in terms of build quality and solid feel when using.

10, Axe77 , 10:08 ,Team-BHP Support,"Great review guys. Suggestion: 1. It would be useful to have some side by side images of the Kushaq against the Creta / Seltos on one hand and Venue / Sonet on the other. This is a top of mind consideration for some. As for the size difference, I’m glad they’ve let the difference in their respective sizes mostly play out in the boot. This is where it would impact people the least. (Apologies if I’ve missed this somewhere in the review. 2. I hope this review will be updated with the drives of both the automatics soon. That’s where a good chunk of buyers would lean. Engine / variant selection I think with both the Creta as well as the Kushaq, one important comparison is the exact driving experience between the DSG / DCT and the TC automatic variants available in the same car. For someone fixed on buying a petrol automatic it would be worth getting specific perspective on the driving experience between the top end turbo petrol DCT / DSG equipped variant vs the top end TC equipped variant. In the Creta’s case I’d say people might make the shift to Alcazar even to get the comfort of the TC automatic with the bigger engine even though the 1.4 DCT is more fun to drive.", 26th June 2021,skoda-kushaq,Mumbai,"6,728","20,121",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

It’s a pity that there is no diesel version since the Koreans have been getting some solid numbers selling them. The famed Skoda reliability will be put to test now and so will the service guys. I hope they are prepared for the volume that this car is going to generate. Skoda has invested heavily in this car to come good and it has somewhat succeeded in generating interest in the same. What remains to be seen is whether they can sustain the interest once the sale starts or not !! Most of the creature comforts have been provided and some nifty touches like putting reflectors on the doors is a smart idea. One thing that rankles, will the absence of a diesel mill come back to haunt Skoda or not, time will tell but then if Maruti Suzuki can make the mistake and rue it enough to come back with it, what were the folks in Skoda thinking ??

This is one of the most promising cars of this year and we enthusiasts were really looking forward to it! Thanks for a great review done by you and Aditya. It does cover most of the essentials - a few questions may still remain unanswered as you did not have access to the different engine and gearbox combos for the review and had only the 1.5 TSI Manual car. I do hope that SKoda is able to give you the other variants too soon for the testing. As I shared on the other thread, I have made a booking for the Kushaq, but now I am confused between the 1.0 Style AT variant or the 1.5 TSI Style DSG! Almost all reviewers in video reviews are praising the 1.5 TSI DSG and dissing the 1.0 TSI AT (whereas they had praised the same gearbox combo in the Rapid). So I am in a dilemma now on whether to go for the 1.0 or the 1.5 AT. On one hand the !.5 TSI DSG is more spirited and also more frugal to run that the 1.0 TSI AT, I am still worried about the DSG Gearbox reliability issues and can't make up my mind. Having owned two Skodas in the past - the Yeti as well as the Laura, I always bought manuals as I knew DSGs were a problem. Now I am faced with this unique problem with the Kushaq! Would request Mods to guide me on this! Budget is not an issue and I would not mid spending the extra 2 lacs for the 1.5 TSI DSG combo, but reliability is a big big question mark! I only wish that they would have also launched the phenomenal 1.5 TDI engine with Auto gearbox and that would have really hit the ball out of the park!

And I believe the timings for both manual 1L and 1.5L TSI 0-100kmph runs claimed by Skoda are a bit conservative (typical VAG trait) which can be easily beaten. I am pretty sure the 1.5L TSI MT can do the run between 8-8.5s and the 1L TSI MT in 10s flat-out. Personally I would buy this just for the 1.5L TSI + MT combination!

20, NevGin , 10:26 ,BHPian,"Thank you for a very comprehensive review. It has just the right equipment and has not gone overboard at the same time. They have tried to balance things out to a large extent. A few things to call out: 1. Underbody protection has been missed. However I recall the same when I bought the 1.2 GT TSI Polo (First batch of cars). On a very initial inspection they had offered it to me for some 3.5K or so and I had it put on. Maybe they can do the same. 2. So much for the discussion on disks and drums. If you guys say the braking is good, then its stamped and sealed. Glad this is the case as this would be important. 3. Some how I like that rolled up took kit. Looks old school and appeals to me 4. Are the map lights LED as well? Not sure if I missed that 5. If one were to look at the rear of the front seat, they are not as well as they could have been. The internal structure can clearly be seen through it and if I was a rear bench passenger, I would keep glaring at it. 6. The recess on the top of the dashboard. Skoda is. ""simply clever"" saying its for Idols of God but they offer this recess in Europe as well on the Kamiq. I guess different uses in different demographics and hence marketing as well. 7. Honestly to me, the package is just adequate but that alone won't be the decision maker. People will be ok to compromise on a few things depending on the moolah. Cant wait for Monday.

22, vishy76 , 10:30 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Thanks for the detailed review! This car marks the dawn of a new era for Skoda in the mass market. They have been dormant for far too long now and this sort of a product was genuinely needed. If priced well enough, the Kushaq could be to Skoda what the Jeep Compass was to FCA. Having said that, I hope the former holds sales over the longer term unlike the latter, and this will purely be down to the pricing only. A few points I have noted: - Variant allocation is simple and straightforward. There's absolutely no ambiguity in deciphering them unlike the Hyundai Creta and Kia Seltos, where you literally need to go over the variants numerous times to understand what has what and which tranny options are available with which variant - Hope VAG has done due diligence and localised the Kushaq well. The 95 percent localisation figure is very good to look at but it's also equally important to ensure quality. The Polo/Rapid/Vento have had issues with the cheap Gabriel dampers leaking and the TVS Apache rotors warping very early on in their lives. Hope the localisation done this time has been done with more stringent QC - The infamous DQ200 has been improved is what Zac Hollis says. Uses a new PCB, better solenoids and a better pressure valve (don't quite understand what a pressure valve here is. I think he means the pressure accumulator). Having said this, I hope the valve body itself has been strengthened. This is also a weak point on the DQ200 mechatronics. Lastly, warranty claims (if any) should be honoured without hiccups. The forum has been flooded with cases where owners were asked to cough up the entire amount for the clutch pack and flywheel replacement and those don't come cheap. Hope VAG shoulders atleast a fraction of the amount and provides relief. - Even if someone is opting for the manuals, I would strongly recommend extended warranty. Skoda and VWs extended warranty cost peanuts in the face of what certain replacement parts cost in these cutting edge turbo petrol engines and even certain electronic components. - I would definitely be keeping a close eye on the long term reliability of both the engines. Direct injection petrols are susceptible to carbon buildup around the intake valves as they age which can be very difficult to get rid of and cause misfires on a cold engine. Will be interesting to see if this issue occurs and when it occurs now that these engines are running on Indian fuel - The lack of a TDI is going to hurt, no two ways about it. Turbo petrols are very sensitive to throttle inputs and driving styles. The 1.5 TDI would have been an excellent engine to have in the Kushaq. Not surprising that they dropped it though, considering its elder sibling (2.0 TDI) itself isn't making a comeback - Skoda is trying to do a Ford with the service and maintenance costs.

Ultimately, it is a compact cross over (like the Seltos and Creta), but seems to tick all boxes - adequate leg room in the rear seat, enough space for 4+1 (even my X3 is actually good for just 2 adults plus someone super slim), half way decent boot space, and great to drive (if GTO says it is much better than the Seltos, it is as good as it gets). Hopefully they have not made it a death trap by taking away safety parts, and service improves a bit - and this will help turn around the VAG businesses in India.

The Octavia does not really have a bang on comparable competitor whereas like you said, for the Creta / Seltos segment, competition is fierce. A large chunk of the 2021 market also perceives Hyundai as being ""premium enough"" - its a very different brand today than in 2011. The cautiously optimistic prices will be cautiously optimistic with perhaps more caution in the lower variants (builds positive price perception too) and on the more optimistic end of the curve at the top end where I expect it to go toe to toe with the Creta DCT top end. For this variant, I expect the Skoda to match it very closely, with not more than a 30 - 45k difference on either side of it.

Sure it looks to be an enthusiast favourite - and that's really evident from the engine and driving dynamics posts. But the interiors doesn't seem the place to be - at least looking at the pictures. And that alone will mean a lot will depend on the pricing now, IMHO. Several plastics and dashboard colours give a budget feel in these pics - especially that grey on the lower portion of the dashboard and on the seats. I see many fit issues on the seats - very evident at the backside of the front seats. Almost like an aftermarket seat cover has been pulled on - not expected of Skoda, not in this price bracket!

Been thinking about this - why is the Kushaq been spoken of as a competitor to Creta/ Seltos even though we don't know about its pricing. It is because the company alluded to it since the beginning. And with the pricing, that's roughly where it will get positioned. But this is a car which is probably in the Venue/ Sonet category, and if positioned as such, it changes the value proposition completely. An analogy is the Magnite which is positioned in such a place that people think it is over-delivering for its segment.

42, DVK , 11:58 ,BHPian,"Brilliant review and a big thank you to the team for all the hard work put into it! About the car itself, I think there are three major cons which would prevent a lot of people for buying it. There will be an initial uptick for sure as is with any of the new launches. The Size! with the way it is positioned, I think it would be a neither here, nor there kind of offering. Someone looking at the Creta/Seltos would not consider this for the smaller boot space and the overall lack of imposing character. While those looking at a Venue/Sonet would not be too enticed about paying more taxes for not a bigger vehicle. The Lack of Diesel! The ever so increasing prices combined with in general higher running of cars compared to other modes of public transport means that the people will feel the pinch when at the petrol bunks. The VAG group has excellent diesel mills and not offering them in India at least, despite their global commitments is akin to digging their own grave. The 1.5 AT! Even after Ignoring all the cons, the concerns over the infamous gearbox on the gem of an engine is the final straw for me to stay away from this offering. With most people preferring Automatics day by day, the 1.0 will be the way to go, but those wanting for more power would have to deal with the added anxiety. Do note, my point of view is from that of a highway cruiser with occasional city usage. But I cannot make sense of it even when it would be the other way around as it would sip more fuel, have just enough/not enough boot space and finally not a lot of people readily giving way or in the worst case, cutting in your lane while driving. I think it is indeed a fresh offering in the mix and adds to the confusion while going car shopping in this segment (in a good way). And there will for sure be takers for this who see a use case in their lives.

43, JithinR , 12:14 ,BHPian,"An amazing review as always. Hope Skoda provides the other drivetrain combinations for review soon. I am interested in the 1.0 TSI AT provided it's priced well. However, the only review I have seen till now on this combo is from Overdrive. For some reason, the host seems unimpressed with it and even goes as far to mention that it's not as good as the Rapid AT. My impressions from the reviews is that it's not as premium as it's competitors and actually misses out on a lot of features. This is not what I am concerned about. What concerns me is that Skoda knew that the Kushaq would be on the backfoot with respect to its competitors in a lot of aspects then why didn't they highlight its advantages. The premium quotient has been highlighted well enough but it's not really that convincing looking at the fit of the seat covers and reported low rent plastics in the cabin. But what about its safety? They have highlighted the features but don't have GNCAP rating to back it up. What I suspect is that Skoda thinks that the Kushaq will get a four star rating. That might sound good compared to the Seltos but when you compare it to the Nexon and XUV300 it will fall short. Forget these compact SUVs, if people start comparing this rating to the decade old Polo then it would cause further embarrassment for Skoda. I really hope (selfishly I admit) that they price this well.

45, sramanat , 12:18 ,BHPian,"Great review, as always and one of the most anticipated reviews in recent times! Parsing the various reviews (different reviewers have put up reviews of different powertrains), 3 takeaways - 1. 1L has come as a pleasant surprise. 1.5L, though better than 1L did not live up to expectations somehow. Add the DSG reliability woes and the expected ""new car issues"", it is better to stick to 1L for early adopters. 2. Car isn't spacious (rear seat width, boot space) compared to Creta/Seltos, but decidedly better to drive/handle. Can the better drive dynamics offset the compromised space? Hard to believe a driving enthusiast opting for an SUV. It is more for the family man/woman who cannot afford two cars... 3. Which brings us to the third variable: price. I believe the 1L powertrain can be compared to Venue/Sonet's 1Ls and should be priced 2L OTR above the corresponding variant for the increased size. The 1.5L can be compared to Creta/Seltos1.4L and should be priced on par with them. This may leave 1-2L gap in the pricing (10-14.5 for the 1L and 15-17 for the 1.5L) where they can slot the new 1.5L variant down the line or revise the 1Ls price upwards.", 26th June 2021,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore,290,674,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

52, arjab , 13:28 ,Senior - BHPian,"Looks to be promising product. Hope good sense prevails over the Skoda management and they price it competitively. They can follow the ""creeping escalation"" strategy. Price it low first to grab market share and revise prices in bits and bobs every 6 months. What Tata did with the Nexon and Renault and Nissan are doing with the Kiger and Magnite respectively. I believe one of the reasons for the good ride and handling, (referring to the suspension pictures), is that the rear suspension seems to be a de-coupled setup. That is the coil spring and the damper have different mounting points, hence different load paths. Tuned in unison this kind of a setup offers a very good balance between bump absorption and body control as the suspension loads are spread out in a better way. Incidentally Tata was the first Indian manufacturer to offer this in the Zest, Bolt and Nexon's. I think they termed it ""dual - path"" or something like that. Crash safety rating should be commendable for the Kushaq. VW usually do not cut corners on safety. Looking at the pictures of the floor reinforcements; for example take a look at the picture of the boot area: you will see a strong cross car reinforcing beam connecting the base of the left and right rear wheel-arches. This area is typically where the rear seat ""kick-up"" area ends and the rear-floor, (that is the boot floor), area starts. This joinery is very critical and having a robust reinforcement in this area is always commendable. For torsional rigidity, bending stiffness and rear crash intrusion. Also in the pictures the front seat mounting areas look very beefy indeed. This should add even more strength to the floor area for controlled load dissipation even in cases of side impacts. On the whole the Kushaq looks to be a genuinely good product. Hope the dealers turn friendly, the DSG doesn't get upset often and Skoda engineers restrain themselves in not biting the ""cost cutting"" bug every six months by deleting stuff Wish the ""Emperor"" all the best !

55, PatienceWins , 14:13 ,Senior - BHPian,"A promising product from Skoda. Happy to see that they have not compromised on the typical Skoda paint quality, build quality, fit/ finish and European driving dynamics. Though I am happy to see the promising product from Skoda, I am sad that it does not meet my requirement of a mid size SUV for a family of tall four people. The width and height of the rear seat, and the boot space do not meet my requirements. I had high hopes from this car as a family car with typical Skoda characteristics and I am disappointed that it does not meet my requirement of a family car for predominantly highway usage. I am going ahead with my Creta 1.5 Diesel Automatic SXO booking. I think Skoda became greedy and made the mistake of straddling across segments with a single product. They may be able to target the compact SUV space if they target the 1.0 TSI engine well, but I think they would lose out to Korean twins in the mid size SUV category. They should have either gone for a compact SUV with TSI taking advantage of the tax advantage or go to a full blown war with Korean twins in mid size category with better space, differentiated features, imposing size and a diesel engine. . Most of the current sales in the segment comes from diesel and Skoda should have used their impressive line up of diesels by making them BS6 compliant. Hyundai dealers have become quite arrogant with Creta success and it seems they will remain so, as Kushaq will cater to the enthusiast segment or people who can afford multiple cars, but not for someone who need a single mid size SUV for highway and city usage. Whatever we enthusiasts say, size and looks matter for the typical users and economy of diesel cannot be ignored for the typical SUV customers. I would have gone for Kushaq eyes closed if it is just me and wife with 2 small kids. Now the boys are 6 feet tall and growing, so space remains the prime criteria. Second row space (height and width) and boot space breaks the deal for me. The cost cutting by Skoda is evident in many areas (seat fit and finish, hard plastics, underbody covering, MID etc). Overall, I am happy to see Skoda bringing a promising product. Hope the customers who do not need the space will see the value and make it a success. The success predominantly depends on how well the price the product, especially the 1.0 TSI.

57, SBM3J , 14:16 ,BHPian,"Went thru the review, as usual excellent review. After reading the review and watching most of the major ones on YouTube, here is what I feel, car is not giving the impression as great as I expected it to be. Great ones: Looks: everyone seems to agree on how great it looks inside and out. Nice set of alloys, nice colors at the interior etc. Infotainment unit: looks great for the segment and covers all the functions we come to expect in this segment. Seats: everyone liked the seats and the ergonomics. Not go great: Sunroof: though I don’t mind it, but we come to expect the segment to have panoramic glass roof. Skoda is clearly holding this back for the facelift. Instrument cluster: no 2 ways about it, it looks ancient, it’s clearly done for cost cutting. 1.5L driving feel: autocar didn’t like the way 1.5L car drove in terms of dynamics compared to 1L. Not sure if they changed it up with India focused suspension tune. Steering: feels so soft based on reviews, enthusiasts might not like it. Body roll: seems to be there enough to feel it. Will have to wait for our own test drive to see if it’s acceptable for the individual who is looking for that cornering performance we come to expect from a European cross over. Rear seats: clearly a 2 seater at the back. Not a dealbreaker for me personally, but I think it would be for most people. Size: again I think the size is just right, but most of us disagree. Boot: big loading lip. Clutch pedal seems to be hard for most reviewers liking. Bad: Roof liner and fitting: obvious cost cutting measure, it looks so bad and it moves around like an aftermarket accessory at the front. Reversing camera: unacceptable quality for the segment and no moving guide lines. Plastic: cheap ones everywhere and cheaper ones lower in the cabin. Obvious cost cutting visible in places like the visible mechanical parts on the sunroof, no lights and mirror for driver side sun visor, no light inside the glove box, cheap ac vents, noisy electric window operations, no underbody protection, cheap wipers etc etc. Misses: Digital instrument cluster Panoramic glass roof Electric parking breaks Rear window blinds All window one touch up down(again cost cutting) Sunglasses holder in variants with sunroof(they couldn’t engineer it? Not so cleaver here) Headrest cushion(not really a miss, but creta offers it.) Remote start using key fob( again some competition offers it) Air purifier(Kushaq has air care, but Creta has a dedicated unit with air freshener dispenser) No driving mode selection or traction modes. No 360 degree camera. Additional features compared to creta/seltos: Wireless CarPlay and android auto in higher trims. Wireless charger makes more sense in Kushaq compared to creta. Full LED projector headlights( I could be wrong here, but I think Creta has it as the reflector type) Front seat back pockets, much better in Kushaq. Much better pedigree with the TSI engine compared to the gdi engine. It all depends on the pricing now. Skoda will have to undercut the competition, I don’t see anything which is standing out which can justify premium pricing.", 26th June 2021,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore,100,161,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

I get the need to avoid sticker shock at launch, but Skoda should launch the oynx and Monte Carlo variant within the next 6-9 months with more premium interiors. Also, it would be great if we could get some more clarity on how the car is from an enthusiasts perspective. For instance: 1) does the 1.5 kushaq make it to the Team-Bhp fun to drive car list. 2) how is the 1.5 tsi engine compared to the outgoing 1.8 tsi. Is it an enthusiasts engine or just a more powerful engine?

The Creta boot space itself won't be enough for us in long drives as we come back from our native, Kerala, with extra luggage. But advantage I see in Creta is that I can store small items around the spare tire. Removing the parcel tray will give more space at the top (will not fill more to impact rear visibility) as the length is more, compared to the deeper space in Kushaq. Every inch matters when we travel back to Bangalore from Kerala with our 6 months quota of banana chips, tapioca, jackfruit etc. The rear passenger space is the main issue for me (width and height) with my teenage sons, already 6 feet and growing. The youtube reviews do not seem promising here. I still plan to check it out with my boys in the showroom, but my younger son is not eager at all to come.He is not giving me a reason, but I suspect it is the panoramic sunroof.

Another point to be noted is the difference in fuel efficiency between the 1.5 and 1.0 engines. All the reviews suggest that the 1.5 is much more effortless to drive because of abundant torque.

Even the Skoda Rapid has it for all windows since inception. Hopefully Taigun might not make this mistake. 3) Poor quality Reverse camera without Adaptive guidelines without 360 degree view.

After spending almost 6 months going through Kushaq thread on Team Bhp religiously on daily basis, today finally I can share my views. Thanks for the detailed review and close up pictures. I have been waiting for this car patiently. Over past few months watched many videos on Kamiq Monte Carlo and Karoq Sportline, to get a feel of what I can expect in a 1.5 TSi sporty European car. But to be honest, after spending half a day today watching and reading all reviews possible, I have a bittersweet feeling. Kushaq in its current form seems incomplete. Maybe Kamiq and Karoq videos spoilt me. In addition Korean siblings, which I am dead against due to build quality issues, have introduced so many features in this segment, that we are spoilt for it and feel short-changed if not offered in the car we actually want to buy. I feel Skoda is playing safe by introducing a new segment between 4m and >4m. Given the kind of funds they can invest, the production capacity they have, I can completely understand why they focused on only 1 product. I hope they succeed so that they bring in more cars more confidently and with economies of scale that Koreans enjoy, Skoda will be better positioned to offer more at competitive price. On missing features like Digital cockpit, Pano glass roof, better reverse camera, optional black interiors and sporty seats, etc. will be added to Monte Carlo variant. Maybe Skoda will launch it once Taigun and MG Astor will hit market by November this year. Hence, after 4-6 months they will use it as an opportunity to take price increase and introduce a better variant, to stay relevant against new competition.

The Kushak looks premium and the initial impressions suggest that it should be a success story. Having said that, here are 2 questions that I am asking myself: 1. Since it is placed in mid sized SUV segment, will I buy it as opposed to buying Creta/Seltos? 2. The cabin and boot space is more like the sub 4m segment, will I buy it against the likes of Sonet/Venue etc? The answer I guess lies in the pricing that Skoda comes up with. If they can undercut the prices of Creta/Seltos for the 1.5 TSI engine, it will be a great value proposition and will attract people who are looking for alternatives against Creta/Seltos. For the 1.0 TSI engine an overlap with higher spec Venue/Sonet prices will surely make it a success.

77, ron178 , 16:34 ,Senior - BHPian,"I'm really glad the localised VW-koda SUV we've been waiting for is finally here. It is definitely an interesting proposition with seemingly the right level of localisation. For a VW-koda product in India, it seems pretty well-appointed. I believe some of the misses aren't as important as they are made out to be (the panoramic sunroof, marginally smaller dimensions than rivals, etc.). In terms of cost-cutting, the roofliner doesn't look too bad, however I noticed some inconsistencies in the fitting of the seat covers that make it seem like the seat covers are an afterthought and that they aren't what the car should have come with from the factory. For example the rear outboard right-side ISOFIX anchors are exposed and have prominent contrasting plastic bits - which wouldn't be too bad if they were fitted correctly, but it looks like the holes for them have been cut into the seat cover asymmetrically. Quote: Originally Posted by ChiragM Rear bench gets ISOFIX child seat anchors on both sides: But I'm just nitpicking here. There are some critical features I'm glad koda is offering as standard - ESC and three-point seatbelts and neck restraints in all seating positions. I believe no modern car, especially in this segment, should miss these in any variant. Multi-collision braking and 6 airbags (finally - they refused to provide them on all Polo-based cars) are great too. However, I hope the rumours about 6 airbags being limited to the highest trims with the manual gearbox aren't true. I believe 2 airbags are too few for a modern VW group car. I would've expected 4 as standard in line with other markets. If Honda can do it with the City, koda can too. Also, while a general sense of trust in koda prevails, I sincerely want the Kushaq (or Taigun) to be crash-tested by the Global NCAP. Since this is a localised product, it is very worrying and remains a big question mark. Volkswagen happily sponsored the Polo's crash test because they were confident of it, but Zac Hollis says that they'll wait for the NCAP to test the Kushaq (EuroNCAP loves testing VW group cars frequently - I hope Global NCAP does the same). Safety has been a strong selling point for koda in the past but I hope the localisation stops at size and cost-cutting in less important areas. I think it's okay for koda to charge a premium over competitors if it scores better on safety, however its competitors have not set the bar very high.

In recent times, Skoda has shown an inclination toward profitability above all else (Octavia + Kodiaq were both overpriced by a few lakhs, as was the Karoq & RS245). I expect Skoda to charge a premium for what is truly a great package, but they shouldn't go overboard and make it overpriced. Competition is fierce in the segment. Truly hope they take the pressure off Hyundai dealers and salespersons! Very important that the Indian consumers have a good alternative to the Korean twins.

85, dh.harshal , 18:18 ,BHPian,"Finally onboard the Team-BHP community and what better thread to begin the journey with; than the hottest Kushaq thread. Thank you Chirag, Aditya & GTO. I've been waiting for eternity on Kushaq, Taigun and XUV700 to replace my Vento 1.2 TSI DSG, so that I could make an informed choice in the mid size SUV segment (15-25 Lakh range). Reading the most awaited review on Team-BHP and going through the Youtube usual suspects of Autocar, Evo, OD, etc. I must say it's a mixed bag for me and I'm more confused than ever. Positives - clean, subtle exterior styling - eternal. Brilliant paint job, consistent panel fittings as you'd expect from VAG cars. - Splendid Carbon Steel color. The more pictures I see, the more I fall in love with this beauty in grey. - No nonsense interiors. Again very subtle, nothing over the top (read Creta). - Driving dynamics - Safety features Negatives - Limited rear seat space and boot capacity. Boot may not be adequate for family tours. - Missing premium features - power adjusted seat, 360 degree camera, front parking sensor, panoramic sunroof, one touch window controls (even my Vento has). - Inconsistent results of DSG. Fortunately my Vento DSG DQ200 never gave me a scare, I've driven 50000Km. I'd choose DSG any day, however many TeamBHPians seem skeptical about this gearbox. - No Six airbags in the top of line 1L AT. Now seriously Skoda? As everyone is saying, Pricing is the key. I'd expect below e-showroom prices - 1L Manual Active - starting 10L 1L AT Style - 14L (closer to top end DCT of Sonet) 1.5L DSG - 17L (Closer to top end DCT of Creata) Anything above this, and Skoda' India 2.0 ship might start sinking, before sailing. Honestly, If Kushaq had little more space in the rear seat, little more boot and 360 degree camera, I would not mind giving 1-1.5L premium. But it has left me wanting for more. May be I'd still wait for XUV700, settle for Harrier or go all broke for Compass.", 26th June 2021,skoda-kushaq,Mumbai,87,696,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

90, AKSarkar1 , 19:30 ,BHPian,"For me this was the most awaited review of the month! An amazing job done by our BHPians who are giving us quality content despite restrictions, risks, and whatnot! Highly refreshing to see a VAG car that is fit for the generation we are in and not based on platforms that are more than a decade old. While I feel the overall package gives a bang for the buck, there are certainly some places that Skoda could have done a bit more, namely those aspects are: 1) Speedometer: While all cars are moving towards digital speedometers (more so in the compact SUV segment) Skoda seems to have ignored this completely. The speedometer looks dated and the MID is similar to what I have on my 6-year-old Vento. A design like the Seltos which a more 'upscale' (digital + analog) would have been a treat! 2) The rear wash wipe: The rear wiper is an absolute eyesore in an otherwise fabulous-looking rear design. Looks like some sort of cost-cutting has been done as generally aero-style wipers have been used over the decades. 3) DSG reliability is yet questionable. This coupled with very little underbody protection might make the other components ever more vulnerable on our Indian roads. 4) Lights: Looking at the amazing lighting fixtures on other models I hoped that Skoda would have gone for an all-LED option. Halogens seem to be out of place these days. 5) Interior: The VAG group follows the same interior styling which is great but I feel small things like the hard plastic could have been done away with e.g. the start/stop button already has scratches around it. No specific USP to the cabin per se, could have used a couple of features like an e-parking brake. In no way is this a critique of the car, just points where they could have given a bit more attention IMHO. I feel this car is the much-needed push that the VAG group requires in the Indian market.

With the 95% localisation, they should be able to price it competitively. In fact they should undercut the Hyundai/Kia twins to start with and see how it fares and increase the prices in phases.

Compared to the 1.5 L NA engine offered in the Korean twins, the 1.0 L seems to be in trouble in city conditions.

Having read this review closely it is evident that Skoda has a great product on hand, but I really think that they have taken cost cutting a little too seriously. Hard plastics, shabby roof liner , seats backs that aren’t finished well, dated instrument cluster, reverse camera display with static guidelines and missing equipment. The ride,handling, performance and build is a given with the Europeans, if they do not get the pricing right they are going to struggle. I am expecting Skoda to throw the kitchen sink at it. Fingers crossed for Monday. Just look around at the competition in this engine spec/ price point. The Koreans with Venue/ Sonet , Seltos/ Creta and even the Harrier on pricing. The Kushaq is perfectly sized for the city and the wheelbase and the legroom they have achieved with this length is Simply Clever. The 1 ltr Torque converter AT will be my pick for the city.

At this price point cost cutting is required in some area or other to place it competitively and depends on what each company prioritises. I believe they will price the base model lesser than Korean twins and top end 1.5 manual and DSG slightly at a premium than Creta / Seltos.

There are lot of missing equipments and cost cuttings but I'm expecting such a VFM launch pricing with all these missings. Expecting at least one set of Rapid rider kind of MT and AT variants at the launch. Very few design elements looks weird for me from start, thought it was something with the SAIC-VW designs, later found it was the front bumper which has an uncanny resemblance with the ugly duckling Maruti SCross ! Apart from the non-flat folding rear seats, front bumper and rear hatch door chrome insert, I like the package a lot especially in dark shades. Skoda can easily pull a dual line up strategy with the two powertrains 1.0 Turbo variants with Scross, Duster, Kicks kind of pricing overlapping sub 4m CSUVs and 1.5 Turbo against the equivalent Creta and Seltos variants. All the very best wishes to Zac Hollis and team, every manufacturer in India needs atleast a single high selling product to survive, it's clear 'KUSHAQ' will do it for Skoda this time.

While the product looks promising, few misses from Skoda; interior fit & finish & the tight back seating capacity. I hope, Skoda prices Kushaq reasonably. Yesterday did a bit of thinking on the pricing and my instincts tell me that Skoda may do some omissions in the Rapid lineup and may offer Kushaq's 1.0 Litre variant at a similar price. For example, the Rapid 1.0 Litre Ambition AT is available for around 13.80 Lacs (OTR) here in Pune, so is it possible for them to remove this variant and offer Kushaq Ambition 1.0 Litre AT at around 14 Lacs? Similarly for higher variants like Style.

Obviously a concern that stands out is the use of the DQ200 DSG running at its peak supported torque of 250nM. Hope Skoda is prepped to handle the volumes that would come with it. Only hope that Skoda does not prioritise margins on this one too. My hope and assumption is that they pushed up the margins on the Octavia and Kodiaq in order to give some cushion for a more aggressive pricing for the Kushaq. As it is the Creta and Seltos are overpriced, a premium over that also may be a deal breaker. Seeing several posts on the boot space. Although it may be smaller from a listed volume in litres from others, pretty sure the usable space will be as good as the others.

My 2018 Ecosport S has much better fit of the sunroof panel and the roof liner. It doesn't have the features (many of them). It doesn't get some of the active/passive safety aids in the segment. It doesn't get the diesel engine. It has one of the most notoriously unreliable gearboxes. It's dealers are most notorious for their ASS horror stories. It's neither got the road presence of the Creta/Seltos (or even larger Hector/Harrier), nor the interior space for 5 adults (even creta/seltos have much better space for 5 people). It's neither got the segment thrashing performance (Korean twins/Duster comes close). Neither has it got the fit/finish and build quality of the traditional European cars. Why are we hyping up the Kushaq again? From my perspective, I own a Ecosport S TDCI, and by next year will be on the lookout for a (second) car in the 10-20L rupee segment. Skoda has no answer, for why I should even be considering the Kushaq? Ecosport already has the similar level of equipment (bar the ventilated seats), has a punchy diesel manual GB, a very reliable reputation, one of the best ASS (very happy for past 2 years), an exciting driving feel, and great road presence. I can't think of a single reason Kushaq will significantly triumph the Ecosport. Infact Ecosport has its own aces in form of the build quality, fit and finish, some unique equipment (color configurable Ambient lights, puddle lamps, etc.) If they manage to price it at some shockingly low prices, it might have a chance, other than that, a fat NO from my end!

Looking at the sales of Seltos, even after reveal of crash test ratings, shows that the former point is more important to buyers and will decide the fate of Kushaq in India. So, if Skoda sensibly prices, at least, the 1.0L manual and automatic variants, it could sell in decent numbers. Also, considering size and price point of the car, Kushaq has to pull customers from <4m cars, koreans >4m psuedo suvs, and even all new honda city because of their extreme value for money V-CVT.

I am inclined to think it's a purely psychological thing, and if this very same car came with an MG or Ssangyong badge, the reviewers would use terms like ""solid"" and ""well built"" with less abandon. *Long Post Alert* In my opinion, build quality can be literally categorised into 3 departments. 1. Powertrain and auxiliary systems. 2. Outer shell and Chasis. 3. Interior/Exterior plastic quality, fit and finish like panel gaps etc. Now each manufacturers have their strength and weakness. I guess the general perception of brands are like this: 1. TATA/MAHINDRA : Category 1. : Usually good but for some niggles here and there, especially Tata, and they have also improved over the years. Mahindra have generally been a reliable brand in terms of powertrain. Category 2 : Structural build quality is their strength IMHO. Recent NCAP ratings validates this. Category 3 : Not the best usually, but has improved leaps and bounds over the years. Altroz and xuv300 are good examples of this improvement but even then competition are setting bars high. 2. Maruti/Hyundai Category 1. : This is their strength. Reliability is the middle name of Maruti and Hyundai has been equally good. Category 2 : Not the best. One can argue that, it's not that they're incapable of being good here but are just catering to market sentiments by keeping price in check by cutting cost here. Still the market priorities are slowly changing and I really hope they notice this. Category 3 : Again, usually they are best in interior build but for some obvious cost cutting in plastic quality. But Sonet, Seltos, Verna, new i20 have set some very high standards here. 3. VAG/Ford/Honda Category 1. : Honda/Ford are usually good here but atleast in case of VAG there were products that had issues (like the DSG) and usually are more expensive to maintain. Ford has made an effort to control their service cost, VAG has tried to come up with more reliable products. Category 2 : Here, however, they do really well. The ""classic door thuds"" that journalist rate is roughly related to this category- structural integrity. Category 3 : In terms of interior build and finish they usually have a simplistic approach unlike the Korean twins. But never the less, the quality is usually on par if not better. The build quality usually refers to the last two categories, and also I feel that the VAGs are slowly closing the gap in first category. Now , Kushaq : Category 1. : 1.0 powertrain is tried and tested. In 1.5 L Dq200 makes a daring comeback. But Skoda swear on their life that they have improved it for the Indian conditions. We might have to wait and see. That said, even Hyundai/Kia DCTs have reported issues. Category 2 : Unless NCAP does the test, we can all have our own theories about the modified MQB-AO IN platform. But going by Skoda's modus operandi in the past it will really be a heart break if Kushaq scores anything less than 4 stars. Category 3 : Yes, in the EVO India review he spots a few places where the quality could have been better. But if we nitpick, I think, we can surely find some places in Venue/Seltos. But final verdict on this will be when Kushaq reaches a bigger audience.", 27th June 2021,skoda-kushaq,Kochi,11,24,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

So I have shortlisted the Skoda/VW twins, the Citroen C21, next gen Brezza and the MG Astor. In the background of the impending launch of Skoda Kushaq, I started evaluating the product with respect to my requirements and budget and looks like it would be out of my shortlist due to the following reasons: a)Skoda Rapid 1.0 TSI Ambition MT which is the comparable variant with the basic variant of Kushaq is priced at 9.99 lacs ex-showroom. Skoda Kushaq being a Crossover/""SUV"" with many additional features like ESC, could command atleast a premium of atleast 50k. So, my logic says that basic variant of Skoda Kushaq will be priced close to 11 Lacs Ex-showroom and will be a stretch on my budget. b) The mileage figures of 1.0 TSI is very dismal (based on overdrive reports) and add to it the anticipated heavy maintenance cost as it is a Direct Injection with Turbo engine.

148, motorworks , 23:02 ,Senior - BHPian,"Great detailed review! I keep saying this, no one and absolutely no one can come close to covering the smaller details as our very own reviewers in Team Bhp! Thank you! Secondly, I sense a bit of a negative tone here from many members. Some feel that the Kushaq should be priced 2-3 lakhs cheaper than the Creta and the Seltos. Some seem to call out the missing smaller features etc. And some one even went on to state that the Kushaq’s doors don’t close as well as the Polo, from the reviews! I find these comments a bit needlessly negative, especially when most of us haven’t seen or felt the car as yet! Here is a car that is supposedly as good as competition, has decent equipment, two good engines and on top of everything seems to be quite good on all fundamentals like build quality and driving dynamics. Sure the car looks visually smaller, and it is actually a tad smaller than the competition on all dimensions, but it also has the longest wheel base. So there are good bits and some bad bits as well, like any other car. I had stated earlier that Skoda must price this car a bit more competitively to grab some eyeballs, and also because the car is a bit smaller and our market reacts to size and stance. I would think it would be great pricing by Skoda if they can find a sweet spot between the likes of the Sonet, Ecosport and the Creta, Seltos twins. Also, the 1.0 turbo petrol can be priced extremely competitively too. So while most of us agree that Skoda cannot and should not charge a premium over the Creta and the Seltos, a slightly lower starting price will go a long way in attracting new customers. And I’m not a Skoda fan or anything like that, in fact I have 2 Hyundais at home, a 1st Gen Creta and an Elite i20. But I did own a Skoda Rapid earlier and I had my fair share of issues too, but nevertheless absolutely enjoyed the car. All I want is good, credible competition to the Creta and the Seltos. Both the Korean cars are so identical in their attributes that there isn’t much difference between them, so there is a need for some alternative. I see the Kushaq and the Taigun to be more like the how the Polo has always been different from the typical Japanese and Korean hatchbacks, timeless in design, fun to drive, and fundamentally sorted in most aspects. Skoda and VW are not going to take big time market share from the Koreans, but if they were to get to a 7000-8000 number combined, then it’s not bad at all.

For those who came in late to the party: How has VW effected a compromise with the 1.5 TSI ? The 1.5 TSI (EA 211 EVO) uses the same block as the 1.4 TSI. Coming up with a new block for the 1.5 TSI would have meant higher development costs, larger inventory and longer time to market. So VW took the easy way out and lengthened the stroke of the 1.4 to get the larger displacement. The advantage of a longer stroke is that you get more torque at lower rpms. However whenever you use the block of a smaller engine to develop a larger engine there will be compromises. In this case, it shows up in the higher NVH levels (block is thinner so doesn’t absorb the vibrations). The top end will be rough and the engine will not be rev happy because the strain exerted on the smaller block shows up at higher revs. This is why some reviews have indicated that the 1.5 TAI isn’t a firecracker of an engine like the other TSI’s and it isn’t as responsive as the other TSI’s. If the 1.5 TSI was built GROUNDS UP with a completely new block using the same tolerances as the 1.4 TSI, this wouldn’t have been the case, the VW engine would have been a fantastic engine and the Korean lower displacement engine wouldn’t have even been close. VW’s EVO series (of engines, chassis and shortly gearboxes) indicate short cuts, compromises and cost cutting.

153, RaghuVis , 06:33 ,BHPian,"Excellent review as always. This time the review has come up really faster than the usual pace so that is even better! Coming to the car, let me add my two cents as potential buyer though not immediate. 1. I will be upgrading from Polo and would not want a car with lesser safety rating. Some people argue that GNCAP is not the holy grail. I agree. But that would not make me buy a car that has already proved to have an unstable structure or chasis. So out goes the Korean siblings. 2. With ever increasing traffic, I would definitely prefer a compact SUV which is not too big on road but also not sub4m contraptions created just for saving people money on tax. So out goes all Sub 4m and bigger cars like Harrier and Hector. 3. Again coming from Polo, I appreciate clean lines over quirky in your face designs. So out goes S-Cross (And that Pathetic Auto box). 4. Need a car that is not so old in design no matter how good it drives. So out goes Duster. I am sure there are many who are like me who does not have an alternative in the current market and have to make one compromise or the other.

213, GTO , 11:51 ,Team-BHP Support,"Damn, I knew they are going to go for premium pricing, but the higher variants (especially) are overpriced. I thought Skoda will keep a fair premium, considering there is some cost-cutting in the car (e.g. plastics lower down in the cabin, standard sunroof instead of panoramic, misaligned stitching, basic reversing cam and no 360 view etc.). Vid6639 & me just had a discussion on the launch and he thinks its 1.5 lakhs overpriced. Skoda has priced most of its newer launches for fat profits & the Kushaq is no different. Anyone who sees the Kushaq's lack of presence in person and the 20+ lakh OTR price is definitely in for serious sticker shock . The other major disadvantage versus the Korean twins is the narrow rear seat (3 adults is impossible). You know what else is sad? That the ATs don't get 6 airbags. Now, this is just a braindead move in a market that loves its ATs. More than the price, something like this will cost them sales. However, if I were the CEO of Skoda India, I would go for the same kind of pricing. Reason: Skoda's thin dealership network + lack of a diesel + terrible after-sales reputation means the Kushaq was never going to be an 8000 / month car. Now, if you can currently sell just 3000 - 3500 units / month, would you sell a variant at 18.5 lakhs OTR or 20 lakhs (just an example). That additional 1.5 lakhs goes straight to the bottom line. Cars are not priced on the basis of cost; they are priced on the basis of the maximum that a customer will pay. How much more would you pay for a 4-star GNCAP car (my source is reasonably reliable, not 100% though) over a 2 - 3 star competitor? ESC is standard even on the base variant - how much would you pay for ESP? How much more would you pay for driving one of the most fun crossovers (although new Creta / Seltos are also loads of fun)? And like it or not, the Skoda brand has some premium'ness in India (definitely more premium than a Hyundai). The brand will charge some extra money for the badge. I always overpay for good used cars & Viddy overpaid 4 lakhs for his Kodiaq. After so many years of happy ownership, ask any of us if we regret shelling out that extra money? The answer is no. In fact, the number 1 reason any Kushaq owner will regret his purchase is not because of the inflated price tag, but because of the brand's shoddy long-term reliability & pathetic dealerships. No one I know has ever regretted paying a lakh or two more for a good car (Kushaq 1.5L is a ""great"" car IMHO). But 8 / 10 owners who suffer poor reliability regret their purchase decision. Not that it makes a difference to the customer, but I believe the 1.5L turbo-petrol is not localised, contributing further to the price. Another point that shouldn't matter to the customer, although I think is a contributor here = dealer viability. Unlike Hyundai, several Skoda dealers are suffering financially. Am willing to bet that the margin on a same price Kushaq is higher than the Creta's. The biggest deal-breaker to me and my biggest disappointment today is that the automatics have just 2 airbags.

Creta was an already well established & extremely successful brand name and hence the market accepted its ridiculous pricing (yes, new creta is overpriced by a few lakhs!). To believe Kushaq would sell at the same price is just Skoda being too optimistic, may be even a little foolish. But knowing the eagerness(or the lack of) of Skoda to sell cars in good numbers, I am sure they will be content with selling 1500 units a month, which kushaq definitely will attain, even at this pricing. Koreans offer better features set and a very economical 1.5 diesel mill. It's eventually going to be safety vs (features + fuel economy) for the 20 lakh compact SUV buyer.

You can’t seat 3 adults at the back, but gave proper 3 point seat belts, but hei, the top end guys can get the whack from a side crash because we dont give a damn about your money, so no side airbags for you. 2. 1.4L premium over MT for the AT, but with missing airbags, missing TPMS and lets see what else they have cut out. 3. Sunroof only on the Style(by calling a small sunroof a panaromic doesn’t make it a panaromic). 4. The 1.0TSI is marginally slower than Venue/Sonet in both AT and MT configuration.

We usually bash Indians and Koreans, but have a sweet spot for Europeans, even with their untested made in India cars.

I'm on the side of people who would prioritise safety over other things and had high expectations from the Kushaq. 3-point seatbelts all around and ESC as standard are very, very welcome. However, there's a lot to disappoint. First, 2 airbags. They're not a feature anymore, they're a Government requirement. It's definitely not what one expects in a modern 18-lakh rupee crossover from a safety-conscious brand. I was disappointed enough at 2 standard airbags - now it's been confirmed that you can't equip any automatic variant with side airbags either. Even the current automatic Rapid and Vento can be equipped with upto 4 airbags. So can the Renault Triber at half the price. The reason this disappoints me is because the Kushaq has the potential to be the next 4-5 star car to be available with side head and thorax airbags (currently all we have is the XUV300 which doesn't have a proper automatic). I also don't see seatbelt pretensioners in the brochure for inexplicable reasons. I'm not sure if it's safe to assume all variants have them. I hope the line in the brochure that shows all variants have a middle lap belt for rear occupants is a misprint. If this is what it takes to sell an SUV, at a not-so-good price at that, no, thank you. I'd rather have a Honda City with 4 airbags and every other safety feature the Kushaq offers (well, except multi-collision braking, and we don't know which has the better structure) for 43 grand more than the Kushaq Active.

Many of us expected Skoda to price the Kushaq from 9.99 lacs to 15.99 lacs and a big disappointment making us to hate Skoda and Kushaq. To be frank, I too expected 1.5 TSI MT to be priced within 17 lacs on road bangalore. If we stop and think about it the pricing are not that bad compared to Creta/Seltos. Most of us are ok to pay bit more for Skoda than Hyundai or Kia. Yes, I agree there is no comparison on feature list on Kushaq with Korean twins. But features were never an USP for Skoda cars except Superb and still managed to sell dated cars in quite numbers. Rapid saw 3 generations of Hyundai Verna and we know which one we choose for a drive. However, reality is different. A Skoda/VW car will never ever outsell any Hyundai/Kia cars atleast in India. The truth is Skoda/VW knows this too. They never aimed for Hyundai/Kia volumes with Kushaq, they will be aiming atleast 2.5k to 3k sales per month which is a blockbuster for the brand.

Or at least, for just about every audience, there seems to be a better alternative unless you are specifically obsessed with a European brand with these dimensions i.e. unless you specifically want a Skoda/Volkswagen of this particular size/form factor and engine combo, it’s hard to see why anyone wouldn’t pick from a number of alternatives - Creta/Seltos for their turbo petrol engine and overall interior, Harrier/Hector for the turbo diesel manual and size and presence and plusher interiors, or even the TRoc for the same 1.5 engine but far superior interiors and CBU at a relatively small premium. Not to mention the incredible value that the Honda City now seems to offer in comparison, more than ever (I refer to a sedan because the Kushaq seems closer to a hatchback on steroids than an MUV let alone SUV). The only people I can see for whom this is the only option are those who want a Creta/Seltos but refuse to buy one due to braking/safety concerns or aesthetics. And tangentially, because six months ago this is one of the cars we briefly considered waiting for (along with the Safari, Alcazar and new XUV), I have to say I’m still delighted we went with the 2021 Hector Plus auto top end at 18.8 before the last price hike. Y’know one is always wondering if one will fall prey to buyer’s remorse - not one bit here.

Last time when I drove from Bangalore to Coimbatore (in April 2021), I spotted ~ 50+ Rapids from the time I entered the city to my home and I was actually amazed. That was the time I was seriously considering an upgrade with a budget of ~15 L. Requirements were simple, Should be either a Honda, VW or Skoda. Should have a reliable auto transmission, seating for 4 adult and a kid, boot space of ~ 400 L, good service network in Bangalore. Though I had Kushak in my list, I went ahead and booked The New Honda City. (I like sedans more than the SUV's).

These views may change with my driving the car as well as the myriad of car testers and reviewers who are doing intense and detailed tests of the two this very moment! My key points of observation based on analyzing the features that the top end turbocharged petrols endowed with speed DSG auto boxes are as below Final Comments: Though the two top of the line turbocharged petrol models with 7 speed DSG auto boxes are similarly priced and bring in similar value as well 1. The Creta brings in more value with safety features like 6 airbags and all 4 wheel disc brakes. 2. Though the rear passenger space is greater in the Kushaq, the Creta makes up for it with a bigger boot. 3. Comfort features wise both are well-matched with features such as ventilated front seats, the top class entertainment system with 10 inch touchscreens, etc. 4. Size wise the Kushaq is a fist shorter and less wide than the Creta 5. The Creta has that brilliant panoramic sunroof that the Kushaq has given a miss 6. The Kushaq engines are a tad superior to the ones in the Creta by a margin of around 5% in power and also bring in technology like Active Cylinder Technology which switches off 2 of the 4 cylinders when the load is low or when you are cruising so that you can save on precious fuel! Overall I don't see too much of a value difference between the two and buyers should take a call on the lack of which features are deal-breakers for them, test both the cars and make an informed judgment Viewers can make changes to the value that I have attributed to the various features and come to their own conclusions.

However, leaving aside the price, after checking the team bhp review and few video reviews on Youtube, there is NO objective reason to really like the Kushaq over the competition. For a 20Lakh car, not having 6 airbags, TPMS and rear disc brakes when safety could have been the only USP of this car looks like a self-goal. On top of it, the analog MID looks at least a decade old and similar to my Vento which is such a turn off in today's world (Honestly, if there is one thing I could change in the Vento, it would be the analog speedo and MID. I just hate it and you can't avoid it as it is always in your face ). Electric seats is a deal breaker for me considering the segment/price point. Also, the touch and slide AC controls are an absolute no-no for me. Other than these deal breakers, there are numerous compromises made - No underbody protection on a SUV??? No panaromic sunroof No electronic parking brake No paddle shifters Smallish boot Less space for 5th passenger. Extremely dull looking door pads No one touch for the 4 power windows Lot of cheap plastics all around No fancy features like 360 camera or air purifier etc. As I said above, apart from the people who are fans of 'European build and finesse', this is not going to find any takers. Apart from the handling (subjective), the only USP could have safety but we don't have the NCAP crash test results and on top of it, SKoda has removed side/curtain airbags from the topmost variant.

A set of buyers may not agree with the pricing strategy of Skoda for Kushaq, while another set won't mind paying this price. But, the missing safety and feel-good features, will affect both these groups. The price for a Skoda product, is ok. But for this price, if the features offered are bare minimum, then there is a problem. Of late, all new skoda launches are feature-rich and as usual they are sturdy and have never skimped on safety elements. It has put Skoda above the Korean / Japanese players. Here it looks like the marketing research is done by their competitors. I still feel Skoda isn't clear about their product-positioning. It's neither here nor there segment. Either they should have built a product, with elements, at par or above the Seltos / Creta tribe, then they could have even hiked the price by 50 / 100 K, it was par for the course. Here, this product in terms of features / interior is unlike a recent launched skoda, and trying to be in mass segment with premium pricing, is unfathomable. Though the torque and power might be comparable to the Korean siblings, competing with 3-pot 1.0 engine, along with a noticeably smaller foot-print, isn't really an intelligent move. Had I been Zac Hollis, either I won't enter mass segment or if I decide to be a player in this zone, I will give all possible features the competitors offer, apart from the renowned Skoda engine and transmission. Then I would have had the audacity to say 'The King has arrived'. Because Skoda has to bear in mind the so-called 'friendly' service centres. I do drive an 1.8 TSI Octy and love the driving dynamics and I was in the hunt to buy Kushaq for my wife. The size was perfect for me as it was replacing our second car, but even before the price was disclosed, I was a bit apprehensive about missing features. Now, I feel that a good product has been given the stick. Again, Zac, if possible sack your market research company and the team who gave you this idea of pricing for this product. Will I buy another Skoda product? Of course I will, if you give me compelling reasons to buy one.

The Kushaq 1.0L if anything like the Rapid, is exact opposite. Supremely revv happy, brilliant mid range and an effortless cruiser with 6 gears. Personally, if I didn't have so many cars already, I would sell my Corolla Altis and Ecosport and get a Kushaq 1.0L AT which replaces both into 1 car. My only gripe is that damn stupidity of Skoda to give only 2 airbags in the Kushaq AT!

As per this very forum's official review, the mass market Seltos in 1.4DCT and 1.5 diesel AT rank high in driving and handling. Only after the GNCAP ratings came out, the otherwise loud thud sound gave way to a rude and inexplicable unstable shell. Since Kushaq in AT doesn't have 6 airbags and hasn't been crash tested yet, we don't know about how safe it is. And I will love to understand from the mods about the difference on handling and drive in the discerning Kushaq vis a vis mass market Seltos. And if within a year, we have lower stripped versions and/or discounts start rolling in, will the theory about niche and discerning Skoda still hold? Right or wrong, a manufacturer may price a product as per his own interests. And we may have different takes on pricing. But what I am not able to fathom is how can lesser sales due to optimistic pricing and lesser than exclusive features lead to this idea of ""Skoda versus mass market"" brand proposition.

Having the base variant below 10L would provide a major advantage from OTD point of view for the customers, specially in states like Karnataka, However skoda is always a premium brand and should position themselves so. But Kushaq does not have any premium identity compared to it's Korean twins.

Dear Skoda, people also are simply clever these days with clear understanding of rival products and open minded acceptance towards various body types and brands, provided they see value in the offering.

351, abhishek_hch , 19:19 ,BHPian,"As expected, Skoda ends up maintaining a premium in the pricing for most of this range. For most of us woke car buyers and drivers, Skoda may not be a premium brand with many known issues with ASS. However, for the average Joe (who doesn't even know of NCAP test or build quality), it still retains it's premium & aspirational value. Most of the mass market segment sales comes from such people only. I was myself unaware of this premium and looked at Skoda as a problematic brand but have since met enough people who really look at it as a premium brand. No brand will destroy that premium, be it toothpaste or a car. It would be suicidal. Skoda is able to sell cars priced Rs. 30 Lacs well - something which the market leaders have not been able to do, so it was expected that it will keep that premium-ness intact with the pricing. I personally expected Kushaq to be priced from Rs. 11 lacs to a few grands above Selots/Creta. Its mostly like that. The base version is priced well, in fact a bit aggressively. If compared to Creta/Seltos base variant, it has more safety features and creature comforts, so the premium of Rs. 50k is perfectly justified. Perhaps Skoda missed a trick here by not offering an even more bare boned version like competition and price it at Rs. 9.99 lac levels. Its from the base variant upwards that the prices become a bit stiff. In the next version Style, one gets the following additional features- Alloy wheels LED headlamps Fog lamps & Ambient Lighting Rear wiper & defogger Rear window child locking Rear foldable seats Drive seat height adjustment Rear Armrest Steering wheel leather 10"" touchscreen My Skoda Auto climate control Rear AC vents One touch and anti pinch windows Dead pedal 4 dial MID Cruise control Rear Parking Cameras Cooling glovebox Shark fin antenna Rear Parcel Shelf Sunglass holder Few other cosmetic embellishments But is all of it worth a price increase worth Rs. 2.4 lacs. Definitely no! A rise of Rs. 1.25-1.5 lacs, yes! This is clearly overpriced by 1 lac (presumably for brand premium). Similarly, the difference between auto and manual is around 1.5 lacs while Seltos and Creta operate at 1 lac kind of difference. So all higher variants are definitely overpriced. Absence of 6 airbags on the top end variant is a big, big, big miss and hopefully will be corrected soon. I had junked the idea of buying a Seltos HTK+ Diesel Auto priced at Rs. 13.95 lacs after the GNCAP ratings and was looking at 1.0 AT Style. I was expecting it to be priced at Rs. 13-13.5 lacs. Its priced higher, but I think I would still go for it. For Rs. 24k more I will get a host of things. Primary being -Better body build Better handling and dynamics Host of safety features like ESC, Hill Assist, Multi Collision Brake Paddle shifters Headrest in back seat ISOFIX 60:40 split seats Some bells and whistles like-LED headlamps Rear Armrest 10"" touchscreen Auto climate control Cooling glovebox The major con for me would be the lack of space in the rear seat but I think mostly I would still go that way. Seeing the (expected) criticism of pricing here, not sure how many will buy this Hopefully, enough to keep Skoda afloat in India. I will be watching the numbers closely. Pricing is a very subjective thing. Some one may think ""I wont buy the cars without XYZ features at this price point"". The other guy may think ""I won't buy a car with a weak body structure at this price point"". Its completely subjective. There is no one size fits all. Let us see how many are there here for this car which is evidently positioned for the safety conscious and driving enthusiasts.

Between 10-20L, there simply isn't any automatic high seated car that can give 5 star rated safety. The game has moved on and if space/safety combo is needed, you need to cross the 20L barrier. So either I should be spending 20L upwards or take the likes of Sonet to save some money. There is no point in taking a car costing more than Sonet delivering similar power, seating same number of folks with similar safety. 4.

Is it because I watched too many 90's films during the lockdown? So as per the Kushock prices, the variant that I was aiming would come close to 20 lakhs OTR in my state . It has 2 airbags and the Times YouTube review shows a mileage of 6 kmpl which they say can go up to 9-10 kmpl if driven properly. This was supposed to have better FE than the 1.0 due to the cylinder deactivation tech. Most of the video reviews opine that the interiors quality is not that great.

I say that Octavia, Rapid, Superb are the actual Skoda's and this Kushaq is actually more Skoda'ish. A lot of cost-cutting has gone into this product. Given the bad ASS, not-so-trustworthy reliability, and high maintenance cost issues of Skoda in India, I definitely expected the price of Kushaq to be at least 50K less than its rivals. Or at least Skoda should have given the actual german quality and experience with 1-1.5 lakhs more expensive offering. The current pricing is neither that side nor this side is a disadvantage to Skoda by being completely neutral and not giving the pure Skoda experience to a Skoda fan. Attracting newbies to the Skoda brand through Kushaq will probably give a negative impact due to the stringent and strict cost-cutting evidence on the product itself. Definitely, Kushaq WILL take an insignificant share of the pie from Korean siblings which is more reliable, more pocket-friendly and has one of the best ASS and network. But is it a game-changer?

391, RavenAvi , 21:51 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Allow me to put forward a different opinion here. I think Skoda India have done their homework. They realise that they cannot simply take over the position that Hyundai/Kia have carved for themselves in the past 15-odd years overnight. For a car which offers a package comparable to the Creta/Seltos (give or take a few exclusive features), the Kushaq is a good option with the 1.0L TSI at the prices where the 1.5L average-performing Korean NA variants have slotted themselves in. Yes, the mid and top variants are a bit overpriced (50K-75K, IMO) but that is where most sales come from, and Skoda is aiming to score a bit from there. As a mechanical package, the Kushaq is a compelling option over the Korean twins and with good engineering to boot. Sure, some plastics and liners are not of the quality Skoda is known for, but the car is very, very heavily localised. Inherently, the Kushaq has retained the underpinnings of a typical Skoda car in terms of performance and ride quality, and this is where Skoda hopes to cash in with the Kushaq. But, where they have abysmally lost the plot, is the feature list for the top ATs. I have always been a firm believer that similar variant names should have similar equipment lists, and more often than not, Hyundai India themselves has been the culprit of providing more features on a Creta SX AT (for example) over a Creta SX MT, which, quite frankly, is not acceptable (except for the change in transmission, but of course). So, the same features available on the Style MT but not in the Style AT is quite baffling and mind-boggling, specially when the features are passive-safety related and are so crucial on our absolutely unpredictable roads. And, no diesel. For a compact SUV which reminds one of performance when you see the badge on the grille up front, not giving a diesel to the Kushaq is like tying a boxer's right hand behind him, right before a fight. What are the brains in product management smoking, I wonder. Yes, the Kushaq will not set the sales charts on fire, but if it can pull off ~2,000 units a month, that too as a petrol-only offering, it's a moderate success. All this when Skoda horror stories, unpredictable transmissions and dealerships, eye-watering spare part prices and questionable ownership experiences are taken into account. Let's see what the future holds for the car in sales numbers in 6 months' time before burying it. And please, in an era where i20/Baleno prices are touching 11L+ and a Tata Nexon is nearing 15L in some cities, overpricing shouldn't be a worry. I don't think there's any such thing as VFM anymore. Even Maruti-Suzuki has been jacking up prices of their cars every 3 months these days - check the prices of a Swift or DZire top-end now. Let's not bring Hyundai into the equation - they have been masters at overpricing their most popular offerings from Day 1 itself.

Or is your argument that discerning buyers should only buy the ""of classical euro bro"" VAG cars or they are all, the 10's of thousands of them not discerning and informed buyers? The fact of the matter is these cars offer great vfm, highly competent engines, slick gearboxes (auto or manual), a huge and Reliable sales and after sales networks.

Best way is to ignore people who are trying to force their views onto others. So let's all take a chill pill and agree to disagree. Now back to the prices. At 11am when I was saw the price reveal I was very disappointed. Again, these are just my views. 1. The Kushaq has a minor size disadvantage compared to the Creta/Seltos, and overall the tight design makes it look smaller than them. So the least Skoda should have done was price it at 9.99 L an an introductory offering. 2. The Seltos HTE (diesel) retails at 10.45 L ex.showroom. So I can't understand why Skoda would price the 1.0 tsi at a same range. Yes the Kushaq is not actually bare bones, but keep in mind for the same money you get a slightly roomier/larger car and a diesel motor. 3. Is Skoda only making products for their fan base alone? If they only want the enthusiasts to buy their products then they've lost the plot. Not everyone in India wants a corner carver. Some people are happy with just the basics. The Seltos might have messed up on the safety aspect, but its covered the other bases pretty well. 4. I'm not going into the horror stories of Skoda ASS but we all know its part of the package. So why go the premium price route Skoda? 5. Couldn't Skoda learn from the Magnite/Kiger strategy? For many people, in the current financial situation the bottom line is all that matters. Skoda had their own Rider versions do decent number because of aggressive pricing. How could they not learn from that pricing strategy? When you play catch up or when you're going up against established market leaders you have to work on smaller margins, and I feel like Skoda didn't do this here. Mark my words, Skoda will have to do pricing revisions once the initial hype has died out and the sales numbers speak for themselves. For the sake of Skoda, I hope I'm proven wrong.

That sunroof video from Evo was hilarious. There's no way anyone will pull the headliner like that to check for flex. In the Ecosport the sunroof design has a additional beading around the headliner cut out vs the Skoda which is more flush. This is a mere difference of design and not quality or cost cutting as being highlighted. I've seen definition of rattles being different. Even maruti owners say no rattles. Rattles can be any squeaks, creaks over roads as well as resonance at rpm's due to parts getting loose. You will find plenty in the Ecosport simply due to clips breaking over time. It's way better than Maruti but VW cars like Polo, Vento and Rapid are far superior. This is similar as per our review. I will confirm when I check out the car when crowds are lesser and they come for a drive. Quote: By no means is the Ecosport a comfortable 5 seater, but from whatever pictures I saw in some journos reviews, where they seat 3 adults on the rear bench, it clearly is visible that the third person in very uncomfortable on the bench in Kushaq. Relatively, IMO, my mom (healthy build), sis and BIL (healthy build) seat much more comfortably on the rear bench in ecosport. Maybe as the Ecosport is wider than Kushaq, the interior space could be a bit better? The external width difference is not much and I believe internal will be same. But the difference is in way seat is designed. Ford has kept a flat seat base and back rest but the Kushaq like all Euro cars has countours and 2 distinct buckets. This is what make it look less wider and when people sit they are pushed more inwards. So yes might be less comfortable but again that was the case with Octavia and T-ROC as well. Quote: Ecosport gets the dynamic guidelines, with much better camera display. Is this in the SYNC system or the other one? SYNC was good the other not at all. Quote: I agree ride quality over broken roads is pathetic in Ecosport. But stated earlier, I was talking only about the fun to drive factor. Me and dad are prepared to forego the ride quality, if the car offers the best high speed manners and steering is a delight. Actually again, stiff ride doesn't mean great handling. They don't go hand in hand. Indian roads need a suspension that doesn't lose composure on mid corner bumps. The Ecosport gets totally unsettled when it hits a bump mid corner and this affects both handling and high speed manners. Quote: Also I didn't meant to say the Ecosport to be a better car. It's just the overall parameters we have compared for both cars, and IMO, I simply don't find paying premium of over 3L for the Kushaq Style AT. I think this perception will change hugely when you go and drive or sit in a Kushaq. The problem is on paper the Kushaq looks less impressive and the Ford more impressive.

These people barely even consider anything not German, hence I put forth my case that the pricing will help Skoda either way in serving the people who once wanted something that offered as much car as the Seltos/Creta/Harrier but were taken aback by the thought of moving to what they find inferior. That brings me to the fact that price isn't a planted issue wherein the Kushaq is concerned. The people who want it, will buy it at a premium. What really pinches is the undue advantage being taken of this set of buyers by bidding farewell to vitals and feel-goods (which really should be there at the proposed segment). It's not that homework hasn't been done by Skoda, it's rather overdone, with too much faith in these buyers which has led them into the decision to subsequently remove features in their new launches. Variant discrimination between Automatic and Manual for features like airbags was last observed in the Hyundai Grand i10 in the Asta variant where the Automatic didn't get airbags.

423, One , 01:29 ,BHPian,"The Kushaq is supposed to be the car that saves Skoda. Can it achieve this now that the details on paper are available (this post is not whether the car suits me or meets some specific requirements): One way we can model this is to use Creta/ Seltos as a base and see where Kushaq lands. The Creta sold ~7500 units last month whereas the Seltos sold ~4200 (the Venue sold ~4800 and Sonet did ~6600 but we can ignore them for multiple reasons here, primary being that those numbers are less than Seltos which we want to focus on here). Reference Considering a pessimistic scenario, let's use the Seltos sales numbers as our base. Monthly Sales (May 21) - 4200 Approximate Petrol Sales at 60% (reference for 60%) - 2520 Around 40-50% of this is 1000-1200 cars a month. Less than this might not be enough to sustain the company. So the questions are: - Do we think Skoda can do 1000-1200 units a month - Is that a number which helps Skoda as a manufacturer in the country (also keep in mind India will be used as a base to export this model) I personally think it can do these numbers. I don't see absence of 6 air-bags as an issue for the market (if braking issues of a best selling car are not an issue, then this certainly isn't). I don't see ASS as an issue , atleast initially (Magnite sales as an example). The only things I see going against it for big numbers are: - Size and this doesn't refer to it being a 4 seater. It refers to physical attributes, doesn't look like a ""baaaadi gaadi"" which Creta/Seltos look like and doesn't look butch like an EcoSport. - Bling like sunroof. This is a feature that announces ""arrival"" to a certain segment, much like Honda City did years back. 1000-1200 units though should be easy, this segment has enough buyers. If it had been a sedan segment going with this kind of pricing against the best sellers, I would have had a different opinion. But the number of people buying cars in this segment should ensure these numbers. For me, the only question is, what is the number of units to be sold monthly for Skoda to consider it a hit or even to sustain itself here. And of course, can Skoda improve its ASS, or.....maybe....is DQ200 trouble free ", 29th June 2021,skoda-kushaq,Mumbai,245,"1,210",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

426, Trex5151 , 03:14 ,Newbie,"Disclaimer: A long rant. After the initial reviews and price reveal most of the Bhpians seem to be disappointed with the car not meeting their expectations and you can add me to that group too. I was really looking forward to this car as a candidate to replace my Dad's 7 year old Elite i20. With the compromises Skoda has made with the car I don't think they can justify pricing it on par with the Korean twins. 1. It is noticeably smaller than both the Creta and Seltos. We can argue that it's got a better build and safety. Ok so no points lost here. 2. If the reviews are anything to go by, the interior quality is not up to the mark. Especially when the twins have their biggest advantage here. Few say these can be fixed in the aftermarket. But should they? Just like how GTO says factory horses are factory horses, factory fit is factory fit. 3. Doesn't match the twins on features offered. 4. GTO says a reliable source claims a 4* GNCAP. That is not enough. It has to be a 5* rated car day in and day out. If Tata can make a 4* car for 7 lakhs and 5* rated cars for 10 lakhs what's stopping a global powerhouse like VAG to offer a 5* rated car at 20 lakhs especially when their own decade old cars(Polo, Vento and Rapid) are already 4* rated at half the price. Yes we can bring up Seltos's disaster rating but just because the bar is low it doesn't mean being one step over it is enough. 5. Skoda's infamous ASS. If we are to look over these drawbacks(especially ASS), Kushaq has to offer something way above the Korean twins to justify it's positioning. Some might say it has better driving dynamics. But the twins aren't far back. In fact they are very very close. So what is its redeeming feature? And how deep are the changes to have an Indian market specific chassis code? What's actually Indianized? Trim/plastic quality? Suspension and drivetrain tuning? Or any structural changes like the Korean twins? Why can't we have a truly global crossover at this price when the previous gen global Octavia was offered for not a lot more that this.

Since I don't want to buy Korean twins due to safety issues and not that interested in Harrier and Hector for their bloated looks. Also, decent variant of diesel Compass is way beyond my 20 Lakhs budget. Hence, I have been waiting for Kushaq from last 6 months. I feared of this day when Skoda will let us down and it came true. The pricing could be justified and I would have paid this price for a smaller compact car in its segment, if: 1) Skoda had not given inferior quality interiors 2) offered 6 airbags + TPMS in top trim 3) Offered digital instrument cluster (current looks like the one I have on my 2017 elite i20) 4) LED head and tail lights instead of halogen bulbs 5) Pan ""glass"" roof, like one offered in Kamiq Monte Carlo 6) Better cushioning in seats and good fit seat covers 7) Front parking sensors and 360 camera (O) 8) Electric Parking brake, electric seats, Remote on /off, sporty seats, better alloys with thick tire profile, etc (not important, can live without these) I doubt Skoda will address any of these in next facelift (which includes wait time of 12months) or Monte Carlo variant (indefinite wait).

Škoda also used the specific MQB A0 platform and largely involved local suppliers Quote: One would logically expect, therefore, that if one wants to succeed with him as much as he claims, he will bring the price down to a truly affordable level. However, this happened and did not happen, as Kushaq starts at 1,049,000 rupees (approximately 302,000 CZK). Quote: In general, this is not much, with us you can't even buy a basic Fabia for this amount (CZK 329,900), moreover, it is much less than with a Škoda Kamiq (CZK 417,900). However, it should be noted that the average wage in India is INR 31,900 (CZK 9,200). So we have 3.8 times lower income, but only a quarter lower price. So the average Indian has to save for Kushaq for almost thirty-three months, almost three years. In contrast, in the case of Hyundai Creta, which starts at 999,990 INR (288,250 CZK), it will tighten its belt for a slightly shorter time. Quote: So we are curious about how the news will turn out. Especially when the Indians can buy a Rapid next to it, for example, which will allow them to take up to 460 liters of cargo for 779,000 INR (224 thousand CZK). So Kushaq is handsome and has received relatively modern architecture, but it does not fit into the possibilities of Indian customers.

While I understand the price overlap between Nexon/Venue/Sonet and Creta/Seltos, the Kushaq should rightly fall in the second bracket, given its price/dimension/engine options. Deliberately or mistakenly, it appears that the Skoda management has got the positioning of the Kushaq wrong. If you think about the market, there are a couple of things that we need to keep in mind. This has been discussed multiple times before that most/average Indian buyers 1. Prefer established brands/products which they see all around, despite 6-12 month waiting (Case in point - Creta, others). Maybe some reinforcement that their decision is not wrong since there are many others who have chosen the same. 2. Are not enthusiasts, and care more about creature comforts and cool features, fit and finish than about driving pleasure. 3. Would prefer peace of mind with good support based on volumes, which in turn make for cheaper spares and extensive service networks. Now, since the Kushaq size or image (overall size, boot) is not in same segment as the Seltos/Creta segment, the natural tendency would be to compare to next lower segment, at which the Skoda pricing doesn't make sense, and on top, you get more features and peace of mind at a lower price point.

While I understand the price overlap between Nexon/Venue/Sonet and Creta/Seltos, the Kushaq should rightly fall in the second bracket, given its price/dimension/engine options. Talking about dimension, it's only the length which exceeds Sonet. This translates into a better wheelbase (a bit more kneeroom than Sonet), but the Kushaq has both lesser width and height than the Sonet. It is clear from the reviews that sitting 3 at the back isn't an option (so is the case with Sonet). Sonet also offers more boot space than Kushaq. So while it does fall in a segment above, the boundaries are bleak. Some of the subcompact SUVs like Nexon and XUV300 offer more shoulder room at the back because of their width. Where Kushaq could have differentiated and justified the pricing are the features and ""premiumness"" on offer, but then, it is hard to beat the Sonet in that department. So what one gets with the Sonet is a car of almost equal space, a huge number of engine and transmission options, more features at a lesser price.

460, sramanat , 11:48 ,BHPian,"As expected this thread became highly polarizing since the price reveal yesterday. What the car has going on for it - (perceived, I must say) apparent great driving dynamics, European build and overall 'put together well' and an objective set of safety features across variants. What it has going against it - pricing (perceived), space (objectively smaller), electronic gizmos and missing airbags in the AT variants (both objective). From a business PoV, the general consensus is that the car was expected to bring volumes to Skoda. The average CSUV buyer is looking to buy a roomy (read ability to pack a kid and grandparents in the rear), easy to drive (read AT or the ability to have the spouse drive), fuss-free (fuel and maintenance bills), go-anywhere (higher GC to navigate potholed roads) car packed with bling (digital dials, panoramic sunroof and the works). In other words, a quintessential family car. On that count, the car offers less than the competition in terms of features, space and bling, but is priced at par. How much will the European build, fit & finish and FTD quotient make up for this loss is something we need to wait for the market to respond. My gut feel is that the car will be a middling success among Skoda fans and resounding failure outside that demographic. Reasons - 1. It is hard to believe drivers looking for a FTD car will settle for a CSUV. There's the rapid, decidedly acclaimed, cheaper and offers 2 extra airbags to boot. Or wait for the Rapid's replacement with the same set of engine/transmission combo. 2. In terms of roominess and airbags, the car doesn't even bring the table stakes, let alone a differentiating proposition. 3. A few reviews including t-bhp have mentioned the difficult to operate clutch, making the MT with additional airbags a hard sell. 4. Whether this is offers a fuss-free ownership is yet to be seen, but it takes a certain amount of balls to commit the equivalent of an apartment's down payment, this early in the launch. Kia had the advantage of Hyundai's presence and implicit underwriting, which sadly VW/Skoda cannot claim. These are based on implicit assumptions on the target demographic. In all likelihood the Skoda execs are betting on a different, hitherto unknown/unapparent demographic. Whether it brings in the money in expected (the forum's expectation could diverge from that of the management's) quantities is the ultimate test.

However I don't think it has to do with positioning of Kushaq. It has more to do with what Kia has done. Between Seltos and Sonet, the latter is a well rounded design compared to Seltos. So, the buyers are split by their affinity to bling- more bling=Seltos, less=Sonet. Seltos buyers are anyway not looking at Kushaq, because it is not flashy enough, while the Sonet buyers do. Secondly, top of the line Sonet makes sense to a group of people, who would go for a feature-packed version than opt for bigger size.

Within a few days of launch, they realized that the lack of GTX+ in the DCT would hurt them. They immediately announced after the price reveal that bookings for GTX+ 7DCT were being taken. A month later price was announced (1 lakh more) and all was well. Existing bookings were allowed to change to GTX+ or someone who still wanted GTX was allowed to keep that. Skoda can do this as well. The Ambition to Style MT is 1.8 lakhs additional. But for the AT the Ambition to Style delta is 1.6 lakhs.

I think Zac Hollis will be transferred pretty soon at this rate of inconsistency in what he says and what he actually delivers! I don't think it's grammatic but in the way our market works these things really don't matter. A VFM car that can drive on four wheels is what overwhelming majority and by implication the market wants. (No offence to anyone, individual choice). For a overwhelming majority, seat belts are a nuisance to be taken off at first available opportunity, 99.9% kids are driven around in laps/standing on seats, kids peeping out of sunroofs on speeding joyrides is a common sight, sitting with legs on dashboard is considered cool, the probability of any rear passenger wearing a seat belt is lower than that of sighting a solar eclipse! It doesn't take a pundit to conclude that safety isn't actually very high in priority list for us, whether due to lack of awareness or a conscious choice no one knows. Hyundai and Kia obviously realise this & cut down on the material used for the shell to bring cost down (clearly evident from their overseas versions of Creta, Seltos vis-a-vis Indian ones). No one is condoning the lack of airbags on top spec. But as already pointed out, that would be something around the corner & kept in abeyance just to escape the whip lashes.

487, TheVegabond , 14:06 ,BHPian,"Wow, it seems that this discussion will go on for the days to come. The reason why the discussion is such a heated one is because a lot of people (including me) were looking at Kushaq as a worthy alternative to Creta/Seltos. Skoda on their part made a hype by saying it is going to be a car targeted for Indian requirements. This created huge anticipation about the overall package the Kushaq could be. Then came the reviews and all agreed it is a great car but also revealed the usable cabin and boot space is closer to Sonet/Venue (sub4 meter is just a stupid rule) and Kushaq is 1 size too small in comparison to Creta/Seltos. Like it or not, size does matter and we Indians would kill for it. This in a sense is logical as most of us have 1 car in the family and more often than not would be traveling with 4-5 people on board with bags full of luggage (imagine traveling to an outstation wedding). And the price reveal simply burst the bubble that Skoda created over time. Having driven Polo, Vento and Rapid, I believe Kushaq will be safer and fun to drive in comparison to Hyundai/Kia stable. But these aspects alone won't cut it for Skoda. They should have either matched Creta/Seltos in terms of size and features with these prices or undercut the Creta/Seltos prices with the current size of the Kushaq. P.S.

I am sure every people aspiring a product in this price range (10-20 lakhs) would be having a set of criteria and based on that decision would be made. Whether Kushaq's pricing and positioning is meeting the expectations is an individual thing (with majority may find it to be slightly higher than the expectation) but what stays is the addition of an option in the range. Now people have something that it is different from overtly popular Koreans or rather not so popular/ relatively old products like Duster/ Kicks. So the comfort of extra options is increasing and very soon we would see new additions like from VW. I am very sure based on market response, Skoda would launch proper fully loaded automatic version or else that would be a blasphemy. At the same time MT is for those who seek fun. Potentially excellent engines paired with competent setup as per the reviews would ensure serious fun behind the wheels. If FTD is of paramount importance, Skoda has got the answer. There is hardly any serious flaw associated or mentioned with the product as of now. So even as an overall package, the car may end up pleasing its owners. 'Price correction vs people ready to pay extra for Skoda' will be something that needs to be seen. At the same time, the primary rivals are extremely competent as well.

This way, they are placed in the same ballpark segment by prospective customers looking at top end models of both. They have probably reserved the L&K variants of both the 1.0 TSI and 1.5 TSI AT variants for a future launch (probably in a month or two) which will have all the missing features in the AT such as 6 airbags, as well as features not launched yet, like the digital cockpit. The top end 1.5 DGS L&K will probably be priced at 20 lakhs ex-showroom. If they had launched it now, Kushaq will suffer the same fate as the recent Jeep Compass facelift launch, which made it a niche player due to its smaller size and much higher price compared to segment competitors, despite being extremely capable and a fantastic product. Each new launch these days it separating TATA and M&M from the overseas competitors. The latter are moving up the price ladder rapidly, offering less value for every rupee spent. The former are still launching reasonably priced and capable cars that have improved a lot in the last couple of years. When you compare what the Safari or Harrier offer for the price to what Skoda, Kia and Hyundai offer, it becomes quickly apparent that Indian manufacturers are getting better at the value equation. They are also on par or better technologically and in terms of safety, as the mStallion engine family from M&M proves.

497, skarthiksr , 14:56 ,BHPian,"I will list down my reasons for why I am disappointed with the pricing of the Kushaq. Many of these reasons might be due to my own incorrect assumptions and reasoning. Let me put it down anyways. Members, feel free to correct me on any points. 95% localization - This catchword was the main reason I expected an attractive price on the Kushaq. The entire Skoda management team has used this term multiple times in every interview/presentation. In fact, in one of the Twitter question on the Octavia, Zac responded that there is very minimal localization in the Octavia. I inferred that it could be the probable reason for the Octavia premium pricing and hoped for a better pricing in Kushaq. Rapid Rider pricing - Had Skoda not launched the Rapid Rider last year, I might have not had any expectation on an attractive pricing. Skoda did launch this variant at a price that was least expected out of a brand like Skoda and they did get a good response is what I feel. Whether they really sold good numbers or not is a different story, probably they were not able to scale up production, but I remember reading in our very own forum that one of the dealers mentioned a potential customer that if they are looking for Rider variant, they should not have any colour choices and should accept whatever they get because of the too high demand for the variant. So, I thought Skoda will strategize an an attractive pricing for 1.0 Active MT, Ambition MT and Ambition AT to get volumes and higher profit margin on the Style and 1.5 variants by making it dearer. Learnings from Nissan Kicks and Magnite - Nissan was ambitious with the Kicks and it did not make a big fortune for them. They went back to the table and gave a tremendous fightback with the Magnite. The service woes which Nissan had in the past was overcome by the attractive pricing of the Magnite. Based on multiple reports, Skoda also doesn't enjoy very great ASS. So, I thought they might take a small leaf out of Nissan's book to somewhat try to overcome their service issues with attracting pricing and win customers back who are staying away due to historical service issues. India 2.0 strategy and increase of sales/service outlets - Skoda projected a grand vision for India 2.0 and multi-crore investment. They are increasing the number of sales and service outlets in the recent months is what I read from Twitter updates. To me it looked like they are aggressive on their sales expansion relying heavily on the Kushaq to achieve volumes which I think is possible only if the pricing had been better. Well, now I am seriously not sure if they really need to open large number of sales/service points for the expected volumes of Kushaq. In summary, Kushaq is definitely going to be the ""go to"" car for all VW/Skoda enthusiasts who are looking for a car in this segment. But, will their vision of India 2.0 strategy succeed with just their own fan base is an open question which only time can tell.

I was eyeing the Style AT or manual variant of the 1.0. Just why we are expected to shell out so much for the top trim and still not have a choice of 6 airbags is inexplicable. And even if it's the manual, does Skoda really expect us to make those compromises they have done with the plastics, headliners, reverse parking camera, halogens instead of LED and so on.

Skoda did launch this variant at a price that was least expected out of a brand like Skoda and they did get a good response is what I feel. Whether they really sold good numbers or not is a different story, probably they were not able to scale up production, but I remember reading in our very own forum that one of the dealers mentioned a potential customer that if they are looking for Rider variant, they should not have any colour choices and should accept whatever they get because of the too high demand for the variant. So, I thought Skoda will strategize an an attractive pricing for 1.0 Active MT, Ambition MT and Ambition AT to get volumes and higher profit margin on the Style and 1.5 variants by making it dearer. We need to realise comparing the price of Kushaq which is a completely new car on a completely new platform to Rapid Rider which is a car based on a platform which is more than 10 years old is not a fair comparison. They have sold enough of those to have recovered all the initial costs of investment done in developing a brand new car and could price it so low because of the economies of scale. Kushaq on the other hand being a brand new car has to recover all those fixed costs and SUVs have always been more expensive / overpriced than their sedan counterparts here. No matter how low they price it initially, they could not have recovered these costs in 1/2 years by selling even at their maximum production capacity. It will only happen overtime and when they launch a couple of more cars on the MQB A0-IN Platform. Moreover, they can't increase their networks or production capacity overnight, so they probably chose to sell lesser cars at more margins, helping their dealers also survive. However, omitting features like one touch down on all four windows, airbags and TPMS on top automatics is the biggest blunder they did at launch, because of which they are facing most of the anger. As many people have said the top end model is yet to be launched which will probably reach close last year T-roc prices and is gonna be seriously overpriced.

It doesn’t make sense to compete with them on price. More specifically, Creta platform would be close to getting fully depreciated (automakers in India earlier used to depreciate models/ platforms over 200k units volume sale). There is no way Skoda can match the cost structure Hyundai operates at as regards Creta. How Skoda can play this game is by offering a product that is superior and let it be appreciated over time. This requires them to survive and play the long game. God forbid, if there is a race to the bottom, Skoda has no chance. Case in point - Octavia outsells Elantra despite the massive premium. Any other pricing strategy wrt Kushak could have invited a price war. This crossover segment has become very big with Creta, Seltos, Scross, Harrier, XUV500 and by little extension, Duster and Kicks. There is potential to further segment it. I am not sure if Kushak does that job. It makes the space more crowded. Purists on the forum may not agree, IMHO the Thar automatic nibbles into this segment. Most global automakers are far too worried about their electric future. They don’t have enough R&D budgets to invest in the current market needs in India. It will be a little unfair to expect anything path breaking or innovative from the industry in the near future. Indian auto makers therefore have an edge. India will electrify at least a few more years after the world does. They can also make more India specific investments delivering more bang for the R&D buck. I would be interested to see what M&M and Maruti have to offer next, but that’s for a different thread.

I dont know if I endorse this endeavour because to me it seems as if segments are nebulous abstract ideas not capable of precise delineation. Nevertheless, I will cautiously defer to the greater wisdom the folks here have to offer. I have a noob bunch of questions in this context with respect to the Nexon. If you compare the Tata Nexon XZ Plus S Petrol and the Kushaq 1.0L Active, both of which are apparently priced within ₹5,000 of each other ex-showroom, how would you pick between the two? Performance (numbers): On peak power the Nexon has an edge (118.3 bhp @ 5500 rpm versus 113.98 @ 5000-5500 rpm). On peak torque, the Kushaq has an edge (178Nm versus 170 Nm at the same range). The Nexon has 20% more displacement. To those who are familiar with Skoda engines and how they drive, or those who are familiar with both engines: How much of a difference do you think the actual driving will have? I suspect that Skodas MT gearbox will be superior to Tatas. So will the Kushaq be substantially more fun than the Nexon to drive? Also, isnt the 1.0L TSI engine known for significant turbolag? From a practical standpoint, does the Nexon have better low-range power making it easier to drive in the cities and also reducing the need for downshifting in all conditions? If those questions are resolved in favour of the Nexon (either substantially or in part), why should that not be the pick over the Kushaq? Even if the Kushaq is safer than the Nexon, it can only be marginally so, right? The Nexon isnt by any stretch of the imagination so unsafe as to be comprehensively beaten by another car on safety. Some people (like me) may disagree with the aesthetic choices Tata has made on the design of the Nexon. It is also possible that the material quality will be superior in the Kushaq even if it doesnt conform to Skodas traditionally high standards. The Nexon is roughly as spacious as the Kushaq. It is wider. Neither car can seat 3 comfortably at the back for long drives, but the Nexon can certainly do better. On features too, this trim of the Nexon seems to have the edge over the Kushaq.

Although both are naturally aspirated, vento feels marginally superior than creta in all dynamics especially handling and inspires alot of confidence while driving.

The overall build, the great audio setup, the feel of the leather wrapped steering ( even after 6 years ) in Vento is so great to touch and feel. I have a budget of 14-15 L as a upgrade from my vento and manual or automatic was never in my consideration.

A few days ago, I mentioned that Skoda may price it reasonably, maybe 1.0 AT ambition around 14.00 lacs, which turned out to be true; the only difference is that it's an ex-showroom price . Wishful thinking. The prices are definitely on the higher side, but now we cannot help much as it's not in our control. We just have to decide whether to buy or not. I currently own a Kicks 1.5 Litre petrol and pretty much happy with it, whether build quality, suspension setup or highway manners, everything is sorted. But missing an automatic so looking for one. Had high hopes with Kushaq's 1.0 Litre ambition, torque converter but it's at least 1.7 lacs more than my budget. Have a strict budget of 15 lacs (OTR).

If Skoda India really wants to taste the desired success for their ambitious India 2.0 project, with such initial mixed feedback based on the premium pricing, first of Octavia and now of Kushaq, they simply need to improve on their approach towards their own customers. No any other short-cut could be helpful, I guess. Sometimes I think, the recent accident of Kia Seltos near Nagpur might have fuelled some 'extra' confidence within 'Team Skoda' to price Kushaq on higher side in comparison with the competition. The solid build quality and safe practicality of Skoda cars are in deed much talked about things and also well accepted by the Indian customers by now. However, to write some long term success stories in real life, Skoda highly needs to work hard on transforming their age-old general public perception regarding high maintenance/ ownership cost and the infamous after sale service. IMO, Kushaq surely will get sizable number of customers initially and this early response itself would create required buzz to further achieve the sales numbers. But the key to further success, highly and entirely depends on the approach adopted by the dealerships. Without their customer-friendly impression henceforth, NO any remarkable success is possible for Skoda.. Change is the only constant !

An average buyer would never realise such omissions(importance of it too on safety)and that's exactly what these manufacturers cash in.

Problem is that we compare the car prices with what we paid 5-6 years ago for our last car. Inflation adjusted price of base model Honda city is still less than what is used to be in 2015. Inflation of car prices is highly correlated with with fuel prices which is taxed at north of 200%. This makes the spares expensive along with other car parts. On top of this we almost pay 70% (OTR including road tax, gst , cess, etc) in taxes using our post tax salary which was taxed @ 34% to start with. So for the top model Kushaq, Skoda gets only 11.7L. This figure can be further adjusted for import duty paid on 5% imported parts(considering 95% localisation). So effectively you buy a Kushaq with a pretax amount of 31.3L where almost 20L goes to government in taxes and Skoda gets 11.3L. This car will then run on heavily taxed fuel.

In the 17-20 lakh on road price bracket he will be hard pressed to find options that are reliable, more powerful and provide comparable space to his 2011 Honda City.

I feel that Skoda has overpriced this car, which doesn't have 6 airbags in top-end AT (which is a shame for a 21L car) and TPMS and a Diesel engine as well, which Skoda/VW removed from the engine deliberately due to BS6! Even its competitors like Creta and Seltos have those 6 airbags and TPMS at a cheaper price and even the Sonet AT/DCT, which is nearly 5-6L cheaper than the Kushaq, has 6 airbags and TPMS! Another irony is, even Honda is offering 6 airbags from City VX itself, which is a mid variant, and 4 airbags in base variant V! IMO, I feel 1.0 TSI AT is overpriced and instead, will go for Honda City ZX CVT, which has a spacious rear seat and has a proven 1.5 iVTEC engine along with reliable mechanicals and A.S.S, which is way better than Skoda, at that price or will go for its cheaper sibling, the Rapid, which has the same engine but drives well when to compared to its cousin! The advantage which Koreans have over the Kushaq is the Diesel engine (has 6-speed Diesel AT as well, which is the best combo), better rear-seat comfort than the Kushaq, and has better dealership network when compared to Skoda! Barring safety, the Koreans have a better package than the Kushaq! I hope Kia will listen to the feedback given by the customers and improve the structural integrity of the Seltos and offer additional safety features from the base version itself, which will be a better bet and the Kushaq will be facing the heat from the Seltos as well as Creta if they offer those additional safety features from the base version! Now, I feel that the waiting period of the Creta/Seltos/Sonet along with Honda City will get increased, thanks to disastrous pricing by Skoda! The Kushaq is for the enthusiasts, who want performance as well as build quality while the Creta/Seltos is for the people, who want bling, better rear-seat comfort, and the dealership network! I was planning to replace my 2014 City iDTEC with the Kushaq soon, but now, I'll have to look for somewhere else!

While I understand the price overlap between Nexon/Venue/Sonet and Creta/Seltos, the Kushaq should rightly fall in the second bracket, given its price/dimension/engine options. I wonder if people remember the Toyota Yaris launch a few years ago. It was marketed as a car which was a competitor to the City and Verna. However when people actually saw the car and they realised it was smaller, it disappeared off the sales chart despite Toyota being a highly regarded brand. Few could digest buying a smaller car than the City and Verna for a similar price. Perhaps size wasn't the only issue but for us Indians it often is. Is Kushaq really competing with the Seltos or the Sonet? The 4m rule is an arbitrary number enforced by the government and I don't know if anyone can really justify Kushaq's length being more than 4m as the reason for a much higher price. When Skoda decided to design Kushaq for India they made a decision to make it longer than 4m and still make it smaller than the Creta. The Sonet is only smaller in length and is bigger in the remaining dimensions. The Sonet / Venue also offer a 1.0 turbo with even better features and a proven ASS at a lower price. The only difference being the length by a few cms. I doubt Skoda is targetting 8,000 cars a month, it looks like it was purely a marketing gimmick. The announced price removed any thought of them competing with Kia and Hyundai. I am a big VAG fan and love my 5 year old Vento TSI. My DSG has died once and was luckily replaced under warranty and even despite that it is a phenomenal car and I don't regret buying it for an instant. If the Kushaq was sub 4m and priced accordingly with the same engine and gearbox options I would have seriously considered. I think they got greedy, so my search for the Vento TSI's replacement continues.

With all due respect, Sir, I think you are making a grave error by extrapolating the crash performance of the the international Venue to the Indian Sonet and Indian Venue. You should give BHPian RSR's thread a look, if your primary reason for dropping the Seltos was its poor crash performance. Here (Are Indian Hyundais different from developed market Hyundais? If so, how?) is his post which compares the structural differences between the Indian Venue and International Venue. Here (Are Indian Kias different from developed-market Kias? If so, how?) is the superstructure of the Sonet for comparison. Here (Are Indian Kias different from developed-market Kias? If so, how?) is the difference between the Indian and international Seltos. It shows how the removal of the red (UHSS) steel in the pillar and few other regions impacted the crash rating of the Indian Seltos. Granted that crash ratings across NCAPs aren't directly comparable. But if you look at the ODB score for Australian Seltos, it scored 5.54/8, which, when doubled, translates to 11.08/16 (ANCAP halves this score according to their current protocol). If, hypothetically, GNCAP used the same injury assessment criteria for the head and chest region (which I'll outright say is slightly different in reality), but the overall scoring and rating criteria remained the same as the current protocol, the Australian Seltos would score 11.08/16 (ODB) + 1/1 (SBR) = 12.08/17 overall, which would make it eligible for a 4-star rating at GNCAP in this hypothetical scenario. In fact, the Australian Venue, despite getting an overall 4-star rating in ANCAP, scored 7.21/8 in ODB test, which translates to 14.42/16 when doubled to get the actual score for ODB test. It has, in fact, outperformed the Australian Seltos in this particular test. The only reason it got an overall 4-star rating was because it scored 62% in safety assist, which is less than the threshold 70% required for a 5-star rating at ANCAP. In fact, assuming the hypothetical scenario I outlined for Australian Seltos, the Australian Venue would score 14.42 (ODB) + 1/1 (SBR) = 15.42/17 overall at GNCAP (given similar head and chest assessment criteria), which would give it a full 5-star rating. But this applies only to the Australian variants in this hypothetical scenario. The same can't be conclusively said for the Indian variants with missing UHSS reinforcements. I would humbly request you to reconsider your evaluation and extrapolation of international Venue's crash rating to the Indian Sonet, given the missing UHSS reinforcements on the Indian variant, if your reason for dropping the Seltos was its dismal crash rating itself. However, if you do wish to proceed with the Sonet regardless, I would still wish you all the best.", 30th June 2021,skoda-kushaq,Mohali,216,768,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

The Renault Triber, again a car the size of the Swift, can seat 7, is rated 4 Stars in GNCAP and its top end trim can be had for 8L OTR in most parts of the country. 3. The Nissan Magnite, another 4 Stars rated car, offers a 1L turbo petrol and a proper CVT transmission for 10L OTR! ( Well the Kiger too, for that matter). All the cars mentioned above have decent sales performance as well. 4. Most people here actually found the Kushaq's pricing unreasonably high, instead of screaming take my money Skoda! And that might reflect in its sales performance. I know some cars like the Fortuner, Innova and Octavia, are getting unreasonably pricey, but I believe their prices are governed by the same laws of economics that applies to Onions and Potatoes.", 30th June 2021,skoda-kushaq,MH04,181,560,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

This is a nice excel sheet but I have to reiterate this point. The Seltos and Creta both have more features than the MErcedes Benz C class, BMW X1 and BMW 3 series and costs half of them. Yet people looking for a BMW don't look at Creta and Seltos because it checks more boxes on an excel sheet. I was looking at a Seltos last last year as it had all the features I would want. I had driven the Seltos in Goa for the media drive and was impressed. After coming back I went to the dealer and did another TD. Because the Octavia was having discounts, I went and did a TD of it. After that I had no interest to even consider the Seltos. Middle of last year I drove the Creta and the Karoq. Again the Karoq had no reclining seats, no smart connectivity, no front parking sensors, no 360 camera, no fancy audio system with subwoofer, no ventilated seats plus other stuff missing. On top of that it was 32L on road which was 10 lakhs more than the Creta top end 1.4L Turbo. However after driving it, it drove closer to a BMW X1 than the Creta. It was better than the Mercedes GLA to drive. The Creta in comparison felt good but drive quality, feel, dynamics were nowhere close and it left no lasting impression on me. This thread should tell you similar thought process. https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/test-...ip-review.html (Skoda Karoq : Ownership Review) The buyer spent 10L more than a Creta/Seltos for a smaller car with lesser features.

Be it the Superb or Octavia (pre facelift), both put the much more costly German trio, to shame WRT size, features and performance.

I did not include these because- 1) Don't find cornering fog lamps that impactful. If Skoda had put in the dynamic headlamps of the Superb/Octavia's which turn along with steering direction or some permanent cornering lamps inside the headlamps like (Tucson/XUV500 etc.), this would have been a huge positive. Likewise, Seltos has LED foglamps, compared to Kushaq's Halogen, and to some that can be a positive. Personally, I don't think fog lamps being LED/halogen would make much of a difference and hence hasn't been mentioned. 2) Wireless AA was left out, because I have seen it to be quite laggy in some manufacturer's.

Driving it on the highway is an addictive experience and you will find yourself driving fast, even if you didn't intend to. The Kushaq's ride quality can be termed as mature & compliant. We have to say this is the perfect suspension tune that Skoda has chosen. It is neither too soft (Hector) nor too stiff (Seltos). Driving the Kushaq on winding roads was fun, with the front end seemingly eager to turn. Sure, there is some body roll, but it's a family crossover at the end of the day. Nothing too alarming, and we actually had a blast coming down the Lonavala ghats. While its main rivals, the Creta and Seltos, get all-wheel disc brakes, the Kushaq makes do with discs at the front and drums at the rear. The brake pedal is well calibrated and feels sharp to use. In fact, we felt that the brakes of the Kushaq were more confidence-inspiring than that of the Korean twins. The braking is powerful and we felt confident with them on our highway run.

599, Mr.Perera , 22:59 ,BHPian,"Last year I was in the market for a crossover in the 20 lakh price range. Went and test drove the Seltos. The feature list looked bigger than that in an S-class. I even booked the Seltos 1.4 GTX DCT. Thats when Skoda announced the Karoq and we thought to give it a look expecting it to be priced around 20 lakhs. When the car was launched we all felt it was super expensive. Like this thread there is a Karoq thread where most are saying Skoda Karoq is dead on arrival, Skoda just went bonkers with pricing and all. Even I was not convinced about the high sticker price. We thought to go to the showroom and give a look at the Karoq. When parked beside my Ecosport, the Karoq even looked much smaller than the Ford. Just after a short test drive, the decision to buy the Karoq was made. Even though it was a huge stretch of 9 lakhs, the car made us feel like we were inside a 45 lakh car. Its been a year with the Karoq, and do I miss the air purifier ? No. Do I miss the heads up display ? No. Do I feel I overpaid for a car that the whole nation labelled as 'overpriced' ? Hell No ! My suggestion would be not to judge a book by its cover. I would rather wait till I take a test drive, see few ownership reviews and then raise my voice regarding a car. If this car is built well and it drives well than the competition then it definitely will get a place in the sales chart. Best example being the Polo. The i20 and the Baleno do have more features and sell well. But the Polo still being 10 years old, having cramped interiors and much less features is still considered as one of the best cars under 10 lakhs by many. In my books the biggest mistake done by Skoda was to skimp the 6 airbags on the top end model. A person spending 20 lakhs for the top of the line variant is someone who doesn't want to compromise on anything.

Was surprised to find out by a massive margin! Just check the below snaps. Comparison is good, and here's my thought on the same. There's no way pre-tensioners are left out of a car like Kushaq. May be they felt it is insignificant to highlight it as a feature. Rear camera with static guidelines is just pathetic. I mean they have cornering function, which means car already has all the sensors required already. Then why skip it out for rear camera? For me, guidelines have been very useful while parking. DRVM, again might be not important enough to highlight it out. It is just feeding rear view camera while on the move. But worth verifying it out. As long as sound system is good 7 or 8 speakers won't make much difference. Front parking sensor would have been a really nice addition. Even Creta doesn't get it. MT version gets TPMS and 6 Airbags. It is not required for AT because this group generally have super-human ability to sense tire pressures and usually have extra airbags lying around to put it on their cars (/s). I'm assuming this is the case, because none of the companies actually release AT version with proper features of an MT version ( Hyundai's SX+ category). Now koda is also doing the same. Width can be a deal breaker for some. It is smaller than Venue by 1cm, and seems to me space is not utilized properly. Engine also can be a deal breaker ( 3-pot Turbo vs 4-pot MPI). I prefer Turbo, but one might not want to. (There has been a good amount of discussion regarding this on the forum anyway). Boot space seems to be whopping 50l less, but usable space might be same. This should be verified. Reclining seats for passengers is sort of expected in this segment? Even S-cross has it. MID is okay. It is nothing fancy, but gets the job done. If I must get Kushaq, I'd prefer the lower variant (Active-MT/Ambition-AT), and add other stuff as accessories. I'm neither enthusiast nor expert, and I feel Kushaq is not a good package. May be I was expecting something like Octavia of this segment? Overpriced, but still plenty of features?

Your post makes me feel better as it was a difficult decision for me to go with Creta diesel AT instead of Kushaq 1.5 dsg. I was eagerly waiting for kushaq launch for a long time. As a family man with grown up boys, overall space at rear was the deal breaker for me. Also, reliability of dsg/ dct, missing basic features for top end automatic (wonder why Skoda skipped on adaptive rear camera, TPMS, underbody protection etc in top end for cost control) and overall inferior interior quality of kushaq (definitely inferior by Skoda standards) played in favour of creta diesel AT. Though my running is less and loved driving creta dct, decided to go for diesel AT for reliability.

Nothing contradictory there. Maybe I wasn't clear in my explanation of why I am disappointed with Kushaq. Will try to rephrase it- I am sure going by the Tbhp review, Kushaq should offer a better driving feel and probably the external build quality. But the issue is Skoda have cut corners in terms of equipment, size (especially interior width), interior quality, and some blasphemous decisions like top end AT getting only 2 airbags. Was this the case with the Octavia (prefacelift) and the Superb? A resounding NO! They too offered segment topping driving feel and the external build quality. But they not only offered segment topping equipment, space,size and interior quality, but infact, they threatened the much more costly German Big Three on almost all counts, including performance. This is where the Kushaq is lacking big time. It might be superior to it's segment's competition in driving feel (Not sure how big the difference is) and build quality, but that's not the only thing I will be looking after spending 20 Big one's.

I haven't driven the Kushaq but based on my extended test drives of the Seltos 1.4 DCT, I found it very enjoyable to drive. The engine is punchy and refined and the DCT gearbox is smooth and fast shifting as well, though marginally slower than the VW DSG. Also, it handles really well for a high riding SUV. So, I don't think Kushaq will score a lot of points over the Seltos in terms of performance or handling. I repeat the only USP of the Kushaq could be the safety aspect but Skoda has shot themselves in the foot by not offering 6 airbags in the top variant. Also, people who are giving Skoda brownie points for build and safety need to keep in mind that this car is built on a tailor made India specific platform, which was built to keep costs in check. So, unless there is NCAP crash test done on this car, we can only guess because we don't know what compromises have been made by Skoda/VW. The international Seltos has received 5* safety rating in other developed countries but it is clear that Kia has compromised on safety for the India specific car. And we have seen such examples in the past from Maruti, Hyundai and other manufacturers. So, it might very well be the case that Skoda too has cut corners and compromised on the safety of this India specific model. And if Skoda is so certain about their safety standards, what stops Zac Hollis and team to proactively get a crash test done and even use it to advertise the USP of the car? I guess Tata followed a similar approach for the Nexon as they were confident about the car's crash test safety.

Firstly, the costs have to be considerably reduced. The reason this platform has proved costly for the Indian market is because it is packaged for expensive tech, like hybrids, full-electric drivetrains, four-wheel-drive and materials that meet the best European standards. Skoda’s engineers hope to ‘de-content’ the MQB by removing some of these systems which will reduce cost and weight. It is also likely that the high-tensile steel body panels which are hot stamped will be replaced with cold-stamped lower-grade steel, which according to a source “will still exceed the standards in the Indian market.” Regarding sales targets, quoting: ""Economies of scale will be also key for the MQB’s feasibility, and though Skoda is tight-lipped about volume projections, suppliers have been asked to gear up for a production run of 4,00,000 to 5,00,000 units a year. Clearly, the Indian market cannot support such volumes, especially since both VW and Skoda have stated that they won't enter the budget end of the market. Hence, Skoda will rely on exports to meet these volume requirements and even sees an opportunity to enter new markets with the Indian product range. First of all, we need a stable footprint in India itself, but in the future, we want to produce cars not just for the local market but also to export to other markets as well. Our footprint internationally is in 102 markets so far, and we are planning to be in 120 markets by the end of 2025.

625, 84.monsoon , 12:29 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Having seen the pricing of the Kushaq, the likelihood that it would garner volumes of anywhere over 2000 units a month is really low. The VW Group really needs a volume seller to reach the goals of 5% market share at least by 2025 (roughly 240,000 cars a year or 20,000 cars a month). The group have already declared that they will not be competing at the lowest end of the market in compact hatchbacks, compact sedans and other sub-4m vehicles. So, the main vehicles that will bring them the volume will be Taigun/Kushaq - the two mid-sized SUVs and the upcoming midsized sedans based on the same platform. So other than the Taigun, they have few other cards left in their hand to play to reach anywhere near these kind of volumes. So, I do expect that there is a strong possibility of the Taigun being priced aggressively and below the Kushaq, including an inaugural launch price for base variant starting below 10 lakhs. The Kushaq Active variant is much better equipped than the base variants of Creta/Seltos, A Taigun Trendline variant could be launched, stripping off the following things from the Kushaq Active and it will still be completely comparable to the Creta base E model, which is priced at 9.99 lakhs (and it will be more powerful and torquey and fun to drive compared to the Creta as well). 6.5 inch touchscreen Infotainment with 6 speakers (Substituted by a simple 2 DIN system) ESC, Multi-collision braking, Electronic Differential Lock System, XDS & XDS+ Anti-slip Regulation & Motor Slip regulation Brake Disc Wiping Roll-over protection Rough road package Roof rails Substitute the new 2 spoke steering wheel which has chrome scrollers etc., with the traditional VW steering wheel from the older parts bin Height adjustable head restraints at rear ISOFIX Such a move could ensure that the base variant is also profitable, which is important to sustain good supply and take long term market share. The group absolutely needs to have a volume play in India, and this is probably their only chance to position themselves to reach the kind of volumes that they are aspiring for. If both these SUVs end up overpriced and bringing in low volumes, the company will be stuck in the same rut that they have been in the last 10 years - with great products, but not enough volumes to justify long-term growth and survival. India may well turn out to be one of the last bastions of internal combustion engines and offers an interesting diversification opportunity for the global auto majors like VW, as the developed world quickly electrifies and new competitors like Tesla emerge. Given the growing population and aspirations in India from now till around 2035 and the low possibility of rapid adoption of electric cars due to constrained infrastructure, the group could keep selling good volumes of IC cars here for the next 15 years. This will help diversify their revenue base, instead of solely relying on electric cars, which will be a much more competitive arena, where differentiation will be harder and risks higher.", 1st July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Chennai,"2,220","9,796",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Take the same price difference / segment difference to an X1 and you would get the far more superior (in every aspect) M3, push it up a bit more and you get the no competition (to the X1 or GLA) X5. Add 20-30 L to these and you get even more superior cars and on and on it goes. Tl;DR - Kushaq to Creta / Seltos is an Apples to Apples comparison. Creta / Seltos to an X1 or GLA is an Lemons to Strawberries comparison. On an apples to apples the Kushaq imho fails the sniff test.

Thanks to airbags, came out without a scratch. So, both creta and kushaq hasn't been tested by any agency, but people prejudge that creta's built Is inferior, why? Kushaq being a brand new product from scratch, you can't give the safety trophy to it yet. Especially after Honda, how foreign brands treat India. 2. Regarding driving dynamics- Even a enthusiastic driver is not going to corner at 100kmph daily, these are passenger cars. Reviewers feel that kushaq is planted and stable, I can say that creta has good road manners, when you are inside, it's comfortable and feels safe. 3. For the same money, siting in the rear seat, you can enjoy the rain drops falling on the panoramic sun roof or feel the city lights lighting up the cabin from above, Like how driving dynamics has to be felt, a panoramic sunroof has to be felt as well. 4. Service reach - 1000+ Hyundai service network vs 65 Skoda service Centres. Imagine taking your beloved Turbo petrol DCT to Himalayas and something unexpected happens? Skoda and VW needs to expand aggressively if they want to sell 10-15 Lac rupees product. From the reviews, kushaq seems like a good product, but lacks in many front against the competition. You can't cover up the lack of features by saying that it's safe and solid just by reputation and without even tested by reputed agencies. I like both the cars, but in regards to safety, they are both equal until tested by reputed agencies. From my crash testing, I can say that creta is safe and will definitely save life at speeds below 60kmph. We mostly tend to trust a brand blindly, Skoda is selling kushaq at a premium only because of its reputation not for the product. Only time will tell its worthiness. You actually summed up all the points in a precise fashion and I really thank you for that. As a Creta owner, I have done a cross country trip and never during the trip, I felt it underpowered or showing any signs of failure. In fact, I was surprised by the way the steering gains weight as you gain speed and I never felt nervous. Just like every vehicle, Creta has its own issues and it's not fair to compare it with other vehicles. And rightly said not everyone drives at 100 km/h and corners at triple-digit. That bunch is minuscule in proportion. With vehicles, it's the overall product that is gauged by the customers and not only a particular aspect. Doing a comparison is one thing and ridiculing one product against other is different. Kushaq I am sure has its own merits but it has to prove it yet as against Creta which is setting the charts on fire.", 1st July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Bengaluru,580,"1,591",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

You see over the years people have got used to parking the vehicle overnight, turning the key the next morning and be on their way, perhaps pop into the fuel bunk once in a few weeks - super convenient. EVs are quite some way far from being a car, forget about drag race. 38% is the installed capacity of renewables - stuff that is sitting idle, when thermal power plants themselves are running under utilized by a lot (economics - or the lack of it) , why would they increase renewables?

Sadly these days we don't get everything we want. Quote: I definitely would feel safer in the car with more airbags in this scenario. But here's the thing, more airbags doesn't always mean more safety. Few important points that make up the safety of any car are: Crumple zones Anti-roll bars Passenger safely cage/zone Structural safety members used (type of steel etc.) Passengers & drivers wearing seat belts, Etc. Both the Kushaq and the Creta do have these important structural elements. Now how they translate into crash test results is anyone's guess. To be fair to the Kushaq, right from the base model it getsESC, ABS, EBD Multi Collision Breaking Electronic Differential Lock system Break disc wiping Roll over protection I am in no way saying the Kushaq is safer than the Creta because of the presumed better build quality. I feel there is a POSSIBILITY that a Kushaq with 2 airbags, could end up getting a better GNCAP score than a Creta/Seltos. Still the wise & best way is to wait for the test results. Remember the humble Tiago? It cost's a fraction of the Seltos, but it has a four star GNCAP score.

This will probably help many of the fellow commentators. But wow, the pure activity is mind boggling on the thread Couple of points after watching the comparison video: 1) Boot space: I remember Zac emphasizing about ""usable"" 385L and he wasn't exaggerating. I have to admit, Kushaq definitely wins here. Great space mangamenet 2) Stance: In the video, at 9:47, both cars are standing next to each other. Not sure if its the camera angles, but Kushaq doesn't seem as small as it appeared from all the comments. It looks good actually, especially the rear styling. But again, looks are subjective 3) Feature list: It was nice that the host specifically showcased all the ""common"" features. Till now, reading all the posts on the forum, it felt like Kushaq was way behind Creta. But honestly, Kushaq has got a good list, and a very usable one at that (I personally am not a fan of sunroofs) 4) Ride handling & comfort: Looks like CarDekho is calling it for Kushaq. Can't wait to do a TD myself 5) Traction Modes: Honestly, I find them gimmicky (personal opinion). Even when I ask my friends who have these traction modes, how much do you use them, its not even 5% of the time. Atleast for urban dwellers, where do you use it? I think Kushaq can go anywhere a Creta can. The difference comes at FWD vs RWD (to some extenet) vs AWD (major difference). As someone who will be in the market for a new car next year, in this segment, I am waiting for Kushaq (and Taigun) to hit the road & watch it perform over the next few months. Should we expect an improvement in the incumbent Style variant, or a new Style+ later... I hope so! Will it lead to a higher price ---> sure!

654, varun_ro , 21:42 ,BHPian,"Being the last day of my vacation at my hometown today, me and my parents decided to go take test drives of a few cars. Things we were looking for: 1. A good petrol engined CSUV 2. Must have Android auto. 3. Comfortable seating for 5.10 feet drivers. 4. Rear legroom that doesn't make us miss our Captiva. 5. Rear A/C vents. 6. Electronically foldable OVRMs. The car mainly would be used by my parents with my sister taking the backseat sometimes. And my dad drives every weekend to our native place in Vapi from Mumbai. We started with taking a test drive of the XL6 and Harrier. Both were too big and honestly, for a family for 3, as I don't stay in mumbai, our Captiva was always too huge. We had previously taken test drives of the seltos and the Creta and having owned other Korean cars before, we were not a fan the quality and handling of Hyundai cars. So next was taking a test drive of the Kushaq. We went to JMD skoda at Andheri and they had a 1.0 TSi AT for test drive. Me and my dad drove the car and loved the ride quality and the handling. The 1.0 TSI is an explosive engine. The interiors are top notch, and so is the quality of the paint job and fit and finish. The suspension is much much better than the Koreans. Having had a hassle free experience of owning a Skoda Octavia Rider for a decade, and ignoring all the comments on this thread that I've been reading in the last few days, we went heart over head and booked the Kushaq in Ambience trim, in Red color! My dad mostly has a sedate driving style. And having survived a crash in a car with two airbags, we decided we would let go the extra airbags. Now looking forward for the delivery month.

The Octavia might trump the Elantra, but that's not the case in this segment, the Creta invented it and now you've got the Seltos, combined they sell 4 times what skoda plans to in a few years from now. The Koreans have 3 engines and 5 transmission on offer they're not on a back foot, I guess they'll double down and increase prices. We are supposed to be in awe of the safety, build quality, handling and ambience. Safety is untested as of now, less airbags equal more safety because of sheet metal thickness, right. Build quality, a completely arbitrary opinion, the Creta and the Seltos don't feel like tin cans at all, they're the direct competition. Handling is pretty much at par for the Creta and Seltos, at legal speeds nobody is going to give it a second thought. The Kushaq has dreary interiors, look at the drab color combination and poor finish of the steering wheel, yes it's going to hold up really well. The Creta and Seltos have good interiors and the Creta panoramic sunroof is awesome, a proper luxury feature. You can go against the tide and pick up what the market has dropped, be prepared for a long ownership period, dicey service and disastrous depreciation.

It definitely has got more depth in boot to accommodate more odd items and carry bags This is what I have been saying all along regarding the boot space and this reaffirms the actual measurements I had taken of the Creta.. It has a very Shallow boot space and it cannot accommodate luggage (even in this video, it taken in much less luggage than the Kushaq). Good that they demonstrated with actual luggage and people can now see the real difference. Even though I have cancelled my Kushaq booking, I am still planning to see and test drive the car once it is available in the Gurgaon showroom after 6th July (when the cars reach them). I will share my observations on the car once I see and drive the car. Though I have booked the Sonet GTX+ Diesel AT Dual Tone (at an on road price of almost 16 Lacs), I will still consider the Kushaq Ambition 1.0 TSI AT, which is also close to 16 Lacs on road. Delivery of my Sonet is still at least 18-19 weeks, so waiting and watching for any better options I can get in the Interim. I would have gone ahead with my initial Kushaq Style 1.0 TSI AT booking (on road close to 18) If and only if they would have retained the 6 airbags also in the Auto version. Hopefully they will get some sense and relaunch a better version (hopefully Monte Carlo with 6 airbags and also Digital Driver display) soon. The Challenge however remains that I drive close to 105 kms every day and with a Diesel Auto Sonet I would get around 15-16 Kmpl mileage and spend around 600 Rupees per day on Fuel alone. While with a Petrol Auto 1.0, I would end up spending almost double of that.

People will choose any of the cars based on their personal preferences, and to me the offerings from the brands in the respective segment are aggressively matched based on their selling benchmarks. Koreans wants to sell on bigger car, more gimmikcy features, Skoda wants to sell on a well balanced package of ride handling and usable features. As far as my suggestion goes to any car buyer in any segment, my advice is simple check the cars in person don’t go by words of mouth just visit the showrooms spend a bit time with the product, analyse compare and make the decision, because at the end of the day you are the one going to spend most time with your buy. In my case i ended up buying Polo even if i wanted a Rapid, because i listened to too many advices you don’t need a bigger car you should save money, smaller car means easy to drive easy park etc etc, but what happened at the end is i used to just pin point Rapid whenever i see one when i was driving my Polo (which very much liked).

On a lighter note, what if one of Skoda's competitor vehicles without all that gizmodry comes and rams into someone's kushaq (because those cars skid easy, can't brake properly, aren't European safe, etc). Surely the 6 airbags will be relevant then for the Kushaq occupants isn't it? Honestly, give it all 6 airbags and if I was hypothetically looking at Creta vs Kushaq, my sense is I'd pick the 1.5 DSG Style and take my chances with the gearbox. Even at current pricing.

The Koreans have 3 engines and 5 transmission on offer they're not on a back foot, I guess they'll double down and increase prices. We are supposed to be in awe of the safety, build quality, handling and ambience. Safety is untested as of now, less airbags equal more safety because of sheet metal thickness, right. Build quality, a completely arbitrary opinion, the Creta and the Seltos don't feel like tin cans at all, they're the direct competition. Handling is pretty much at par for the Creta and Seltos, at legal speeds nobody is going to give it a second thought. The Kushaq has dreary interiors, look at the drab color combination and poor finish of the steering wheel, yes it's going to hold up really well. The Creta and Seltos have good interiors and the Creta panoramic sunroof is awesome, a proper luxury feature.

No diesel, overpriced automatics with less airbags and skoda service, looks like a clear winner. The Korean twins stretch between 10-20 otr, the Kushaq hasn't been tested for safety yet and its based on a cut price localisation platform with a focus on cost cutting. What key parameters did the Kushaq trump the koreans on? Why would anyone choose a stressed 1 litre 3 cylinder turbo over an equally powerful 1.5 NA the koreans offer, for dreadful economy? Finally someone said it. That’s one lovely post! I know how defensive one gets when your choice is questioned. But to all the future owners, do not go by the reviews alone, drive the vehicle for yourself. A car doesn’t become safe just because it is advertised so. Brand alone doesn’t not guarantee your family’s safety. Not sure about the Seltos but Creta is a proven product, tin can or not, it works for lacs of users, and wonderfully at that. And Skoda projects itself as a premium brand and hence the pricing. To be honest, it’s good to compare specs between cars to the dot, but in the end, go for the one which makes you smile and to which your heart calls for.

677, SBM3J , 13:18 ,BHPian,"I stopped by at a Skoda showroom on my way to somewhere else. They had 3 cars(2 display and 1 for test drive) all of them 1L manual style variant. Couldn’t test drive as there were 3 people waiting for test drive and didn’t have the time to wait. Here is my observations on the most talked about points. External looks: looks excellent, in my opinion the best looking car in the class. Looks shorter than Creta when standing next to it, but other than that it looks as big as creta. Interior quality: good enough, I felt it’s on par with creta but, doesn’t feel particularly impressive on anything. I don’t know how to put it but let’s just say it feels like a skoda made for India and made in India. Reviews about the roof liner is correct, it feels cheap. The biggest let down is the ac vents, Skoda needs to do a better quality control and fire the vendor responsible for the vents but this is no way a dealbreaker. Interior space: front seats are very comfortable. Back seats are a disappointment. I am ok with it being narrower, also it has excellent knee room. Where it feels so bad is it’s not a comfortable place to be. I am not a person who is very tall, but I felt claustrophobic sitting in the back seat. I think it has to do with the way the seats are placed in relation with the front seats and also the lower roof is making it bad. I don’t remember feeling this way sitting in any other car’s backseat. Boot space: it looked good enough for me and I think it’s more or less same as Creta. Overall I felt it’s a good package. The decision to give only 2 airbags for automatic is going to come back and bite skoda in the long run. I remember someone else also talking about feeling claustrophobic in the back seats.

Paint quality is exceptional. The showroom had 3 colours Silver,white and orange The car looked stunning in silver. Halogen fog bulb looks odd for such beautiful car. No other complaints exterior wise. Some observations at the interior. Dashboard layout is clean not too busy. 1.As soon as you step inside you are greeted by the cheap/ too squishy seat cushioning. (How did Skoda get this wrong?!) Other customer at the showroom felt that too.( Style varient) 2.A/c vents felt flimsy too. Fit and finish By no way Skoda standard. 3.Camera resolution is the worst would rank it below Mg hector. 4.Sunroof is small and has exposed mechanism. Looks like it's Given just for the sake of competition. 5. The frontal roof dangles from inside when you press it. (Check it out for yourself) But you do feel protected inside the cabin though. 6. Steering feels good to hold onto. Coming at the back seat knee room is adequate for 6 ft adults. but width wise strictly for two adults. The middle seat somehow protrudes much outside the other seats and will make side passenger uncomfortable also the middle seat felt like sitting on a wood ( it is hard, not exaggerating). And your head will touch the roof if you opt for sunroof varient. (I am 6'1) To sum it up if you are in market for an compact suv with budget max 16L go ahead with this car. Anything above 17L for a car with this level fit&finish, back seat space and features & engine option is just not justified. Apart from that the SA at aurangabad had 0 knowledge of the car.

694, rahulcmoulee , 21:20 ,BHPian,"Checked out the car today. The dealer had 2 cars, both Style variant. One was Orange and the other was Silver. The car looks good from the outside. Paint quality is really good and panel gaps are consistent throughout. It does look a bit disproportionate from the side as it feels like the boot ends abruptly. Doors close with a solid thud. Once inside, the dashboard design looks good and the steering wheel feels nice to hold. As pointed out by others, the roofliner around the sunroof area is of poor quality and even the sunroof mechanism is exposed. AC vents (especially the side ones) feel very flimsy. Plastic quality is on par with the Koreans and is par for the course for this segment. The Rear Seat is what really kills this car. Legroom is very good, but that's where the positives end. It is a strict 4 seater and it is nearly impossible to sit comfortably 3 abreast. I would say it was comparable to our current Ecosport which is already very tight in the rear. The next problem is by scooping out the roof to increase headroom, the non-scooped out part of the roof comes in the eyeline of tall people. I am 6' 2"" and while I had enough headroom and legroom, I felt cooped in because of the roof line. Middle seat is very hard and raised as well, so headroom will definitely be an issue. The boot was bigger than expected. It is nice and deep and well shaped. Only the loading lip is a bit too high. This is definitely not a proper premium Skoda offering. The new octavia which was also present in the showroom was much much more premium feeling. I'd say this is on par if not slightly worse than a Rapid when it comes to interior fit and finish.

At the onset just let me say, it is a foolish decision to skimp on 6 airbags especially if the manual top variant gets it, looks to be purely dictated by the bean counter guys. Coming to the main point, its very much possible to score a 4/5 star in GNCAP with just 2-airbags. Many have done it in the past, wouldn't be surprised if Kushaq achieves it. The point to be noted is that GNCAP is actually one of the least severe of the NCAP tests done and performs the side impact only with a Mobile-Deformable-Barrier (MDB) and skips on the much sever pole impact test. In theory it is impossible for any vehicle with just 2 airbags to safely pass the side pole test.", 2nd July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Amchi,226,923,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Are you saying that Skoda, VW or any other Euro brand shouldn't bother with mass market cars since most buyers go for features as per check list and Skoda/VW will lose out? We all know that the Europeans cannot cut cost like the Japanese and Koreans. It has been the case with Polo, Rapid, Vento. Skoda already has a small SUV that is a proper European, the Karoq. As CBU it was priced at 25L ex showroom. Even if they did a CKD it would be at max 22-23L ex showroom. The result would be the same 200-300 cars per month for a few months then down to double digits. The only way to bring the costs down to the Korean and japanese levels to cut wherever possible without diluting too much. Every brand has been doing this including Ford. Yes, the Skoda is expensive and it was always going to be but the fact that it is now an option for a Hyundai/Kia buyer since the price point is same is what matters. The thread clearly shows that Kia/Hyundai potential buyers and owners are all interested in Kushaq now Skoda/VW packaging has never been great in mass market cars other than the Superb. The Polo is the most cramped, the Karoq was tight at the back, the Yeti was like a hatchback, the Laura was cramped vs the Corolla and Civic. The Kushaq has the legroom which in itself is a feat but you can't win em all and the width is suited only for 2. If you need space, Tata and MG should be your pick not Skoda or even Kia/Hyundai. Everyone has different approaches in this segment. Tata, MG will give you maximum car for your buck. Hyundai/Kia will give you maximum features for your buck. Skoda is badge value plus drive quality plus solid feel as well as safety (GTO mentioned 4 star safety is pretty much assured as per his reliable birdie). So you need to take your pick. Pricing wise I definitely agree it's a premium and 2L cheaper would have been ideal but its something you have to accept with Euro brands. The Jeep Compass was same story when it launched. People cross shopping between Kia/Hyundai would crib as to how expensive the compass was with lesser space and lesser features and those who appreciated the attributes would not even look at the Koreans. No matter how much localisation, how many variants they tried, features juggling as well but they just couldn't compete on price with Kia/Hyundai. The only gross miss by Skoda remains that at this price point a Skoda buyer expects that the top AT variant will have all the features and not lose 6 airbags as you go up in variant.

However, as I understand, the customs duty on the Karoq was absorbed by Skoda and not passed on to the customer. Skoda was making a loss on every Karoq sold in India. Going by that, the CKD imports of Karoq would be priced higher than 25 Lacs to have a sustainable sales volume. Probably, Skoda should have tried to localize the Kamiq production in an as-is condition without trying to develop an all-new car for India.

713, shibujp , 15:39 ,Senior - BHPian,"Ironically I am typically critical of Skoda's pricing. However given the experience of the Octavia I was pleasantly surprised to see the pricing start at 10.49 lakhs having expected a 13-18 lakh range. However looking at the features and variants it is evident that the prices are certainly at a premium. But it's hardly a surprise. For a brand that touts Äffordable luxury"" as it's tag line you can hardly expect it to be priced anything other than premium. I for one, do not think Skoda is competing with the Koreans or the Japanese, for the simple reason that they cannot. They are too far into their game to be effective at that. The Kushaq is simply a Polo in the SUV segment. Having been a Polo owner and now that of a Baleno I understand both worlds. Think about why Swifts and Balenos sell in numbers and you will also get where the Kushaq numbers will stack up. And it has nothing to do with the personal characteristics of buyers or their lack of knowledge. The Kushaq would play a similar strategy. For the small family or single person wishing to buy into a European experience and the benefits/compromises that come with it, it's a valid choice. However for a typically Asian family space and bang for buck matters so the Koreans still rule the roost. And dynamically the gap is not what it once was. I would for once stop to hail the Kushaq as an excellent choice simply because of the iffy nature of Skoda service. In the Indian context where we have absymally low service qualities in almost every figment of life, having to deal with it in a car ownership is hardly alluring. We Indians for the most part are a very pragmatic bunch of people. Unless Skoda and the VAG group bring a monumental shift in their service culture they are never going to effectively play the volume game. When you have a lot other pressing issues in middle class Indian life a reluctant service organization is way more vexing than a creaking panel. That's a reality. Where the Kushaq starts to look a bargain is when you put it against the Jeep Compass. You get a wonderful set of petrol power plants, excellent legroom and competent dynamics all at a very competitive price compared to the Compass. And a service availability that certainly trumps that of Jeep/Fiat. That said I can hardly wait to see the car in the showrooms for myself. Both the Kushaq and the Octavia are on my bucket list.

714, NevGin , 15:57 ,BHPian,My showroom visit was good. The burnt orange looks glorious. Nothing changed for me after I saw it in person. May be a tad smaller but this is going to be a new dimension of cars on roads soon. That additional width which is missing is anyway still not too comfortable to fit a 3rd adult. This backseat seals the deal. No third adult at all. Its best that way. Fit & finish externally is really top class. The seat bolstering is weird as everyone said but I think it being a tad softer and more compliant maybe because of earlier feedback not sure. Highlight of my trip to the showroom was the gentleman who was attending to us. Told me that there was more booking for the 1.5 and that if I booked today I would get delivery in November. Of course I was there just to look at it. Did not want the drive either until they get the 1.5.

715, ridehard , 17:47 ,BHPian,"Had dropped into the showroom, to do a test drive. Unfortunately, the TD card are only going to be ready from Monday. So, just checked out the car in red and orange. Red looks super! The exteriors are fantastic, better finish than any competitor. Front row interiors look quite good, at least aesthetically. Didn't check the quality of the bits, but felt like a nice, sophisticated place to be. The rear seats were not so welcoming, but it was okay. The roof felt, too close to my head (6ft guy), despite being scooped out. No wonder why some felt claustrophobic. The width as reported everywhere, is quite limited. So much, that accomodating a kid with two ~75kg adults might be a tough ask. For 2 average height persons, the rear should be a good enough space to be. Quick City Test Drive comparison: Since I also have the Rapid in my list, asked for a TD of the same. Unfortunately, someone had taken it for a long TD. Disappointed, I went to check out the City 5G, next door. TD was free, had a good time with it. The interiors were nice, not modern like the Skoda, but it felt sort of rich. And all that beige, makes the cabin feel so spacious and airy. The seats were so comfy, and enough width to seat 3 fairly built adults.

716, ashvek3141 , 18:07 ,BHPian,"So I had a look at the Skoda Kushaq 1.0 MT Style variant. Below are my impressions of seeing & driving the 1L MT variant. These are all personal observations and in no way meant to offend any car / brand in particular. Also, these observations will largely be based on the comparison to my humble 1st-gen Creta SX+ VTVT MT & the 'newer' Korean's. Disclaimer: I am NOT a Hyundai fan-boy although I own one. I didn't click any pictures as there are plenty of them on the net already! Interior & Exterior: - There were two cars: the Honey Orange colour on display and the White for TD's. Both in top spec Style variant. - As expected NO 1.5L models. However, the 1.0L AT is expected to be available for TD's in the coming week. - First up, the car is definitely a size smaller than the Koreans; no two ways about it. This is more or less comparable to the S-cross albeit slightly heighted. It simply get's lot into the crowd. You won't give it a second look for sure. - The exterior design is typical 'skoda', and the rear is more in-line with the elder Skoda SUV's. - I did observe a slight 'orange peel' effect in the Honey orange shade which was parked inside the showroom and under heavy lighting. In general the paint quality is decent. - Like I mentioned, due to the dimensions the car doesn't give you that SUV vibe which maybe the Creta / Seltos manages to give. I am not saying the Koreans are typical SUV's, but they atleast give the kinda look IMHO. The Kushaq doesn't quite do that. Also, being shorter in height doesn't help either. Heck, even the Sonet / Brezza looks a bit butch from front especially. - On the inside too the car doesn't feel roomier as compared to the Koreans. Surely it isn't claustrophobic, but NOT roomy a such. - I just had about 7 - 8 cms of headroom with drivers seat set to my height (I am 6 ft. tall). It is even worse at the rear. The sloping roofline comes very close to the head. - Overall the from seat comfort is good. Good back support and one can easily find a comfortable driving position. - The seating of the car is low too. With the Kushaq's seat set to the lowest setting, it gives you the feel of a hatch / sedan seating. The difference was very apparent when I switched back to my Creta. The driving position in my 1st-gen is surely commanding in comparison to the Kushaq. - The quality of leather on the steering is surely disappointing. Not at all expected from Skoda. It also look a bit thin to hold. Skoda's got to improve this ASAP. - The seat leather was kinda acceptable though. I didn't find any of the creases that were seen in the reviews, or I wasn't looking closely maybe. - It's got a 'meak' horn. Skoda could have atleast given it the wind tone horn. How much would that increase the cost anyway? - The AC controls are nice to operate. One will get used to them very easily. - The touchscreen is fluid and easy to use, reminiscent to today's times. Good display quality too. - The infamous roof liner: Well, it surely could have been better is what I would say. I didn't find it to be flexing as shown in the review of evo India; but ya, there's scope for improvement. - The plastics on the door, especially on the upper half near the windows are too hard and scratchy. I wonder how long they'll last. Skoda should have given a better quality materials at these touchpoints atleast. - The windows!! Ahh, they're terribly noisy in operation. Damn, even my 2nd-gen Swift windows don't make so much noise during operation. Skoda, really?? Also, no famed one-touch-up / down for the passenger windows, sad. - The rear space is good except for the headroom as I mentioned earlier. the legroom is decent and me being 6ft tall had no issues seating behind my driving position. But, it's strictly a 2 seater for 2 healthy adults at the back. I found the recline angle of the rear seat little upright though. - The boot is adequately spacious. The is surely better than my Creta's boot and will swallow more luggage. Driving Impressions: - The clutch is slightly on the heavier side for a petrol car; is what I felt. I found the travel a bit long too. - The car pulls just like a good NA engine from standstill. It starts picking speeds once past the 1800 rpm mark. I didn't find any push-in-seat feel though. Having said that, the engine isn't a slouch & does a good job. - On slopes too, the Kushaq struggled terribly in 2nd gear to pick up pace. - I feel the AT will be a better option for the 1L instead of the manual. I am waiting to drive the AT though. - Somehow the performance of the motor didn't 'wow' me. I feel that the 1.5L will be a killer package!! And this is said in our TBHP review too. - Shifting of the gears was a bit notchy, which could have been better. Not a dealer breaker though. - The handling is typical Skoda and the car holds the line on curves without any drama. - Braking too is great! - I found the ride to be a little bumpy for a Skoda. However, I feel that the tyres were surely over inflated as the cars had arrived just yesterday and none of the showroom guys would have bothered to check the pressure. The SA tried searching for the TPMS in the MID, however, he wasn't able to locate it. I didn't try either. - I loved the music system. Nice punchy bass it's got! Waiting to drive the 1L AT, which I feel would surely be better than the MT in terms of drivability. Overall, this car didn't 'wow' me per se. Surely it is a good package, but could have been priced aggressively IMHO. Would I pick this if I was in the market for a PETROL CSUV?

718, maverickNerd , 18:20 ,BHPian,"Hey everyone, finally after lot of tries, I got my membership approved and I am so happy about it. Yay !! On to the main point now, I am waiting from a long time for a vehicle. Last year before covid, I booked Seltos HTK+, and got a call from dealer just before lockdown but since my office already started WFH, me and my better half knew lockdown is coming. So I said NO to the car, then during diwali time again booked Seltos, this time HTX model as I saved some more money but then the crash rating came and like everyone else, I was not able to comfort myself with the thought and cancelled again, since that time I was waiting for Skoda SUV/crossover. My first preference is always safety and though I am not impressed with Kushaq launch and prices, but I still think all important features are available in Kushaq and a big list of active safety feature that no one provides in this segment like brake wiping, XDS, and others. I went to showroom few days back to check Kushaq and then went to Hyundai and Kia showroom right after that, here is my and my wife's view on it: 1. Kushaq doors, bonnet, and tailgate is much much heavier than both creta and kia. 2. Kushaq does not look small at all, infact from side, it looks bigger because large wheelbase. 3. Kushaq does have less height, and wife was not impressed with it, she found Seltos height as better and hence felt it more spacious, she even felt little claustrophobic because of seat colors and less height, She liked Seltos light color scheme in seats. Though for our heights(5ft 8') I didn't find the height to have any problem and I know less height will help in overall dynamics. 4. Found Ac vents clips of cheaper quality in Kushaq, middle ones are good but side ones are not. 5. Found that roofliner is not as bad as was presented in reviews. Infact I am able to press seltos and creta roofliner also with same pressure. Can easily live with it. 6. Boot space seems small on paper for kushaq but we both think it can absorb more stuff as it is deep. Though quality of boot lid cover is bad in kushaq. But we hardly touch it except when we need spare wheel and can be changed if needed. 7. Two spoke steering wheel is very premium compared to seltos and creta. 8. Middle armrest was useless in both creta and Seltos, it is very useful in kushaq because it is sliding. 9. Now, the most important point, rear width, so as per my measurement, we found hardly any difference in rear width, and wife, me and a healthy salesman sit together shoulder to shoulder(we are not fat, but not thin also). I sat in the middle, and I feel as part of highly adjustable Indian society, my family of 5 can sit there once they come and visit me(once/twice a year). Infact, rear seats of kushaq for 2 are very comfortable because kushaq has bucket seats. For 2 people on back, it feels premium and very relaxed. Seltos and creta rear seats are not having such good bucket seats. In Kushaq, for 3 people it is ok, one can sit easily if you are not so fat/bulky, but since there is a cup-holder on back, it is not soft, and this problem is with all the cars which has cup holders in rear seats. Overall we both found the vehicle more premium than Creta and Seltos and we found build quality same as Ecosport which we checked out few months ago. TD has not started yet. Will start on Monday. I moved to Style 1.0L MT from AT due to airbag goofup by Skoda.

So, best to see and drive and experience ourselves. If you love the way a car looks, drives and just stands on your porch and that can remain unchanged for years, even over a decade, that's all that matters. As someone who hasn't changed his car for the last almost 12 years, I am in the market for a new car more than most people! Well, it's hard to let go of a much adored, trusted Punto and many here will know what I mean. I almost bought a Ford EcoSport, toyed with idea of taking the leap to buy the Compass but the pandemic put things on hold. With the Kushaq's announcement, I wanted to wait it out. I would like my next car also to be European and would love to have a Skoda in my garage. That said, I well realise that a Made for India tag is a euphemism, and like others, knew there would be some evident cost cuts. More than the lack of a panoramic sunroof or rear discs or a virtual cockpit, it's things like the tacky side aircon vents and the shoddily executed rooftop that hurt. But, hey, those apart, I doubt there's anything much that you really can pick on in the Kushaq, from what I hear. Am okay with the size and stance as I love the way it looks. I wouldn't need the rear seat much, so that's fine. The boots's fine too. The only thing I wish the Kushaq had is a diesel engine but then, there's nothing possible there. And am not complaining too much about the pricing. Yes, it's on the slightly premium side but nothing to put me off from considering the Kushaq.

735, dh.harshal , 11:59 ,BHPian,"Hottest TeamBHP thread still has divided opinion and it's becoming more difficult to either stamp Kushaq as winner or go with the Korean cars. My Personal opinion after seeing all cars in-person and being in love with my 5 year old Vento TSI DSG - Build quality Obviously Kushaq wins here, but it's not day & night as it was few years ago. Kushaq has better paint quality, just a little better quality interiors than the Koreans. Panel gaps are consistent across all these cars. Kushaq should have stronger frame/chassis, but how much stornger would be known only after objective NCAP rating. Engines & gearbox Skoda has better engines, there are no two ways about it. But if you read TeamBHP reviews for Seltos or Creta and you'll find that Koreans are not lagging far behind. The risk of Automatic gearbox failure is similar in both, but rectifying any issues with the car should be lot easier & cheaper in the Korean twins. Driving dynamics Here Kushaq is a real winner and you're likely to find out the difference when you drive these cars back to back. Ride & handling is immaculate in Kushaq; it's also very good in Seltos/Creta, but cannot match the Kushaq. Features Koreans win here hands down and Skoda/Volkswagen need to really catch up. Not all features are necessary, but no-one can deny utility of 360 degree camera or power adjusted seats. Space Obviously Koreans can accommodate 5 people and more luggage than Kushaq. Kushaq feels lot smaller from inside. Boot may be practical in Kushaq, but flat folding of rear seats is way better and recline adjustment of rear seat is a boon in Creta/Seltos. Now comes the most controversial part about safety. How can people call Kushaq a safe car without knowing NCAP ratings yet? On one hand they refuse to extrapolate NCAP rating of the same car outside India with it's Indian version, but are vouching for Kushaq based on historical data points of other VAG cars (not all of which are 5 stars). And If safety was just about hearing the THUD or stronger steel, wouldn't we be better off buying a truck or a tank. Then there's a big omission of 6 airbags and still people are fine with it. How can you be so sure of safety of your child sitting at the rear on the ISOFIX mounted seats without the cushion of airbags. Wouldn't a Heads-up display be better to keep your eyes in the road rather than continuously looking at the centre infotainment screen for the map directions? Just saying that Safety has multiple dimensions and not just the door closing sound. Now- Will I buy Creta or Seltos instead? Absolutely not! Will I buy Kushaq without NCAP rating/ 6 airbag? A THUD like NO. Will I pay 1 lakh more (~18.5 lakh) if Kushaq had six airbags, 360 camera & little more rear seat space? A definite YES. People who have driven VAG cars, vouch for them and wouldn't mind paying a handsome price premium and I wish Kushaq had that quality/feature premium in it to command even more price. But it has left me wanting for more. My final choice - I may wait untill end of the year for Monte Carlo/L&K version of Kushaq if it has at least 3 things - 6 airbags, 360 camera & power adjusted seat. If it doesn't come by end of the year, I would have to go all broke for Jeep Compass instead. P.S. Everyone would have his/her own preferences & priority weights for the car parameters.

We all know that the Europeans cannot cut cost like the Japanese and Koreans. It has been the case with Polo, Rapid, Vento... Pricing wise I definitely agree it's a premium and 2L cheaper would have been ideal but its something you have to accept with Euro brands. The Jeep Compass was same story when it launched. People cross shopping between Kia/Hyundai would crib as to how expensive the compass was with lesser space and lesser features and those who appreciated the attributes would not even look at the Koreans. No matter how much localisation, how many variants they tried, features juggling as well but they just couldn't compete on price with Kia/Hyundai. .. The only gross miss by Skoda remains that at this price point a Skoda buyer expects that the top AT variant will have all the features and not lose 6 airbags as you go up in variant. If they get this right, it's an easy pick. I said that the Skoda brand model is based on features at the given price point, not for everyone. The best comparison would be a Kodiaq vs X1/Q3 /GLA, I can a large SUV with space and features with a less premium badge or get a luxury badge and compromise on features. The same comparison won't be what buyers like me will do when it comes to mainstream brands, features trump any driving dynamics, the Creta and Seltos are not far behind. Europeans are adept at cost cutting, VW doesn't offer a diesel because they decided to forgo emissions hardware and now over compensate by not offering diesel altogether. Every review on their cars point to cheap trim all over the place and this is for really expensive performance versions The Jeep Compass has horrendous packaging, it feels cramped and claustrophobic , I sat in it immediately after I got out of my Punto as the brands share service facilities. Customers are right in calling it out, if Jeep is such a hard core SUV brand how come they offer a most versions of the compass in fwd? The Koreans are strong contenders, I like how people like to diss them for offering exactly what the market wants. The latest version of this is the sheet metal test, if the bonet is heavy then 5 stars else 2 stars, maybe NCAP is wasting time with crash testing, just use a scale to measure the weight of the bonet and doors and give stars based on how likely you are to dislocate your shoulder.

Mood was upbeat and looks like the response is good I am upgrading from Maruti Ritz, so felt plush in general Key observations 1. The seating is at comfortable height, feels good across seating positions. Driver's seat gave me a good comfortable feel 2. Lots of room at the back, hump in between is small. We are a small sized family (5.2-5.5), even then the 5th person can barely squeeze in. Liked the 3 pin seat belt for the middle passanger. But lot of leg space. 3. Hand brake is awkwardly placed towards left of the driver especially if the hand rest is fully pulled 4. Steering adjustments provides good flexibility. Over all driver should be happy with the feel, position and comfort. 5. Blind spots do exist. I found Sonet better with blind spots, Ritz is far worse. 6. The ceiling material is third grade, and is comparable to what I have in Ritz 7. Plastic pattern on the dashboard is ok but I didnt like it 8. The infotainment feels like a force fit, can potentially see dust accumulating on the edges. 9. Back seats felt comfortable, wide windows, does not feel claustrophobic (comparatively, TROC felt lot more claustrophobic and cramped at the back) Overall I liked the car, good looks and packaging. Skoda have done well here. Really hope we have good competition for the Koreans. Some minor niggles in finishing, plastics. The deal breaker for me has been lack of 6 airbags in 1.5DSG and hence will wait for Taigun to be launched. Hoping 1.5 DSG GT has 6 airbags, TPMS, Digital cockpit.

I'm glad a built-for-India product is getting equal treatment at least here. Someone has to kick start the transition, and Apple made a bold and essential move there. Tech gets better and the only way you can let go off legacy tech is by letting it go. As a product manager, going Type-C is a no-brainer. Keeping even one Type-A port would give customers the opportunity to complain about having only ""one"" useable USB port in a modern 2 million rupee car.

753, Axe77 , 17:17 ,Team-BHP Support,"I finally saw the Kushaq in the flesh yesterday at Mody Skoda, Worli and took a short test drive of the automatic 1.0 TSI around worli seaface and back. For good measure, I also visited Hyundai today and took a short test drive of their 1.5 iVT (automatic). My view on some key aspects, in some cases in isolation and in some as a comparative. Im not going to dwell upon some of the obvious like DSG issues, DCT issues, merits of extended warranty, brake failures and definitely not price. Enough is known and has been written on these aspects. 1. Size: Firstly, the Kushaq is definitely a pint smaller visually than the Creta. There is no escaping this. This is not only apparent from outside but also from inside. While driving the Creta I felt I was piloting a bigger car and sitting higher up than I felt in the Kushaq. The internal space offered by the Kushaq however feels as comfortable as the Creta on almost all metrics. There is no denying that this is an outright 4 seater and the 5th passenger space is very tight. I think a Creta definitely has a little more space for five. But lets not confuse size for presence. In terms of presence, it remains justifiably comparable to the Creta, albeit as a marginally smaller package. Personally, I dont need a car to have visual / external presence. What matters to me is the internal space and comfort that a vehicle provides  if it can do so in a more compact looking external façade thats a bonus. 2. Boot space: Lets get this out of the way too. The design of the Kushaq boot space is pretty well packaged and its likely that they will both swallow comparable amounts of luggage. If you fold down the seats, the Creta provides a much cleaner flat surface so you have to see how you may need your car boot (upright / folded) to be. Im a sucker for large boot capacity and honestly I find the space in the Kushaq perfectly acceptable. 3. External Design: Where both the Creta and Seltos try too hard in different ways and different degrees, the Kushaq design reeks of textbook Skoda / VW class. Clean, timeless lines. The car is very well proportioned and visually its hard to find a viewing angle that does not flatter the design. 4. Internal build quality and finish: I felt that the internal look and feel of the Kushaq and Creta are both lovely and both cabins are great places to be in. Both look well finished, with decent quality materials for most part and special in their own distinct way with a few things in either case that I dont care for. There are a few places where the quality looked a bit underwhelming, like the way the seat covers are wrapped in the Kushaq and some surfaces which are not really contact points. But in my view both cars are completely comparable in the overall quality and fit / finish of internal material. On that note, some specific points: - I dont care for this two spoke steering but I dont like the new Creta steering either. I like the 3 spoke design (like on the pre facelift Superb) the most and in general I like the 3 spoke designs. Both steerings look weird to (the Cretas looks like its trying too hard) and both would be a compromise aesthetically in my eyes. - For the price, I would really have liked electronic seat adjustment and not manual. - Sunroof: To me that ½ sunroof is as good as no sunroof. Im getting to be quite a sucker for this pano sunroof thing and love the one the Creta provides. - Paddle shifts: I love it that VAG / Koreans are giving this across the board right down to Venue / Polo level. @Jeep / @Tata: For heavens sake please take a cue from this and give these on your automatics. - Seat fabric seems comparable in both cars. But I love the way the seats of the Kushaq are contoured. This is what accentuates its unsuitability as a five seater but this is also what makes it brilliantly comfortable as a four seater. I would happily use the Kushaq as a part time chauffeur driven car with no qualms and actually prefer the back seat of the Kushaq over the Creta. - I didnt like the old school analog look of the Kushaq cockpit at all, that too in plain black and white in a really dull font. The Cretas digital looking one is much more in keeping with 2021 and personally I feel the Kushaq would look really dated very soon if not from the word go. I would really have liked a more modern looking cockpit  I suspect they may reserve this for a higher variant theyll launch later. - I dont care so much for 360 cameras etc but Im really annoyed at the skimping of 6 airbags (not a first I realise now after some more reading  this was done in the Rapid Monte Carlo too). Skoda is not providing a cut price product and it should know that its customers are consciously paying a premium for their offering. To skimp on a safety features that its well healed customers expect  not cool! 5. The drive: The 1.0 of the Kushaq simply owns the Creta on the driving experience. But this is not a Korean vs Euro thing. I suspect its more likely the torque converter stamping its superiority over a CVT, which is predictable. Its also important to remember that my drive was short and in city / traffic conditions. I dont have the benefit of a longer drive. But in the short city drive I did, the Kushaq does felt more special. It feels compact the way I would want my second car to feel without feeling small inside per se. I would definitely revisit this from a fresh perspective whenever I can get a chance to drive the DCT as well as the 1.5 DSG. But my sense is that the 1.5 DSG will be an absolute cracker to drive. This is one of the acid tests to determine which of the two top variants automatics is the pick of the lot. 6. Ride quality and comfort: Dynamically the Kushaq felt really sorted to drive and the ride quality felt better tuned than the Creta. Having said that, the Creta feels nothing like the Hyundais of yore (including my 2018 Grand i10). It feels really mature and well put together. I think people should stop pre  judging certain brands and judge each car on its individual merits. Honestly, the Creta I drove today doesnt feel like the typical floaty Hyundais of ten years ago and the internal fit and finish also is lovely. Equally, I was surprised to find that the Skodas steering was not as taut as I expected and had a slightly disconnected feel to it and had some play. End Notes: Overall, I think the Kushaq is definitely a super package and as said in the original review, brings a breath of European freshness into a segment very capably commandeered by the Koreans with support from the Indians and Chinese. You have to decide whether a package like this works for you. If bigger is better and visual street cred is important, there are MGs and Tatas which have reasonably competent offerings. The Koreans offer a superb all round package with good driving dynamics and feature laden too. My first blush reaction to the Koreans is that they do almost everything reasonably to very well and you definitely cant go wrong picking either of them. But the Kushaq is its own unique take on this segment in typical VAG style. And whatever little time I spent with it, I liked it!", 4th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Mumbai,"6,728","20,121","Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive
754, theguardian , 17:33 ,BHPian,"So, went to the Skoda showroom yesterday to check out the new Kushaq. I will keep it short with my observations. Size-wise, it's okay, not a very commanding one when compared to my Stallion (Kicks). The interior is neatly laid out, overall everything seems to be pretty sorted. Was fortunate enough to test drive both 1.0 Litre manual & automatic. A quick summary of both: 1.0 Litre manual The engine was good, seems to be a refined one. The clutch was not too hard or too soft, a balanced one, liked it. Input to throttle was well-received, steering was good to hold, inspired confidence in me while driving, not heavy, not too light, and balanced. Overall liked it!! 1.0 Litre automatic The real reason behind visiting the showroom was to test this engine & gearbox combination, One word; a rocket with a booster-jet!! You gotta trust me. Was very happy and came back home and started discussing with my family. The RM was kind enough to allow me to test drive the car back to my home so that my family members can also glance at it. Okay, the afternoon ended peacefully. In the evening, was talking to my Father and casually asked for his feedback; 2 observations: he felt the cabin to bit cozy as compared to Kicks, Kicks felt roomier he felt that he's sitting low when he occupied the co-driver seat for a few minutes. Point taken. Now the battle started between heart & head and when I am in such kind of situation, I resort to the ladies of the house, my Mother & Wife. So today morning, we all went to the showroom again to have a look at Kushaq. We all 3 sat in the rear seat and the decision was made instantaneously. a big NO. Well, I stand 5'10"" (78 Kg), and my mother and wife again are 5'4"" with normal weight, and considering our height & health, we sit quite comfortably in the Kicks but were not at all comfortable in Kushaq. I am fine with the rejection, thank you, ladies!!! We also sat in the Tata Altroz, the showroom was just adjacent to the Skoda one and the rear space in the Altroz surprised all of us, literally!! It's shortlisted but waiting for an automatic in it. One last note; was going through the brochure of Kushaq and realized that the active variant does not have a seat height adjustment for the driver, so folks who are considering the active variant please choose wisely.", 4th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Pune,53,164,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Exactly I was about to reply the same, being associated to the telecom industry I can say for sure that in next 2-3 years, all phones will come with type C only, and with 5G coming, I suppose everyone will change their mobile so in that sense I think it is a good decision by Skoda. Also, I am very happy that Skoda is not providing remote lock/unlock facility + engine start from app, it needs lot of heads to make it secure and even then it is not, look at Tesla (https://bugcrowd.com/tesla), researchers have found 555 security bugs in a company like Tesla, which is very focused in security. It is very hard to make devices secure unless company really focuses on it, Right now we are in a stage where competitors(Bluelink/UVO) app functionality itself is buggy, and as a security researcher when I look at app which looks weird, my eyes goes lit, and I can say from my experience till now, that the apps which has bugs in one direction must be vulnerable at others as well.", 4th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Hyderabad,116,557,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

While I got to see it in shades of Honey Orange and Candy White, I don't expect the others to lend the car a transformation. 3. The styling and design lines are sort of Seltosish.

775, rAijin_ , 17:25 ,BHPian,"Hello Team BHP-ians. Another newbie who just ( and finally ) got approved. Happy to finally be part of this community I have been following this thread and the one before Team BHP's Official review. The excitement everyone has for Skoda and VW twins is amazing. No wonder this thread was on fire. I am an enthusiast driver and hence would take sides with the Skoda/VW fans while trying to not be completely unjustified. Few points that I would like to contribute:Feature list vs Driving Dynamics - There is a lot of discussions and arguments on this point. - People who love the feature list that Koreans provide don't understand how a Skoda/VW C-SUVs can stand them with lesser feature list ( and size ). - Enthusiasts ( like me ) don't understand why features are so important when the car has great driving dynamics, is a lot safer and has great engines on offer. - And of-course most required features are provided as per segment and even Korean twins don't provide all features of each other ( Seltos - Creta ). - The only feature that I miss in the list is 360 deg camera or atleast for front and rear camera ( + sensors ) for easy parking. Although I am still very good with my Honda City rear camera ( + sensors ) and park at some really tight spaces, so Kushaq/Taigun shouldn't be a problem. - We have many upcoming competitors in the this segment from Citroen, Jeep, Ford, Toyota etc. Please don't expect them to provide features compared to the Korean Twins. - I think if you like Feature list, go with the Koreans and if you like driving dynamics, you can look at VW/Skoda. - Koreans are not bad at the driving dynamics. They have come a long long way from the old bouncy days. But, Still can't compare with VW/Skoda. - Lets not judge and blame brands for not giving everything. They won't. Safety - Explaining safety is usually very difficult. - Try explaining someone 40-50 yrs old importance of wearing helmet ( or at-least a good ISI marked helmet) on two wheeler when he has not done it for 20-30 years and is still doing great. - Coming back to C-SUV segment, Kushaq/Taigun are any day a lot lot safer than atleast the Koreans and MS ( unless new information is released ). - Just compare a Polo with MS Baleno or i20. There is no match. - And safety is not just how ""Tank like"" the car is. It is also the features that the Kushaq provides like electronic differential lock, brake disc wiping, multi-collision brake. - Jeep Compass is expensive because it provides a lot of safety features that I believe only luxury brands provide in their expensive models. - Yes, omission of 6 airbags on AT models is something that is a mistake and should be corrected. Pricing of Kushaq - The discussions on the expected price of Kushaq reminded me of Jeep Compass facelift thread. And how everyone was shocked when Jeep priced the facelift at a premium. - Similar thing happened with Kushaq and will happen with VW Taigun. - Skoda/VW in no way want to challenge and compete against the Koreans or even Maruti Suzuki in terms of numbers. They never said it and they never tried. - What they are targeting is 3k-5k per month with both Kushaq and Taigun. - I frankly believe Skoda/VW will achieve this quite easily even with this price-list. Who will buy Kushaq/Taigun - Trust me majority of buyers in India don't go as deep as the Team Bhp-ians go. They have money and they want to buy a car. They do not even understand the segments unless someone tells them specifically. - The following category of buyers will go with Skoda/VW anyday ( in my humble opinion )Enthusiasts and ex-Skoda/VW owners. Buyers who don't want to wait for 4-5 months. Buyers who consider Skoda/VW as premium brands. Buyers who want cars that are not so common on road ( Read Seltos, Creta ). My Plan: I like VW Taigun more than Kushaq and am waiting for its price list. I have driven both VW Polo and Skoda Fabia. Somehow, I preferred VW Polo's driving feel as compared to Fabia's. Hence Taigun over Kushaq. But, I don't see a point in changing from ( 5 yr old ) Honda City CVT during these Covid times and I won't be driving it much. So, I'll wait for a year. Let these issues of 2 airbags on AT, not-as-expected interior feel, strictly 4 seater etc get fixed. Wait for discounts to kick in. Wait for GT variant ( the one equivalent to the L&K or Monte Carlo of Skoda ) to launch with discount. I'll also check if Jeep, Citroen, Ford or Toyota provides a better package ( Similar driving dynamic and safety with better features ).

780, headbanger , 19:25 ,BHPian,"Spent a little time with Kushaq whilst not driving it. The showroom in Gurgaon got its display Kushaq today evening. I along with my wife reached the showroom before the display car arrived. Had to wait for 20 minutes. The display model was a white Ambition trim with manual transmission. 1. The looks of the car are typical Skoda. Graceful but nothing in your face and I like that. 2. The car has a resemblance to S cross in stance. It's no way as butch as even a Sonet. But it has a personality of its own. Make no mistake about that. 3. Sizewise it's not a Seltos nor a Sonet either. It's a car that looks small on outside but is impressive on space inside. 4. Unlike Koreans where one can immediately see the differences between mid and top variants, even the Ambition variant looks good in isolation. 5. The external build quality is top notch, at least from the touch and general feel perspective. If this car doesn't manage to score on crash testing, that will be a serious surprise. You can immediately make out the heft on all panels, paint quality is impressive as well. 6. Boot is usable for the layout but for a family which travels with luggage like movers and packers, this ain't the car. You need to be intelligent while packing. 7. My first hunch was if the car tires are a shade narrower. I need to confirm it again. But I like how Sonet's tires are. 8. Coming to interior, it's a strict 4 seater. The good part is that the rear seat offers very good under thigh support. If suspension is good, this seat could give a nice ride for long distances. 9. There is claustrophobic feeling on the rear though. 10. The dashboard layout is very impressive. It's minimalist and doesn't look cluttered. I loved this part. 11.I didn't like the seat covers or the color pattern on the car. Even Rapid wears better clothes inside. Give some life to the colors Skoda. 12. I will be driving the car with family in a week or two. I am eyeing 1 litre automatic transmission. The idea is to have Sonet and Seltos with me on the test drive day. Both the existing cars have diesel automatic. I have to see how logistically I get all 3 cars in the same time frame. The idea is to see what compromise I need to make should I opt for Kushaq. 13. Howsoever paradoxical it may sound, I still stand by my initial assessment of the car being overpriced even though the car is impressive on many counts. 14. The fact that my wife loved this car to bits is a serious factor for the purchase. Since she is going to drive this car, the choice has to be hers. All I desire is to ensure that she is in a safe car. Had either of Kias be proven safe, the purchase would have been made 6 months back. The back up purchase in case Skoda doesn't make the cut will be either of Kias. After all the noise and shouting I did when the prices were shared, if I end up purchasing this car, it will be like season of eggs on my face. I made my family wait for half an year for this car and my assumption on the budget was off the mark. But hey, I won't be doing justice to the forum if I didn't share the other side of the coin.

Very roomy rear seats (in terms of legroom)  Comes with a comprehensive safety feature list including 6-airbags, ABS, EBD, EDL, TPMS and the likes  Good variant and feature spread. I believe the Kushaq offers just the right number of variants with even the base trim coming well kitted  Both the 1.0 and 1.5 TSIs cover most of the buyer base. 1.0 for the fuel economy and budget conscious buyer, 1.5 TSI for the enthusiast or someone who doesnt mind splurging for the top end variant What I didnt like:  Quality of some interior bits is iffy. Parts like the ac vent controllers, steering mounted scrollers and the likes dont feel like they will last the distance  The DQ200 is not the most reliable gearbox out there (though Skoda does claim they have strengthened the mechatronics)  I believe this is a good car, but not a great car. A price band of around 9.5L to 16 odd lakhs ex showroom would have made it an even more compelling proposition  Some misses in terms of features. Height adjustable seatbelts, a proper rough road package with a proper sump guard for the gearbox and oil sump, digital cockpit and colour adjustable ambient lighting are conspicuous of their absence. Top end AT doesnt even get curtain or shoulder airbags  Though the rear legroom isnt an issue, seating three abreast at the rear is still a challenge due to the reasons I have highlighted below  Skodas after sales and the unproven long-term reliability of the engines is still a worry in my opinion Introduction Friendly bhpian porsche_guy and I both went to check the Kushaq out at the nearest Skoda dealer. This experience as a whole was quite unique as: - He owns a 2014 Vento 1.6 MPI Manual and yours truly owns a 2014 Jetta TDI manual. Both of us would benchmark both these cars (The Vento especially) against the Kushaq - Both of us have visited numerous dealerships to check out cars before including Hyundai/Kia, Tata, Maruti Suzuki and the likes. This was the first time we were walking into a Skoda dealership to check out a brand-new mass-market product and I think many readers here will echo the same sentiment. This is literally a ""make it or break it"" car for Skoda India. Its what the Jeep Compass was to FCA (or rather couldn't be) or the Ecosport was to Ford. Exteriors and Build The car exceeded expectations in this department. The first thing that caught my eye when I saw the car up-close were the tight panel gaps. Shut lines are very consistent all throughout. The laser welded roof which sits perfectly flush with the car and the neatly integrated spoiler (most manufacturers mess up and leave an ugly gap here) on the hatch, along with the paint quality (evident especially on this honey orange shade) are exactly in line with what you would expect from a German car. Coming to the headlamps, these are the LED Projectors with the LED DRLs on the top end Style variant. Notice the engraving inside. You have to give it to Skoda for paying attention to these finer details: Halogen fog lamps are set a lot higher than one would expect them to be. This leaves a rather ungainly blank at the bottom of the bumper in the form of a plastic insert at the bottom of the bumper: Top notch paint quality and tight panel gaps. Little to no orange peel visible and this Honey Orange shade also has a very prominent metallic effect: Skoda badged insert on the front fender is tastelessly done in our opinion: 17 inch diamond cut alloys finished in dual tone shod with rather clumsy 205/55 Apollo Alnacs (dont know what it is with VW/Skoda and pathetic OE tyres). Note the lug nut caps here. I found these alloys to look classy, porsche_guy thinks otherwise: Frameless wipers or at least covers for the spindles on these (similar to what Tata does) would have looked much better. Washer jets are neatly concealed underneath the bonnet on a cowl panel: In typical VAG style, the chassis number is neatly accommodated in a recess below the windscreen. Easily visible, but only physically accessible from under the bonnet: Non-functional roof rails feel solid enough but you cant load anything onto them. Notice the laser welded roof which eliminates the need for any black beading (due to the use of spot welds on other cars): Door handle with a chrome strip running between it. Request sensors for the keyless start/stop system are available on both the driver and passenger sides (are you listening Hyundai?): Very well integrated spoiler. Tight panel gaps all round: Rear end looks neat for the most, except for the chrome strip at the bottom of the bootlid which we found to be extremely tacky. The Kushaq follows Skodas new convention of omitting the logo and spelling S-K-O-D-A out instead: 95RON is the optimum spec of fuel for this TSI. 91 is the least you can go down to: Very weirdly, it seems the sticker on the driver door sill dictates one should follow the TPMS recommendations on the infotainment and set pressures accordingly. Would have been nice to have the numbers included here itself: Full cladding in the front and rear wheel wells.

797, vishy76 , 08:09 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Interiors The interiors of the Kushaq are ergonomically well appointed. I found everything where it should have been in typical German fashion. What I didn’t quite like was the attention to smaller details that you naturally expect from a German car that is priced above competition. The dash design is quite unconventional considering what we have seen before from VW/Skoda. Gone are the smaller touchscreens integrated into the lower half of the dash flanked by buttons and in comes the tablet like infotainment system. I didn’t get a chance to experience the HU unfortunately, so I wont pass verdicts on it. The two spoke steering (which porsche_guy will elaborate on further) is set in front of a rather simple looking analog cluster. While I personally love the analog dials (especially the temperature and fuel guages), I didn't quite like the MID. Its a monochrome unit similar to the one seen on the 3rd gen pre-faclift Octavia and numerous other PQ platform VAG cars too. A colour MID would have definitely been a welcome addition considering competition has now moved onto fully digital instrument clusters (something its VW sibling has the bragging rights to). Commanding driving position. What I love is the fact that the bonnet is clearly visible from the driver's seat: Just to the right of the steering are the headlamp controls. The headlamp control switch looks dull and could have done with some chrome or aluminium. To its left is the headlamp leveler scroller: Centre console with the larger than life infotainment screen and the two ac vents placed below. porsche_guy thinks the high set infotainment screen makes it far easier to view it on the move and complements the commanding driving position perfectly. On the other hand, the low set ac vents are a bit counter intuitive. Hot air usually rises up and cold air sinks towards the bottom. Thus its better to have ac vents placed high up in the cabin (a practice one follows even in home air conditioning systems). Most of the plastics on the dash area and door pads are hard to touch. They aren’t shiny (like I noted on the Seltos), but they aren’t really upto 18-20L German car standards either. The piano black finish (used extensively on the dash and the recess for the interior door handles) is a fingerprint magnet. The one material I did really like was the textured grey finish. A welcome change in a sea of piano black and carbon fibre plastics seen in the Kushaq as well as its Korean counterparts: Map lights and sunroof controls. The slider for the sunroof felt very flimsy to touch and use. Twin LED map lights look premium. Nope, that isn’t a sunglass holder at the back, its just a dummy panel: VW seems to have a fetish with deleting leather wraps on handbrakes. The Polo/Vento saw it first and now the Kushaq doesn’t have one. The handbrake is possibly the worst part in the entire cabin to touch: With the passenger seat pushed all the way forward. I could stretch out comfortably: Nifty phone holder offered with the seat back pocket. The seatback isn’t hard like the Seltos/Creta in spite of having the ventilated seat setup. Having said that, the rexin like material used here doesn’t really set standards for quality: Rear armrest is composed of the exact same material. It doesn’t have the satisfying click into place action that the previous VAGs had. It just drops down abruptly and sits there, Also the leather trim doesn’t seem to be quite well fitting. Notice the tastefully applied orange stitching in the background on the seat: Another issue that crops up is the fact that the rear armrest (even in its stowed position) protrudes out a bit. This coupled with the fact that the seats for the rear passengers sitting towards the sides are contoured aggressively, means I was sitting a bit higher than the other two passengers would and even a bit towards the front. The only saving grace for the middle passenger is the floor hump in the middle isn’t very high: Window switch console feels durable but the plastics surrounding it feel low rent. Overall quality of plastics on the doorpads and the dash won't set benchmarks for quality as we have seen with so many other Germans: AC vent controls feel very flimsy. To shut the vent, slide the chrome tab all the way to the left. Engravings on top of the vent dictate the same. I would have liked it if they could be open and shut simply by sliding up and down (like in so many other cars). A proper air volume controller is conspicuous of its absence on all of the vents! Headliner feels more hard wearing than plush. The upside is that the upholstery won’t sag with age while the downside is that it doesn’t feel very premium to touch: Eeks. The entire headliner around the map light console flexes when you push it hard. Not expected from a Skoda: Grab handles are provided for all occupants (including the driver). They don't have a damped feel though. Its surprising a manufacturer like Skoda who set these standards has become oblivious to them. Don't miss the coat hook: Two USB-C ports at the bottom of the rear AC vents. Nifty addition: Engine Bay 1-litre TSI leaves a lot of space unused in the engine bay. It’s the exact same unit seen in the Polo/Vento/Rapid: Uniquely, this car came equipped with a SEBANG battery (I am used to seeing VARTAs and Exides as OE batteries on VAGs): ECU sits towards the right of the battery. Gets its own cowl on top. Positioning is very similar to my Jetta: Coolant expansion tank sees a change in shape as compared to yesteryear VAGs. Also comes equipped with a nifty coolant level sensor to warn you if the level drops too low: The charge air cooler placed underneath here: Wiper washer fluid cap is placed towards the right-hand side near the headlamp. Very easy to access: Disturbing to see absolutely no underbody protection here. The oil filter (cylindrical piece placed horizontally towards the centre- left of this image at the very front), the oil sump (black in colour) and the gearbox (right) are all exposed to the elements outside: ", 6th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,BDQ,"1,249","9,801","Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive
798, porsche_guy , 08:09 ,BHPian,"So on a random sunday morning, I gave a call to Ananth(BHPian Vishy76). The Skoda Kushaq had just recently launched and we were dying to have a look at this important ""make it or break it car"" from Skoda in India. So the plan was set and we decided to meet up at the local dealership for a thorough look around the car and here are my observations apart from Ananth's. The variant we got to see was the Style 1.0 TSI MT in Honey Orange colour. Since he has dug deep into the likes and dislikes and various other aspects, I have made sure to have not overlapped with his review. These are my observations- Exteriors The first look at the car as we entered was the front 3 quarters. To be honest, it comes off as a rather imposing car with a vertical nose which enhances its ""SUVness"" which is quite needed considering its compact proportions. That said, this clearly is not a hustler unlike its rivals like say the Creta. The front profile is dominated with the signature Skoda grille which is quite large in size, again to enhance its proportions. Below it is a neatly done number plate recess. Notice the well concealed tow hook cover on the left. Below the lower air dam is the faux skid plate which looks horrible. A look at the headlamp and foglight cluster. While Ananth doesn't mind, I find it to be quite odd looking. IMO The front end would have had a cleaner look if the fog lamp was put below, in the dummy air vent which is very apparent. Coming to the rear three quarters, it is very straightforward without any excess chrome or busy elements ala Seltos. The boot looks truncated which is an absolute puzzler for me considering that this isn't a sub4m vehicle at all anyways. The rear profile gives a heavy Volvo-esque vibe with the slim, boomerang shaped taillamps and the S-K-O-D-A lettering. It has a nice, clean and sleek look. The only downer for me here is the chrome strip but given the average indian customer, I can see why skoda did it. Only 3 parking sensors and the cheap looking wiper make me go The wheel design is a bit controversial among us. While Vishy76 is a fan of them, I find them quite ugly. They're shod with 205/55 R17 rubber from Apollo. Good tyre size but average quality. Some other smaller details- Indicator slightly juts out from the ORVM housing. Beware of bikers! The beautiful detailing on the taillamps; should have been all LED units Shark fin Antenna is finished in black; juts out IMO but Ananth loves it. Paint quality and panel gaps are quite good. This colour(Honey orange) is very pretty and honestly pictures don't do justice to it. The quality is typically VAG with a rich colour and little orange peel effect. Panel gaps are also quite good. They are consistent in most places and quite tight. However I must point out, my Vento still has even tighter panel gaps. Here is the Kushaq in Tornado Red and Candy White- ", 6th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,GJ06<=>GJ01,884,"3,097",Body Exterior and Paint,Very Positive
799, porsche_guy , 08:10 ,BHPian,"Interiors As soon as you open the door, you notice the thickness of them. They feel quite substantial and have a solid typical VAG thud. Something that surprised me in a good way after the claimed 95% localization levels. The interiors are nice, however you will be disappointed with the part quality if you're coming from a proper VAG from before. The dash has a good layout and ergos for the most part are bang on. The gear lever fits nicely into your hands and other switch gear is also placed conveniently. One thing I should point out is the positioning of the touchscreen which falls into the driver's field of view making it easier to operate while on the move unlike the Creta's or the Brezza's units which would have you take your eyes off the road to operate them. The steering is nice and chunky to hold. It looks quite cool too and the two spoke design adds flair to the cabin. The leather on the steering feels quite strange and rough to touch. The buttons also have a lot of play in them and don't feel quite as premium as one would have thought. Ananth says the Seltos he checked out few months back had better quality steering mounted controls. Here is the view from my eye level after adjusting the seat to my position- As you can see, the bonnet is clearly visible and the view out is quite wide. Headroom was also good enough for me. We operated the clutch and gearshift while the car was off and surprisingly the clutch was incredibly soft and had a good linear feel to it. Pedals are also well placed and at the same height unlike my Vento where the clutch pedal is a bit higher than the others. The gearshift action was quite precise and had short throws but wasn't as slick as one would have expected. Maybe my expectations were too high coming from the absolutely amazing gearshift action on my Vento?. On a serious note though, we checked a Brezza right afterwards and it had a much better shift action. The start stop button was conveniently placed away from the reach of passengers. It lights up when the door is open and stays on till about 8 seconds after shutting the door. Arguably the most important feature in today's days. It's often called this car's drawback since it doesn't have the large panoramic one but I feel for the size of the car, this is more than enough. One neat touch is that Skoda has provided a proper hard and opaque cover instead of just cheapening out with a translucent one like in the previous Octavia. Exposed mechanicals look super ugly. Wireless charger (with a nice little phone shaped mould) provided. Lack of Type A USB ports is disappointing. Centre console. AC Controls are based on a touchscreen but the markers are stickers and don't disappear Skoda Sound tweeters look nice Driver gets a grab handle as well! Not a common sight. Front seats are nice and chunky unlike the Polo triplets which have tight and thin front seats. Good bolstering too. Centre console has good storage and the armrest(feels nice though not very useful) folds up to reveal a nice, large compartment. Here is a small water bottle for comparison Moving on to the rear seat, it is very spacious. Chauffeur driven guys will love this. It becomes a limo with the front seat all the way forward! The floor hump is also gone and the long wheelbase means the centre passenger isn't punished. Here is BHPian Vishy76 (5'11)in the middle. He says the backrest protrudes too much and is hard meaning this is a 5 seater only for the occasional trips. Two USB Type-C chargers are also provided under the AC vents. The seats on the sides have good bolstering and the seat material also feels nice and soft to touch. Headrest and three point seatbelt for the middle passenger is awesome! Horrid panel gap between the rear door card and B pillar Now, for the most controversial thing on the entire car, Boot Space! I and Vishy76 both agree that the boot is large enough for most people. While 385L is a bit too less on paper, the boot is very nicely shaped and usable. There are even cubbyholes given on the two rear corners. Here is my L sized helmet for comparison( along with some Skoda accessories).

800, porsche_guy , 08:10 ,BHPian,"Verdict Both, me and Vishy76 unanimously agreed on the fact that the Kushaq is a good package. Acceptable quality levels, a good feature list and a spacious cabin. However what was extremely apparent was that the Kushaq simply couldn't match up to the levels of finesse of his Jetta or for the fact, even my Vento. We simply couldn't digest the dilution in quality, especially with a Skoda badge on the hood. Both of us were looking forward to this critical launch since the past few months as we were not able to find suitable replacements of both our cars and hoped the Kushaq will be the one. However, that didn't happen and coming out of the showroom, we were sure that this pursuit is not going to end soon. We even asked a fellow gentleman there who was looking to replace his WR-V but even he said the same thing that its a good car, just not a great one. Skoda is 90% there but in such a crowded segment, it is the last 10% that matters. What doesn't help matters is that the car is overpriced by atleast 1.5 to 2 lakhs across variants and we feel it will do about 1500 units a month, Far below Skoda's 5000 units target.

805, AMG Power , 10:44 ,Senior - BHPian,"On the Hyundai vs Skoda / VW debate: At the highest level of the game, where manufacturers throw everything they have to prove that their cars have the best performance, handling and reliability, Hyundai have trounced Skoda / VW. Hyundai have won the world rally championship (WRC) twice in a row - in 2019 and 2020 - beating not just VW / Skoda but all the other manufacturers. Which goes to show that at the highest level, Hyundais engineering prowess is amongst the best in the world. Its no surprise then that their 1.4 GTX turbo in the Kia Seltos is faster than Kushaqs 1.5 TSI even though it has a smaller displacement and lower power output. The Seltos isnt a bad handler either. H O W E V E R Hyundai know that it doesnt make business sense to give anything more than commercially acceptable quality to the customer. They also know that 99% of Indian customers would prefer a Bose system to a 5 star crash test rating, an air purifier to handling prowess, and Christmas tree lights to door thuds. So Hyundai gives the customer what he wants and laughs all the way to the bank. You cant blame someone for being successful in business. Now a new dimension to Skoda customers horror stories: In addition to the trauma, horror and cheating that takes place in Skoda ASS, a new dimension has emerged - it now takes 20 days after booking to get a slot to service your car at most Skoda dealerships. And this is before the Kushaq onslaught. Once Kushaqs pile up at the ASS, one will probably have to wait much longer to get your car serviced. Sure, new dealerships are being appointed but they appear to be on top of the Himalayas, in the middle of the desert or in Timbuktu, not in areas where there are customer bases or where there are pileups. (read metros). Most of the new dealerships in the vague places will close down in a year or two.

806, Pancham , 10:57 ,Senior - BHPian,"I dont think any Skoda executive wakes up in the morning and thinks ""Lets sprinkle a few bad quality parts in the upcoming Kushaq which is also our most important offering the Indian market. Indians deserve some bad quality parts"". Nah! I think its more about economies of scale and if they provide a PERFECT vehicle how their cost could go up and that would entail them to sell a 'minimum' number of vehicles to break even. Perhaps, Skoda knows they cannot sell that 'minimum' number which could well be in the range of ~ 7k-10k per month. Hence they agree upon a middle ground. A business decision perhaps. This could be one of the reasons for not being able to provide as many features as a Creta. Skoda is going through the same thing with Hyundai/Kia, what Hyundai went through when competing with Maruti in the mid to late 2000s. We all know Skoda cannot sell that many no matter what. Even if they put gold and diamonds in the AC vents Indians wont buy as many as they would in case of a Creta/Sonet. Hence, based on a cost benefit analysis they may have ended up compromising on a few parts. They are running a business after all and their acceptable thresholds in terms of sales numbers could be based on their internal calculations and agreements within the management and stakeholders. This is just my view. As for Skoda vs. Hyundai, enough has been said. I have owned (and lived with) 2 Hyundai cars in the past 10 years and I can for sure say that I am not touching another Hyundai in the next decade or so. The steering module issue in my i20 (the issue has plagued several other Hyundais as well) which made the steering lose power and made it stiff was a dangerous problem in my view and Hyundai, despite knowing this, never made an attempt to fix/recall/provide goodwill warranty. That itself shows their attitude towards customers/Indian market. This is one of many problems that plague Hyundai cars but no one seems to talk about it. Skoda at least acknowledges the gearbox issues here. The DQ200 can leave you stranded but a steering module conking off in the highway can reduce you to living inside a photo frame within hours. Hyundais are nice cars for the first 3-4 years but they don't age well. You will see when you own one past 5 years. Overall, I think the Kushaq is a superb package and at 15.58L OTR in Kolkata, the Ambition trim with 1.0 AT will be my pick. Attaching the price list for reference.

I spent good 1.5 hours or so at the showroom , test driving the vehicle thoroughly for around 15 Kms. (I am talking about the manual) Here are my observations: Exteriors: 1. Loved the car's size . it is just appropriate fine and looks clean and subtle from all angles, elegant lines and feels well put up. Did not find inconsistencies in the panels. 2. The alloys look fabulous and comes with ""not so good"" Apollo Alnac rubber, better tyres recommended for potential buyers. 3. Boot area is cleverly designed, can gulp good quantity of bags since its deep enough as compared to its counterparts. 4. Blacked out lights with DRLs look cool, especially on the silver variant. DRLs are standard across all variants. 5. Tinted glasses seems to do the work and look fine. Interiors: 1. The steering design is unique, feels nice to hold and leather wrap quality is strictly average. 2. Ergonomics are fine except, I was unable to find a place to rest my right arm while driving since the height of windows is higher as compared as comparable to other vehicles I have driven. I really wished this was not the case. I would like to hear on this from fellow bhpians please. 3. Plastic quality felt better than the Creta's , although the air vents fins seemed very flimsy as pointed out by others as well. 4. Cabin is silent and feels secure, the doors are heavy as Skoda's doors are and instils confidence. 5. Sunroof is namesake and exposed hinges makes the matter worse, not good Skoda. You may check the pictures to understand the atrocity 6. Touchscreen's feel and shape and the way is designed in the overall interiors feels nice and aesthetically pleasing. Did not try it much since driving is what I was more focused towards. 7. Rear leg room is good, I am stout, 5.11"" and as per my front seating, I was able to sit comfortably at the rear. Much better than ecopsort or Sonet, but then- that's a wrong comparison I guess. However, the rear seats are hard and one gets that feel immediately after sitting on them, and yes, it is strictly a 4 seater. 8. Side pockets felt useful and power window buttons felt robust. The Drive: 1. Loved the way she pulls, although bit more linear as compared to the Rapid. 2. Turbo lag is felt at low rpms but is definitely liveable. 3. The steering feel is as I predicted, no nonsense, no dead feel. Very responsive and weighs perfectly as per the speed. 4. Suspension seems to be tuned somewhere in between soft and stiffer side. I felt it was fine, did not feel much body roll although it was not sedan territory which is obvious for a higher GC vehicle. 5. The horn is paltry and and does not suit the car one bit. Unnecessary cost cutting. 6. Insulation seemed fine to me, I drove the car upto 140 km/hr and the sound proofing was spot on. 7. I would anyway feel more confident taking turns, doing high speed manoevurs and braking while driving the Kushaq as compared to the Creta. The car handles nicely and in a contained manner. 8. Tested the cruise control, it is simple to operate and as opposed from many other vehicles which activate post minimum speed of 40 km/hr., the Kushaq's cruise control can be activated from min. speed of 20km/hr. The ""hidden"" Competitor: To many on this forum and across the internet, the primary competitor to Kushaq is Creta/ Seltos and I understand the same owing to the same price bracket and stance of the vehicles.However, since I had good amount of time to spend at the showroom, I took the liberty of driving the Skoda Rapid as well, just to understand the reason for a difference of 3 lakhs between the two vehicles, both having the same engine. I do not want to start a debate here, but I failed to understand why anyone would spend 12.xx lakhs for OTR price of a Kushaq while he/she can get the same pleasure (rather better) while driving the Rapid. Compared to Kushaq, the Rapid: Felt more eager, more planted and more sorted fundamentally. Its steering connect felt even better. Has humongous boot. Has proven safety. Provides better seat comfort (rear) I believe the few things going towards Kushaq's way is the novelty factor, increased Ground clearance and additional gizmos and features (in top spec variants). The Verdict Kushaq is a good product, although cost cutting (especially in its interiors) is evident as compared to other Skoda's we have seen in India including the Fabia and Yeti. Since I am not very fond of sub 4 metre vehicles the Kushaq makes its own case of being neither here nor there. That being said, over the Korean twins, if resale does not bother someone much and he/she wants to keep the car for a longer duration, has a decent service centre nearby, I would definitely recommend going ahead with the Kushaq, especially the active trim as compared to the E variant of Creta , which is too bare bones and has atrocious waiting periods. Mind it, it shall be a pure heart over head decision but given the felt safety and dynamics, the Kushaq will surely bring smile to the driver's face , although for a much wider smile and that too at a lesser amount I would suggest the Rapid to all driving enthusiasts, you need to drive her to understand the joy. Thank you fellow bhpians for showing patience and reading through, I would let the pictures do the talking now.", 6th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Jalandhar,286,541,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

As rightly pointed out by you, it lacks a USP. So, I would have called it a decent-to-good package if it would have been priced lower. By offering less features and inferior interior quality (relative to their own cars which are priced lower, Maruti is not a good comparison as they don't have any offering in this segment) and pricing it at the top of the segment, SKoda/VW has screwed up big time. This reminds me of Honda's terrible attempt at capturing the Indian market with cars like BRV which were decent offerings but lacked the finesse and quality of typical Honda cars and were priced higher compared to the competition. This makes me wonder why global powerhouses like VW/Honda/Toyota are not able to compete in India.

The EcoSport and Nexon are too small in front of the Kushaq. There is no comparison - neither in size nor in quality. In fact, quality wise too the Kushaq is much better than the compact SUVs you mentioned. It is similar in size to the S-Cross, but has many more features and better build + good engine.

829, #drivingFreak , 20:41 ,Newbie,"Hello everyone, this is my first post on Team BHP forum and this trending thread feels like a good place to start. I was out for getting a haircut but there were lot of customers in there so I was told to come back in 30 mins. So I took this opportunity and went ahead and took a test drive of the Skoda Kushaq as there's Skoda showroom right next to my house. The showroom only has the 1l style variant on display and for test drive. I am not a prospective buyer but just wanted to check out the car. First look Impressions- -The doors, the bonnet and the boot lid have some good weight to them, similar to to other VAG cars. -The car doesn't look very butch like a SUV apart from the front end but looks good for what it is, a crossover. -The interiors look good at first site and and I feel has a no nonsense layout . -Front seats feel good to sit in and ergonomics of the car feel good. -The steering wheel does look and feel good in hand. I am not so sure about the longevity of the knurled switches on the steering if operated agqressively. -Cost cutting have been made in the interiors as pointed out by other bhpians, specially in the touch and feel of the roof and the AC vent adjustment controls. -The roof was flexing a bit when I operated the light switches in the rear and that doesn't induce much confidence or a premium feel in the car. -The rear seat is comfortable with good thigh support(I am 5'10) and ample space is there to slip in your foot under the front seats. It even has a foot rest there. -The car does feel a little cramped at the back, not something you'll feel in the front. -Boot space looks good but the seats albeit having 60-40 split, don't fold flat, and that high loading lip could make it cumbersome for loading and sliding heavy luggage. Drive Impressions(1l Manual Style variant)- - The bonnet is clearly visible while driving, and the overall visibility is pretty good. - The engine is smooth and refined for a 3 cylinder and I didn't feel any vibrations at ideal. - The car has a good pickup and I wasn't expecting that from a 1l unit, I had previously experienced this engine in the Polo which was super fun and I must say it didn't feel much different here in the Kushaq in my short test drive. -The gearshifts aren't as smooth as the diesel Altis I have been driving FOR the past few days. The gear throws are short and pretty precise, the gear lever itself is nice and small and feel good to hold. -The clutch doesn't have much weight to it and and the travel is also manageable. -The breaks are great on this car, they have a good feel and a sharp bite and induce a lot of confidence in braking and the absence of rear discs isn't felt. For comparison, the 2017 Altis has all 4 discs and they too have a very good feel and induce similar kind of confidence in braking. -The steering is light at slow speeds and feels accurate. -The suspension setup is also great on this car, there are a few undulations on the road I drove and at similar speeds both the Altis and i20 2020 felt a little bouncy on that patch, but the Kushaq stays stable and planted. The ride quality can be a USP for this car. -The car as a whole feels nimble and chuckable and should be easy to use in the city -The test drive vehicle had just done 530kms, so I refrained myself from giving the full beans but the engine should be fun to drive just like in the Polo Few other thoughts- -The salesman attending me had just joined a few days back and seems like Skoda is getting a expected good response. According to him, the sales people had attended over 100 people in previous couple of days and they have also received over 30 bookings, most of which were for the 1l variants. -The Kushaq is making people enter Skoda showroom who otherwise wouldn't even consider a Skoda or any other German car and allow them to experience what the Germans have to offer. I am sure, quite a few people will come out happy with what they experience. -Kushaq can be very good and comfortable city car for 4 adults, it has more space in the rear than the sub 4m cars and being smaller than the Koreans would make it easier to maneuver in the city. -The Kushaq has good amount of passive safety features as standard. -The only downside I feel is the pricing and the lack of 6 airbags in the top automatic variants of both engines, the car could have started a new segment between the sub 4m cars and the mid size SUVs had it been priced maybe a 1-1.5l cheaper for the top variants of both the engines. -The overall package is good and one should experience it for themselves but without any pre conceived notions. Everyone has different needs and I am sure there are potential customers for this product too. -I really want this product to be a success so that we get more exciting and affordable products from the Germans in the future because they do seem to have a upper hand in the driving feel compared to others in our market and that's what matters to me personally. -Ritesh", 6th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,"Panjim,",20,180,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

The Kushaq is almost 80mm shorter in length and 25mm narrower in width than the S-Cross. The S-Cross matches the Korean twins in almost every external dimension except for the height.

IMHO Silver was the best looking. Showroom response was okayish. The guy I was in touch with was finishing off the sale for Octavia so he handed over all the Kushaq keys to another guy in the dealership. I had to remind him about putting on the mask for 2-3 times before he finally obliged. All the Kushaqs were parked in the basement workshop since the owner wanted to unveil the cars in a grand ceremony on Wednesday Jul 7, 2021 involving balloons and all. Front seats are comfortable but rears seats are just okayish. You would only be able to sit 2 adults and 1 kid in the backseat if safety is one of the reasons you are buying it. For most of my childhood I was sitting in the lap of one of my Mausis during such journeys with no regards to safety. I know it was a horrible decision on behalf of my parents and other relatives but since most of them are already dead I can't blame them much. I don't know a single kid who would be ready to sit in the middle seat for a long time fore-going the masti of the corner seat. And if a kid is sitting in one of the corner seats then the other 2 adults won't enjoy the ride comfortably for sure. I asked whether an ISOFIX can be fixed at the middle seat, the person attending had zero idea. I will take the TD of 1.0 AT on Saturday with my father to see how it drives.

I enquired at the Skoda dealership about the bookings on June 29, 2021; they told me they had bookings for 39 Kushaqs - 10 of 1.5 DSG MT and 9 of 1.5 MT. But on Jul 5 they told me they have bookings for 41 Kushaqs in total. I asked them how come bookings have slowed down so much, they told me that waiting is over 2 months now and they don't want any disgruntled customers since in a small town like Udaipur people don't want to wait that much for a car. I just rolled my eyes and went out. Also when I enquired about the essential kit he told me that I can't buy my car without that; I immediately told him to cancel my booking. Then he softened up and said that we are supposed to push that but for you my lord, we won't be doing that. I laughed and told him to take care of himself and his family.

One, because it's too hot to shoot the cabin without the a/c on most days. Second, if the car needs to be continuously moved for exterior shots & angles, better to keep the engine running than stop / restart all the time. Owner reviews are the most reliable source.

I can completely understand that you are disappointed with the looks of a vehicle, but, I would like to point out there is more to a car than dimensions on paper. The Kushaq actually has the most legroom and most comfortable seats amongst the cars you have mentioned. Quote: Originally Posted by vishnurp99 The Kushaq 1 litre MT will get compared against the S-cross and Creta NA petrols. In terms of interior room, Kushaq is below Scross & Creta. The build is not significantly better for Kushaq either. A buyer will need to decide if he would prefer to have 1 litre turbo petrol or 1.5 L NA petrol with similar power figures. The vehicle is just too overpriced and there are too many skoda horror stories that will dissuade most folks from paying a premium for 1 litre version. I am not even talking about the 1.5L here. In a country where we cross shop across segments and vehicle types, I am sure that the Kishaq will face stiff competition from a Baleno to a Tiguan and everything in-between. Incidentally, I would recommend most people to ignore the 1 Litre offerings. One needs a bit of grunt to safely navigate our treacherous road conditions. I don't particularly think that the 1.5 is adequately powered by modern standards either. Acceptable perhaps but certainly not adequate. When seen objectively in person, the Kushaq is the most comfortable car when you look at the S Cross and Creta. 3 years down the road, the Creta will look old and dated, while the Kushaq will look just as dated as the day you drive off the lot. Let me be clear, the Kushaq already looks dated, the S Cross more so. Skoda A.S.S is what it is. No point dwelling on it, other than to point out to a potential buyer who hasn't done their homework that Skoda service can be a nightmare, but actually, only if something goes catastrophically wrong with the vehicle. Atleast that is what I and many other multiple VAG car owners will tell you. The sad truth of the matter is that all of these cars have significant compromises. Unfortunately, they are not compromises that one expects in a car that costs 20-22 Lakhs OTR. I'd rather vote with my wallet and tell all the companies to go home with their current price structure and value offered regardless of segment. Sadly, that is an ideal world, and we don't live in a situation where such a scenario is possible. Skoda is making a fool of you by saying that 6 airbags can't be offered in the DSG variants at their current prices points. The use of cost cutting measure in ALL their cars is nothing but a testament to their arrogance, but, if you are on a tight budget or are unable/unwilling to get a BMW/Mercedes, what else is there? The Koreans offerings just aren't comfortable enough over long distances, or, the design philosophy is not everyones cuppa. The big Japanese players have given up on the Indian market, or are resting on decade old laurels. Isuzu is trying hard, but, like their brethren, their price structure leaves much to be desired. So, What Else is There? Subaru would be a great fit for the Indian environment, but we have not even had a whiff of an interest or promise other than a rebadged Chevy that I would love to get my hands on.

858, Behemoth , 19:18 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"So finally I got a chance to go and see the Kushaq in flesh today and also had a test drive of the car for around 10 min of the 1.0 TSI AT Style Variant. I also saw the Ambition variant parked in the showroom. So here is a quick summary of my observations: 1) The car is well designed in terms of exterior appearances and looks quite proportionate and imposing. Fit and Finish is top class and paint quality is also very good. 2) Sheet metal Body work done is thin and does flex a little when pressed - definitely thinner than the Laura I have and the Yeti I had. The Bonnet is also light and without any liner, looks quite Crude from Inside - The Bonnet of the Kushaq is lighter than the bonnet of the Sonet (which I found heavier than even Seltos's bonnet) 3) Exterior design wise, Skoda have been able to deliver a nice Modest design with subtle elegance which will be liked by many people. I specially liked the carbon Steel Colour and it looks quite elegant in this colour 4) Coming to interiors , this is where Skoda has gone on whole hog cost cutting mode and there are many areas where the cost cutting is extremely evident and makes the interiors look tacky and Cheap: a) Seats of both the Ambition Variant (Cloth ones) are absolutely pathetic and fabric is already wrinkled and looks like it will tear very soon (on a new car) For the Style Variant, it is poorly fitted cheap quality fake leather and it totally does not feel like it belongs on the inside of a Skoda. Even the Rapids in the showroom had 10 times better seats which looked rich and well fitted and the material was much more Durable. Skoda kind of expects everyone to buy their overpriced Seat Covers once they are available so that they can make some extra side money. b) The AC vents in the front are really tacky and plasticky like others have also noticed c) The Dash of the Style variant looks fine in design, but the glossy part is overbearing and kind of looks too eager to please and in your face - again not suiting the classic feel of Skoda's and VWs that existing owners are used to. In the Ambition variant it is a very dull silvery finish which is also not at all appealing. d) The Interior plastics are nothing great and in fact in many areas are more flimsy and lower in quality than the Rapid e) The Sunroof in the style variant has exposed mechanisms which simply look EEKY..! f) The Interiors overall may look ok in a sub 4m Segment car like a Brezza, but have no business in a 4+m SUV from Skoda - they are very un-Skoda Like and being an existing Skoda owner, they feel like a significant step down from the current interiors I have in my Laura as well as my Gen 1 Jeep Compass. In the Compass the Design may be very basic, but the plastic quality and fit finish are top notch. In the Kushaq, the design might be modern, but fit finish and plastic quality is definitely lacking. Now coming to the drive, I test drove the Kushaq 1.0 TSI AT for 10 min in mild traffic and also on the highway and accelerated to around 100kmph (did not go beyond that due to speed limits). The Kushaq feels ok in the 0-100 sprint, but my guess is it took over 13 sec even in sports mode and felt quite slow (maybe I am used to the torquey diesel engine of the Laura which feels very lively and has excellent in gear acceleration in 3rd gear) But to me the kushaq with 1.0 TSI AT version felt very lazy and slow. Even at low speeds, there is significant turbo spooling delay and the response time to accelerator inputs is quite slow and in many cases 2-2.5 secs! During my around 10 km drive, I found the mileage hovering in the range of 5-7kmpl and people who buy this car should be prepared for single digit mileage in city driving around 6-8 kmpl. Only if you have good highway driving at speeds of 70-80, will you get better numbers of around 12-14kmpl. Overall depending on your mix of city:highway driving, be prepared for an overall mileage of 10kmpl if you have 50:50. One big observation was on the AC - it was was 42 Degree Celsius in Gurgaon and even though the car was running continuously, the AC was not at all effective and it was not cooling the cabin enough - seems Skoda has again given the Kushaq an underpowered Compressor and coupled with a large Greenhouse, the AC will have a tough time chilling the car - this has been Skoda's continuous challenge - I had faced in our Yeti and still face it in our Laura - the AC is just not strong enough for Indian conditions and with the Kushaq they have done it again. Coupled with a small engine and a small capacity compressor, the AC system will not be able to cool the car effectively. Also, the AC vents size is pretty small and the air flow is very noisy and turbulent. I really feel that the AC will struggle to cool in places like Delhi/ Gurgaon. I don't know how the AC of the 1.5 TSI version is , but the AC of the 1.0 TSI version is definitely underpowered. Coming to the suspension, it is well tuned as expected and ride quality is pliant and comfortable. With the Ambition variant getting 16 Inch tyres, it should even be better than the Style variant. The steering is also light and well tuned, but in nature is unlike other SKoda's and VWs which have a direct feel - in the Kushaq it is too light and unengaging. Coming to the Boot space, I did the actual Measurements and here they are: As per my calculations, the boot space comes to around 336L + 8L niche on Left = 344L, which is decent and definitely larger than that of the Creta. So based on my Test drive and overall impression of the car, I have decided to stick with my Sonet booking for now - but if in the 4 months till delivery I still get a better option in the 15-25Lac price range with Diesel Auto, I will certainly consider it, but the Kushaq is just not the car for me, considering my daily running of 105 kms and also the lack of fit and finesse of interiors of the car. I will be waiting for some other options to be launched this year like the XUV 700 too. If Kia launches their 7 seater MPV based on Sonet with diesel Auto, I would be open for that too.", 7th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Gurgaon,"2,099","5,837",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

I could have gone for it but rear seat width was a deal-breaker for me. Thank you again. True, it depends a lot on the current car you drive and if you move from an NA engine to a small Turbo Petrol, you might still feel it as a jump up. But with me even the Laura has 250Nm torque right from 1700rpm and the in gear acceleration is just amazing. In 3rd gear it can go from 20kmph to almost 100kmph and in a way that very few cars can match. The engine -gearbox pairing (manual gearbox) is perfect. In the Kushaq first the turbo petrol has only 175Nm torque and then combined with a TC AT box, it felt quite laid back to me! In the Kushaq what I have heard is that the TSI 1.5 Manual is a hoot to drive and may be a good car for enthusiasts. That may be a good choice for many people willing to go for manual variants as that also has 6 airbags in the Style variant.", 8th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Gurgaon,"2,099","5,837",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Sure is a bit unfair on the 1.0 to be judged against larger, more powerful engines . The smaller TSI has a purpose which, I assume, it would be ideal for. Haven't driven the 1.0 on the Rapid or the Polo, much less the Kushaq. Am coming from a diesel Punto and wouldn't have considered a petrol (even a turbo) but for the Kushaq. My Punto, with its 1.3 MJD, is not a stonker on performance but I simply love the ride & handling package and the FE it gives me out on the highway. So, am curious to understand and would appreciate some thoughts here: a) Would the Manual 1.0 be enough of a leg-up over the AT in terms of access to power? The thing is, my first preference is the 1.0 MT not so much to save on the premium on the AT as for my love for manuals. My requirement, once we have the pandemic days behind us, is to use the vehicle mostly for longer road trips and hometown runs of about 500 Kms one way maybe 5-6 times annually. Driving within the city will mostly be limited. b) I would like to avoid spending the extra for the 1.5 MT, thought it may be better and more ideal for highway duty. Also, would like to understand the fuel efficiency figures for the MTs (both the 1.0 and the 1.5). There is the ACT in the 1.5 but doubt if it will help return better mileage against the 1.0. Anyone with a similar dilemma or can throw some light on the choice between these two manuals for a requirement which could be 70-30 in favour of highway driving? Driving style is not outright spirited but would, at least, like to get the kinda fun the Punto offers.", 8th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore,102,139,Body Exterior and Paint,Very Positive

As far as power is considered, it is pretty quick in rapid/vento/polo.

I will give this one a miss mainly because of 2 factors apart from horrible A.S.S. The first one, it's not a 5 seater. A short trip with 5 onboard is okay but occasionally I would need to accommodate 5th passengers for a longer duration and that won't be possible with this car. Secondly, the boot space is less. It will accommodate luggage for a weekend trip but any longer trip, especially if you have a small kid, some of the smaller luggage items would end up being carried in your lap. The price is definitely 1.5-2 L ex-showroom more that translates to 2L+ more OTR in Bengaluru. Cars in this segment are no longer value for money.

I would like to share my thoughts on this as it is a little contrasting to what I have read till now. I need 5-seater occupancy at times for longer journeys but the last two being 10-18 age kids. One of the highlights of this car for me is the three-point seatbelt for the fifth passenger. I hope that Kushaq will get some NCAP ratings by that time. For a firth passenger a few mm less comfort with a three-point seatbelt, in my eyes is far safer than a wide seat with lap belts. As long as the fifth passenger is a 10-15 years child I personally find this a big game-changer as they should be able to manage in the Kushaq seats. I see that almost all cars in India keep boasting about their focus on the fifth passenger while omitting this basic feature. The lack of three-point seat belt options beneath 20L was frustrating and Kushaq is the first car AFAIK. If we really plan long drives with five people, aren't three-point seat belts relevant?

The city has a 3 point belt for the middle passenger as well and is much much more comfortable to travel 3 abreast in the back, especially on long journeys.

Skoda has already compromised with its interior quality ( as per VAG standards ). Even Creta and Seltos do not provide all the features of each other. We already see pricing of Jeep Compass and Citroen C5 aircross with full feature list. Quote: A contradiction on your part, but nevertheless a true statement. I didn't mean to judge Koreans. They are providing a very good package that more than 90% of the buyers want. My point is that we shouldn't judge the VW/Skoda as well. Quote: Please explain us how do you conclude that? The Kushaq has not been crash tested yet and there is simply no scientific data to prove that it's more safer than the Koreans(and consequently more unsafe) Agree. No NCAP results so far. But when a Korean car is launched, you know it will be full of features. When a Honda / Toyota car is launched, you know it will be reliable. Similarly, when a VW/Skoda is launched, you know it will have better fit and finish, be safer and have better driving dynamics. Also as GTO had mentioned ( from reliable sources ), it will be 4 star. Although, Skoda do have disappointed with the interiors and with the 2 Airbags in AT version. But, I believe this will be corrected ( with subsequent price increase ). Quote: This is an Apples to Oranges comparison. The Polo is an entirely different car and competes with an entirely different set of cars as well.

I would still advise you to go test drive the Kushaq and Taigun and have an in depth look at both before coming to any sort of conclusion on how they feel or drive. Is it?

And if not sales then how do you expect a mass market manufacturer to churn out profits? VAG said they are just targeting 5% of the Indian market for now. Maybe in future they will try to be a mass market manufacturer in India. But not as of now. Quote: I am a VW owner and absolutely love my car to the bits. I had a very in depth, thorough look at the Kushaq yesterday and if there is one thing I can say, it's that it's a very watered down version in terms of quality compared to their previous cars. I am slightly disappointed as well and don't think it will be a proper replacement (let alone an upgrade) to my Vento. Agree, Kushaq does disappoints in terms of interior quality as compared to previous VAG cars. But, in terms of driving dynamics, it still is good. I am not saying that all ex-VW/Skoda owners will opt for it. But this is a major category of buyers who would opt for Taigun/Kushaq. Quote: Again, contradiction on your part. If you believe it will consistently do 5k units a month, then those cars will definitely not vanish into thin air right? Like I mentioned ""Not so common"". Even 1-2 years later, when you compare with number of Koreans on road, VW/Skoda will be the ""Not so common"" one.

I'm extremely confident that VAG can easily become the flag bearer of a feature list like nothing else but they just don't want to make an effort it seems.

Personally, I wouldn't get so worked up on a few handful of tweets and imagine a leading automobile brand is so thick headed to think an over simplistic ploy like this would actually create a buzz, much less generate sales. As NevGin pointed out, I tend to believe this to be the result of over zealous sales people getting shoppers at their showrooms to get on to Twitter and humour them with some charitable feedback. We see this all the time in hotels where the front office gets after you to log in/register on TripAdvisor and leave glowing reviews. It's not surprising to see many of them having joined TA just then. Let me hasten to add that I am NO Skoda fanboy. Just that I think this is much too much of a stupidity for any brand to risk something on these lines. If they have actually pulled this off, the Kushaq will be a much worse launch for this reason alone!!", 8th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore,102,139,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Let's get one thing very straight here. Neither me, nor Porsche_guy nor anybody else on this thread (barring very very selected few people who have been countered effectively) are coming to conclusions on this car without having a look at it or from the POV of a Skoda hater. If you look at the three to four notable initial impression reviews on this thread, Bhpian Behemoth owns a Laura and has owned a Skoda Yeti, Porsche_guy has owned a Vento and I own a Jetta. It's not that we are fanboys here belonging to other brands either. Lastly, the Kushaq has failed to live upto expectations. I put this as bluntly as possible, without caring whether it generates a positive or negative vibe. Both Porsche_guy and me are blunt and have a very keen eye for detail, but neither of us has been overly critical or biased in a negative manner towards the Kushaq. I see most if not all initial impressions on this thread having the same essence to them and I am glad. It's not teamBHPs job to sugar coat things, FB groups have done enough of it. I have praised the car where it deserved praises and criticised it where it was meant to be criticised. Coming to the addition of 6 airbags, I don't think Skoda is doing us a favour by adding 6 airbags. I am paying top money for the top end automatic variant of your car. The least I expect is that it has the exact same features as the manual which costs around 1.5L lesser. Finally, this car is overpriced. There's no two ways about it. It doesn't have the famed Skoda interior quality or the same hard wearing materials on even it's cheaper siblings, the turbo petrols have stiff competition from the Koreans as well now, it was anyways not going to set benchmarks for reliability and lastly, even with all the bragging about localisation, it's priced at a premium. They might as well have not localised it if they were looking to price it like this. As hard as this is to digest, the Kushaq is a good car, not a great car.

If you are the type of the driver who loves to accelerate and tries to extract a lot from 1.0, it will give you very poor FE. All small turbo petrols have this issue. Since you are not very keen on AT, my suggestion would be to get an MT and use the money saved to buy 1.5L engine. That will be a car for all seasons and for all types of drivers. Somewhat unintuitive but an enthusiastic driver will get better economy from 1.5L over 1.0L. As a bonus, you will get more refinement and stress free overtaking experience. If you want to buy an AT, you would want to think about the long term reliability of the DSG and might want to prefer 1.0 AT just to avoid the potential DSG issues. If you can afford warranty and potential repair expenses, then you must absolutely go for the 1.5+DSG - it will take your breath away. I think Skoda has done a good job of offering 1.0 with TC and 1.5 with DSG to give the choice of reliability vs fun-to-drive.

It delivers a tad more power on the Kushaq though - 5 bhp more i.e. - at 113 bhp. The peak torque's the same at 175 Nm. The gearbox options are also the same as on those cars (6-Speed automatic or manual). The idea was to build the engines locally to get economies of scale and drive the cost competitiveness back into the model's pricing. At idle the engine gives away its 3-pot status as you can a dull clatter. But that's pretty much almost the only time, otherwise I have to say the engineering team has done a great job! Great levels of refinement and engineering. Quote: Turbo lag is obvious between 1000-2000 rpm and you need to downshift using the paddles for an immediate surge Quote: The Kushaq is nice to drive and will feel modern and robust. Anyone worrying about whether a 1-litre engine can stand up proud in this compact SUV segment - may rest at ease - it does. But between around 1000 and 2000 RPM you can feel a little hesitation, and the engine's turbo lag is very evident. Some of that gets nicely compensated by the automatic gearbox I have to say. Between second and third gear, you will miss the punch too at times, depending on the speed or the response you are expecting. As a result, you do need to manually downshift using the paddles, or just kind of wait for the car to catch up to the performance you're looking for. That can be a little disconcerting. But otherwise, the level of refinement and performance that you get from this one litre engine is frankly pretty impressive.

906, Behemoth , 10:21 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Well to answer to some of the critics who thought that my comments on the car were critical: 1) many of these aspects like the seat covers are very easy fixes for Skoda and they should have done a proper check before releasing the cars to the public. Hopefully they will spend 3-4k more on the car seats and fix this quickly 2) on the Style AT variants not having 6 airbags, they must do this correction and at the same price offer it with 6 airbags - might be a hit of 30-40k additional to them, but it is essential for them to have the right kit 3) on the plastic quality these are gradual improvement actions which they will do anyway soon 4) the Ac Compressor is something that needs to be upgraded. But initial users will have to suffer an underperforming ac, until they get enough complaints and upgrade the ac compressor units for all. They had done the same thing for my Yeti as it also had an underpowered compressor. 5) the engine tuning is also something that can be fine tuned further on the Kushaq with better maps from factory and also for better efficiency Most of these aspects should be implementable from Skoda's side quickly and would feature on cars made say 3 months from now. So my recommendation to people who are really keen on the Kushaq is to hold off their purchase by 3 months and then but the improved cars which come in future lots.

907, 84.monsoon , 11:06 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"There is a lot of debate on this thread about the comfort of the fifth passenger in the rear seat of the Kushaq, as compared to other vehicles in the segment such as the Creta of the Seltos. While, I’m sure there will be some buyers who have a need to use the rear middle seat regularly, in our increasingly nuclear family set up, this is likely to be a smaller proportion. Most people are thinking about the relatively rare occasions where the fifth passenger may need to be seated and the comfort of knowing that the new car one buys will be able to accommodate this need, if and when it arises. Between two similarly sized cars, accommodating a fifth passenger in one, would require compromises on the comfort and safety of the two main seats in the rear. I have found that generally, cars that have a wider rear bench also tend to have a flat seat structure and thinner doors to maximise lateral room and surface contact area. The Ecosport versus Brezza is a good example. The Ecosport has very thick doors and so does not accommodate a third passenger in the rear. The contoured seats for the two rear lateral passengers in the Kushaq seem to be well bolstered and very supportive for long journeys or while travelling through winding or uneven roads, as compared to say the Creta. So the question is, would you rather have two rear passengers seated in comfort or have the same two passengers in relative discomfort every day, just in case a third passenger pops in for a trip or two, one fine day? I think we need to focus on the one question that does get ignored - i.e, how often does the third passenger travel in the rear seat of the car and is the constant relative discomfort for the regular passengers every day and acceptable penalty to pay for the occasional inconvenience for the third passenger?", 9th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Chennai,"2,220","9,796",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

The last thing anyone wants is an underperforming compressor causing more load on the engine. Could this is the the start to the first set of modifications we see on a Kushaq in the aftermarket. Redo the cushioning for the rear seat base and the back. Making them both flattish could help opening up some space on the sides as well as offering a little more comfort to the middle occupant. It might mean getting rid of the arm rest but I see that as very thin and flimsy anyway.

909, Behemoth , 11:27 ,Distinguished - BHPian," Quote: Originally Posted by NevGin This is terrible. Can you elaborate some more on this please. The last thing anyone wants is an underperforming compressor causing more load on the engine. Well let me try to explain this based on my experience with the Yeti earlier. Basically what Skoda uses in its compressors is a VRF (variable refrigerant flow) compressor in which the refrigerant flowing through the AC system is regulated by the Temperature sensors and the AC control module. There are two issues here which happen: The total compression volume of the compressor can vary from say 200cc in a small car and a large car may need compressors of 400-500cc volume but needs a lot more power from engine. A higher compressor cools the car better (like a larger Tonne rated AC). In the Kushaq, they have gone with the minimum viable size to reduce cost and also reduce the load on the engine - especially during engine idling - also they have reduced the Refrigerant flow even further at Idling to reduce load on engine and improve fuel efficiency. But the flip side of this approach is that at idle, the cooling is much lower and if you are stuck in traffic the cabin will start to heat up and become sweltry. However when the car gets moving it may become fine as the compressor speed increases and the refrigerant flow also increases. Also the cooling effect of ram air on the condenser also increases - so when moving the cooling might still be better. This was what I experienced in my Yeti too even when new and eventually Skoda did a recall within 6 months of launch for all buyers and replaced the compressor with a better design/ higher capacity one. After that the cooling was fine. But this has been a constant problem in previous Skoda cars and even my Laura still has lower cooling at Idling (by design) What other manufacturers do is use and electromagnetic clutch type Compressor which is much stronger and that cools the car better.

Not really, at least a Skoda Buyer considers safety as a key priority as these are not mass market cars from Maruti or Hyundai. But even in that segment people are becoming more aware. Airbags is an active safety feature which can save lives in case of accident and go beyond just what the Ncap ratings tell us. NCAP generally tests the lowest variants of cars to check minimum safety levels - higher spec variants with more airbags will score higher for most manufacturers but are rarely tested. A Skoda style 1.5TSI DSG buyer will definitely want 6 airbags when the 1.5 TSI manual gets it! The highest models will just not sell unless they do this.

Look at the sales figure of Seltos - still clocking 8-10K a month consistently... Well said. From an overall market point of view, it really does not make a difference. I honestly expected a dip in Seltos sales after the NCAP result whereas the reality is it had 'zero' effect. In fact there is a thread showing the Creta & Sonet structures has even less ultra high strength steel reinforcement (no UHSS at all in the Sonet) which logically makes it even less safe than the Seltos but again there is no impact on sales (even on the forum - and no disrespect to anyone's choice). Whether we like it or not, safety awareness might be growing but it's still early days to have a real impact on the ground. Having said this is still doesn't explain the omission of 6 airbags on the highest variants. Overall with all the comments here, it reminds me of the new Figo / Aspire with Ford. They tried to take the middle ground compromising the well know Ford build that people liked and didn't really stand out anywhere else which ended up exciting no one and the market reflected that. In this case, Skoda has set itself a very small target anyway (2.5k cars per month) which they will be able to achieve with this good but not great car. Quote: Originally Posted by Behemoth ...

Yes, but there are not too many Skoda buyers. Skoda is targeting the non-Skoda prospects and convert this Kushaq into a mass market hit. And I do not think the general public (mass market that Skoda targets) of India has reached that level (in terms of safety) where 2 vs. 6 airbags become a deal breaker for them. For us, definitely yes, it could be. But we, at the forum, are 0.000001% of the population of people actually shelling out the cash. Just ask any guy who buys a car with a 2 star rating OR one airbag OR NO airbags (before the govt. norms came into place) and they would tell you that the car will be driven primarily in the city, hence he is okay NOT having a safe car. We are a country where the general public protested against the government when they made ""wearing helmets mandatory while riding"" Ref: Pune. How do we expect these Skoda Execs to take us seriously and offer 6 airbags. Skoda execs are observing the trend of compact SUVs. They want to join the band wagon. Create a mass market product. A masala flick with lots of action and dancing that would skim 100 crores in the first week at the box office. Something that Kia and Hyundai did. They dont want to make a soul touching art film that would touch a few chords in your heart. Nope. Been there, done that - Laura, Superb, Octavia. Another example: You own a Jeep Compass which is personally, one of my favourite cars. But why does it only sell 500-700 copies (or less) a month despite being the car that it is? Nothing explains the omission of 6 airbags in the highest variant, to be honest. But my question is, now that they have made this blunder what motives the Skoda guys to rectify this error by spending additional money and lowering their margins.", 9th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Kolkata/NCR,"1,750","2,642",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

I was waiting for Kushaq since quite some time and in the meantime test drove the Seltos too among other cars and liked it. This car was on top of the backup options in case Kushaq messed up.

That, I feel is more of a demand supply issue than a lack for concern of safety.

Having said this is still doesn't explain the omission of 6 airbags on the highest variants. I would actually differ. I think the Nexon's increase in sales can be attributed partly to it's NCAP rating. In the case of the Seltos / Creta : there are literally no other viable options for a city friendly cross-over. The Harrier is there at a premium, as is the Compass. And on the other hand is the dated S-Cross (not tested), dated Duster (poor kit). In my opinion as buyers are becoming more aware, this is the time for companies to push safety as a brand trait. For example, Just the good performance of the Nexon, Tiago, Altroz etc. have led us to expect similar safety from the untested Harrier & Safari. Even the ever-slow to respond Honda has understood this with the very well equipped new City. Skoda always had some loyalists (me included) who valued their products for not only the typical characteristics, but safety as well.

That, I feel is more of a demand supply issue than a lack for concern of safety..... Exactly my point. Of course there will be the segment that will not compromise on the safety front, but it is too small for the OEM to care. Like you mentioned, there are many waiting in line, so the OEM does not have to react to something like the NCAP test because whatever they are able to produce is anyway being lapped up, so why bother with the re-engineering to address the issue. Coming to the Kushaq, I know it cannot be judged since there is no GNCAP rating as of now, but since all cars are not tested by GNCAP it may or may not get picked up up for a test. In such cases, I think we have to look at the overall culture / values of an OEM to make an estimation. When there was not even the basic crash requirement in India, the Polo scored a very respectable 4 stars as VW immediately reacted to the initial '0' star rating by making airbags standard on all variants of the Polo (they didn't have to but they still did it -- I know the same company is also behind diesel gate which goes against my point on values !) Considering the MQB is a much newer platform, it is highly unlikely that VW group would have taken a call to compromise the structural strength more so now that Tata & Renault have proven it can be done even on INR 5L cars. Yes, it's an assumption, but assuming that the car is equally unsafe till proven safe is also not the right way considering we have some history as a reference point.", 9th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Pune,"1,931","3,759",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

The car does look great from the outside, doesn't look compact from any of the sides. The seating positions was great, the hood being visible clearly to the end. In terms of size to price ratio, this car is definitely a competitor for segment's real King Creta and equally popular Seltos. The interior quality was definitely not top notch and issues like seat covers fitting, few plastics clearly felt flimsy and cheap, the foam strength(or density?) on the sides was really poor and it was flexing/compressing way too much on minimal contact. The dash seemed a bit small but ICE and AC controls are really well laid out, very flush and clean design. On the rear bench, it definitely is 4.5 seater, I'm 5' 10"" and on the middle seat my head was almost touching the roof. Although the leg room and minimal floor hump were fantastic. Boot space seemed marginally bigger than EcoSport, no complaints there. I was able to do get a short TD of 1.0L MT Style and the car felt really really nice. The cabin was superbly noise isolated. There is a significant turbo lag from 1000 to 2000 rpm but it felt less laggy than Venue/Sonet I had TD few months ago. TD wasn't long enough to comment on the AC concerns as mentioned in the forum. I have to take a decision between EcoSport Titanium Petrol vs Kushaq Active (or maybe, just maybe, Ambition if I do end up liking Kushaq enough). I have requested a home TD to check the car in my parking space, which fits EcoSport and needs some tweaks fit something like Creta. They said they will bring it home once deliveries are on and Active should also be on display in 3 days or so. On another note, the sales lady said the mileage is 15-16 kmpl in the city. Rapid 1.0 TSI owners tell her that apparently. On highway, it'll be 1-2 kmpl higher as per her knowledge. Service costs she mentioned 8-8.5K for first service, then 2-3K extra. She also said Skoda will launch a maintenance package for 30K for 4 years/60K Kms and that will cover all the service costs including labor. Does the car seem overpriced to me?

But initial users will have to suffer an underperforming ac, until they get enough complaints and upgrade the ac compressor units for all. They had done the same thing for my Yeti as it also had an underpowered compressor. 5) the engine tuning is also something that can be fine tuned further on the Kushaq with better maps from factory and also for better efficiency Most of these aspects should be implementable from Skoda's side quickly and would feature on cars made say 3 months from now. So my recommendation to people who are really keen on the Kushaq is to hold off their purchase by 3 months and then but the improved cars which come in future lots. The initial lot buyers may have issues which will cause inconvenience to buyers. Very well put together and thanks for detailing this. The major concern now is that who takes the hit? Even if they make these corrections within next few months from now then what happens to the early loyal buyers who have spent months of waiting for this car and now dissappointed because they are back to zero.

But seems like the value proposition of City challenges the expensive Kushaq. 3. Skoda brand : Like it or not, some get a high from the brand value. For me, this is not a factor. The bottom line is Kushaq will not be able to touch Kia or City on feature to feature comparison. It's a futile exercise. That's not its forte although its not a bare bone stripped naked car as well.

954, VeluM , 02:00 ,Senior - BHPian,"Walked in to a showroom today for a quick look at the Kushaq today. Ill just stick to the highlights other than mentioning that the rear seat is actually fantastic for two! Quality of the exterior is typical VW/Skoda, body and build isnt compromised. Quality of interiors is where costs have been cut, but still great for anyone not already experienced with the brand. As an existing Rapid owner, I can tell where costs are cut and it put my wife off to the extent that there is no discussion - hoping for Karoq now or saving for Kodiaq. IMHO there is a certain quality to older VW group vehicles on which Kushaq has compromised, but not unforgivably so. They havent compromised on the core platform, safety, or (from the review) chassis. I however do not feel that this is an easy 10 year car because the owner will be looking at the interiors more than the exterior.

Even the Rapids in the showroom had 10 times better seats which looked rich and well fitted and the material was much more Durable. Skoda kind of expects everyone to buy their overpriced Seat Covers once they are available so that they can make some extra side money. d) The Interior plastics are nothing great and in fact in many areas are more flimsy and lower in quality than the Rapid f) The Interiors overall may look ok in a sub 4m Segment car like a Brezza, but have no business in a 4+m SUV from Skoda - they are very un-Skoda Like and being an existing Skoda owner, they feel like a significant step down from the current interiors I have in my Laura as well as my Gen 1 Jeep Compass. In the Compass the Design may be very basic, but the plastic quality and fit finish are top notch. In the Kushaq, the design might be modern, but fit finish and plastic quality is definitely lacking. Finally, I did a test drive of Kushaq 1.0 AT. The drive was around 3-4 kms in traffic and couldn't go beyond 60 kmph. Background: I have a Honda Jazz from last 5 years and have driven Civic and Accord in the past. My quick observations on Kushaq: 1) Externally, it doesn't look like an SUV. It will easily get lost in the crowd, not a head turner at all 2) Internal space management is very good. Rear seat width is similar to other SUV in this segment. The issue for 5 people is the bucket design of the seat, but good for 4 people. Occasional 5 people should be OK 3) Ride quality is very good (typical Skoda), turbo lag around 1500-1800 rpm, beyond that it is fun to drive. Braking & suspension are excellent 4) Interiors felt Ok quality, at places felt flimsy than my Jazz. Nothing to feel WOW that we typically get when we see a Skoda Summary: I enjoyed the ride, but didn't feel anything great that will qualify as a upgrade for my Jazz. I will still wait for 1.5L variant and then decide. @Behemoth: I am aware that you own Compass Diesel. I am thinking of pre-owned Compass as well, I think in Blore they are available at 16-18L for 2018 Diesel MT.

Appreciate your comment You should consider that option too if you can get your hands on a good pre owned Compass. They are well built and the engine is a pretty good performer. The clutch has not hardened much in my four years and is still softer than my Laura. Do try out the second hand options you get and take a hands on feel of the car. The Jeep Compass is one of those cars from the school where cars were designed for an engineered life of 10 years/ 2 lac kms.

However, from the back it looks a size smaller than competition (much like Venue). The stance also seemed low. From the inside, I found the head room and leg room enough for all 5' 9"" of me, both at the front & the back. The back seat is perhaps the most comfortable in the segment for 2 people, things will get tight for three. The interiors may not be typical Skoda level but match or perhaps exceed the immediate competition in the segment. Visible screws in sunroof were a turn off. The seat & the steering in this display piece were better finished than what I saw in reviews. The dead pedal is a size too small. Till now remain committed to the idea of buying it as it has many more active safety features than Seltos in the under 15 lakh automatic segment.

992, 84.monsoon , 09:34 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"I am not sure why Skoda is delaying the announcement of the AT variants with 6 airbags. It makes sense to delay the launch of these top end trims for a week or two, to avoid sticker shock at the time of launch. Kia did this with the Seltos, launching the GTX plus variants about two weeks after the range was launched, since these top end variants were priced one lakh above the highest price is the range at time of launch. This helped position the Seltos in a comfortable price point in people’s minds, on the basis of initial impression at launch. This was quickly followed up with the launch of the top trims, which were positioned as being done “based on customer feedback”. It was well received by the market, as people did want a Diese Auto with all the bells and whistles and did not mind paying the premium. https://www.autocarindia.com/car-new...99-lakh-414061 However, this strategy will backfire if the launch of the top end varinant is delayed by a considerable length of time. In the case of the Kushaq, such a delay will form an impression in people’s minds that (a) Skoda does not care about safety as much as they claim to and/or (b) the full fledged product cannot be made due to some design or manufacturing constraints and cannot be had even if one is able to pay more and/or (c) Skoda has reserved such a complete product for VW (the parent company)‘s offering i.e., the Taigun. Such impressions, once formed, are hard to correct even if SKODA launches the top variant with six airbags in a few months time. The product has to be clearly, firmly and completely positioned when the customers are coming into the showrooms in droves and the interest in it is active, such as right now. The presence or absence of side and curtain airbags has absolutely nothing to do with the type of transmission the car comes with, mechanically speaking. Skoda is unnecessarily giving ground to competitors’ salesmen to malign it on one of Skoda’s most important competitive differentiators - safety, by making this totally illogical move at launch and not correcting it quickly.", 12th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Chennai,"2,220","9,796",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

997, ACe_10 , 12:57 ,BHPian,"I was near a Skoda showroom the other day and decided to drop by and take a quick look at the Kushaq. Got to see the Style variant and did a very short test drive of the MT. My observations are as follows: Style & Design As mentioned by many BHPians, the YouTube videos does not do the car justice and would strongly recommend checking out the car in person. The design is typical Skoda with clean lines, good quality paint job and no uneven panel gaps  it looks premium from the outside. The Kushaq looks especially good in red and should turn a few heads. The Kushaq however is not a SUV and, more importantly, does not bother pretending to be one. Its not even a crossover/pseudo SUV. This is not the car for you if you are looking for some street muscle. It does however look well proportioned (maybe a little short from the side view) and should age well. I personally prefer the non-SUV looks  I am one of those few individuals that felt that the S Cross (1st gen, without the BMW grille) was much better looking car than the Creta. Interiors This is where Skoda has gone a bit wrong  the car does not feel premium from the inside. That said, I would like to emphasize that the interiors are not a deal breaker or something that will turn you off completely. Its just that it could have been better packaged and feels like a missed opportunity. You dont feel like a king when you are sitting inside the car  you feel like a person who is on a budget and has had to make compromises. I am not too fussed about the hard plastics in general, but its an issue when the lower priced Rapid gets better plastic quality. The seat covers are a disappointment (especially in the Active and Ambition variant) and even in the Style variant the quality could have been better. If you are the king you certainly wont want to compromise on the quality of your throne. Again, these are not major issues in my view and can be fixed in the Monte Carlo/Onyx variant or in the aftermarket. The rear seats are very comfortable for 2 people. If rear seat knee room is a key factor for you then this car should definitely be on the top of your list. Headroom can be a bit of a concern for tall people though. However, the 5th person will always be an unwelcome guest in this car. Again, depending on your situation this may actually be an USP  I very rarely have 5 people in the car and would only look at it only in terms of comfort for 2 persons. That said, one concern for me is that the rear seat felt a bit gloomy and claustrophobic. It might be because it was late in the evening and the shades were up. I am no interior designer, but I felt that the all dark interiors make the car look even smaller  a bit of beige/cream colour would have definitely made the interiors bigger and livened it up. Something similar to what is provided in the Rapid, Octavia and the Kodiaq. Also, the plastics endings where the rear seat meets the door feels a bit weird. A bit of simply clever touch was needed to sort that out. However, on the positive, the front looks absolutely smashing. The layout of the dashboard, central console, two-spoke steering wheel (starting to really grow on me) and the instrument cluster looks significantly more upmarket than its rivals. Driving the MT I took a short 15 minute test drive of the MT within the city, but I was left impressed. This was the first time I have driven the 1.0 TSI and I can see why the engine is so highly rated. At low speeds, the refinement is absolutely amazing - it does not feel like a 3 cylinder engine. Maybe on the highway or at higher revs you will notice it but for regular city driving it is absolutely brilliant. I felt that Skoda has tuned this engine for city folks. The steering was light and perfectly suited for city driving. I can see enthusiast complaining about the limited feedback from the steering and (based on other reviews and not mine as I did not have the opportunity to cross 55-60 kph) not stiffing up at higher speed. But like I said, you will thank Skoda when you are trying to navigate, like me, Bangalore traffic every day. Downshifting to 1st gear is optional in this car, you can easily pull away from 2nd gear with very little jerks or vibrations. I also did not find any issue with the clutch and adjusted to it very quickly. It is light enough and ergonomically placed. The turbo kicks in around the 1800-2000 rpm, but you are never lacking for power or chugging the car. Again, I feel this is done keeping in mind Indian city conditions and FE concerns. The engine behaves like a NA engine at lower rpms  in neck to neck traffic, this will help you save fuel by not having the turbo kick in every time you move forwards. To get the best out of this car you will need to drive with a light foot  build up the RPMs gently and then slam the pedals once the turbo kicks in. I have a feeling the Taigun will be tuned for enthusiast  similar to the dynamic between Karoq and TRoc. Safety The decision to forego the 6 airbags for the top-end AT variants is absolutely mindboggling. This needs to be fixed sooner rather than later. Also, I dont understand why (as GTO mentioned) the target for this car should be a 4 star GNCAP rating. I wonder how much has to be stripped away from a 5 star Euro NCAP rated platform so that the MQB-AO-IN platform cannot even make the 5 star rating in GNCAP (a lower standard than the Euro NCAP), and why would you make that compromise when other Indian OEMs are providing 5 star rated car. I really hope not too many comprises have been made here  its important that there are viable option for safety conscious buyers in the market.", 12th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore,36,112,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

1002, wasywyg , 16:52 ,Newbie,"Went to see the new Kushaq. It really is evincing interest from customers and is definitely a looker from outside. I would say that it is compact compared to main competitors like Korean cousins, not necessarily a bad thing in metro cities. And that is what puts it in the same discussion as Sonet. Several people I talked to at the showroom were considering them as potential options. And these people were not ignorant about what Skoda offers. They were already quoting the ""ride quality"" and ""handling"" of Skoda but were still calculating the trade-offs based on cost and features. One of the things that did strike me was the showroom ambience. There was no sense of urgency. No one cared to even ask me what I was looking for. Most of the sales people were outside in the yard waiting for the single test drive car to return, talking in huddled groups. I checked the car inside and out, talked to fellow potential customers, realized no sales person was free/interested to engage with me and was out in 15 mins. Even Tata guys were able to spare a sales person when it was busy hours to discuss their car and offers. I don't want dealerships to fawn over me but do expect the courtesy of engagement.

A few things that I noticed, there was a mild vibration when I rested my hand on the armrest when the car was idling. I did not notice that vibration anywhere neither on the steering wheel or from any other parts. I would like to know if any of the other T-BHPians noticed this? Apart from that I felt both the IRVM and the ORVM did not provide the best of view. The IRVM's view was hampered by the headrests especially the middle one and the taper in the ORVM at the end seemed to me that it cut the view.

1006, VS1811 , 19:33 ,BHPian,"Visited Skoda showroom today and test drove Kushaq. My current ride is Seltos GT line and therefore direct comparison with the same; would try to remain as unbiased as I can. - Definitely a good looking car but isn't SUVish at all. Very clean, understated design and will age very gracefully but nothing that makes you want to keep staring at it. This one would be lost in a crowd. Size wise, could definitely say that it was half a size smaller than Koreans and reminded me of SCross a lot in terms of size and stance. - Paint quality is top notch and panel gaps are even. While Koreans are good in their own right, Kushaq felt better in terms of heft, precision and paint quality. - Step into the interiors and this is where things went downhill for me. I personally felt ingress and egress was not as comfortable as Seltos and the driving position was also not as commanding. - The biggest disappointment for me was the overall quality. In the Seltos model that I have, there is soft touch padding in almost all areas of touch like elbow pads on door, dashboard in front of the front passenger and likes. Everything just felt a bit worse than seltos. Stitching on the steering wheel felt less precise, gear knob felt more plasticky and hard, roof liner wasn't well screwed, seat fabric felt like it was done aftermarket and not company fit and definitely lacked quality. The overall interior ambience felt a notch down. - I sat inside 10 mins looking for 1 standout feature but couldn't find any inside the Kushaq. The aged MID made me appreciate the seltos 7 Inch MID even more. All in all, the interior ambience from the front did not feel great. - I am 6'1 for reference and seat height adjusted for my driving position, I could easily fit behind my seat. Talking strictly about seating comfort at behind, it felt better than Seltos primarily due to better under thigh support and marginally more leg room. However adding other factors such as reclinable rear seat of seltos, less claustrophobic experience and rear window curtains, overall rear seating experience might be better in Seltos. Ofcourse, 5 is just not an option in Kushaq, atleast for my family 😁 - Boot space felt good enough. I would assume you can get more stuff inside Kushaq keeping the parcel trays attached and vice versa after removing the parcel trays. Again, the rear seat fabric visible from the boot, the boot carpet and the string to pull the hatch down felt a little budget grade and Koreans are just ahead in terms of percieved quality and fit and finish. Also, Seltos does not require you to lift luggage off the boot and you can just slide the luggage off which I feel is quite helpful. - In terms of performance, a direct comparison with my GT line is quite pointless with the 1.0 TSI however we do have a Seltos IVT as well in the family which I've driven extensively so my comparison would be to the 1.5 NA of Seltos and it's quite straightforward comparison at that. Kushaq definitely feels the more exciting of the two, pulls stronger post the turbo lag and the engine just begs to be revved though the performance dies post 4,500-5,000 rpm. In comparison Seltos 1.5 feels much more docile, much more friendlier and less rewarding when pushed. There is hardly any turbo lag and it's a very gentle pull to the red line. While, it's not as exciting, I have a hunch that Seltos might be quicker to 100 as well as in gear timings due to no turbo lag. There is definite lag in Kushaq before power comes in thick and fast. Seltos is miles ahead in terms of engine refinement though. - Dynamically and handling wise, I wasn't really able to tell much difference compared to my Seltos. Seltos is definitely very sorted dynamically and has a really flat ride when at speed. This was very close to call for me. Where I could definitely make out the difference was the ride quality at low speed. While seltos feels a little choppy and crashes a little, Kushaq was extremely compliant and felt soft. Skoda definitely has found a great ride and handling balance here. Post the test drive, I was filled with even more hatred towards Kia for they came closest to a perfect car in my opinion. Well engineered, feature laden, looks good, dynamically sorted, good quality,all engines and transmission options BUT cut cost in terms of chassis strength. Have seen so many bhpians liking seltos but not going ahead due to the crash test rating. Hope Kia addresses it soon. Coming back to Kushaq, it felt just so unskoda like. It does everything well but just doesn't pull the heartstrings. It doesnt excel head and shoulders above the competition in any thing. There is a lack of USP here and for the price at which it has been launched, there ought to be more than one.

While, Im sure there will be some buyers who have a need to use the rear middle seat regularly, in our increasingly nuclear family set up, this is likely to be a smaller proportion. Most people are thinking about the relatively rare occasions where the fifth passenger may need to be seated and the comfort of knowing that the new car one buys will be able to accommodate this need, if and when it arises. So the question is, would you rather have two rear passengers seated in comfort or have the same two passengers in relative discomfort every day, just in case a third passenger pops in for a trip or two, one fine day? I think we need to focus on the one question that does get ignored - i.e, how often does the third passenger travel in the rear seat of the car and is the constant relative discomfort for the regular passengers every day and acceptable penalty to pay for the occasional inconvenience for the third passenger? +1 to this. I own Honda City for almost 5 years now and had 5 passengers only in 2 trips. Usually its just 2-3 passengers ( including the driver ). And the 5th passenger was skinny, so would fit in Kushaq as well. In my case, I would rather have 2 rear passengers sit comfortably rather than them in relative discomfort every day.

Rear seats gets bouncy in you hit uneven patch on road, and the rear passenger's head may hit the roof. I've got scoldings from my mom few times for this. The New city still has this problem from what I've read in few reviews. Kushaq doesn't. 2. Its longer than Kushaq by almost 200mm. You will have to consider parking space and U-turn in tight spaces. 3. Ground Clearance: I never felt the ground clearance issue except for once ( due to my mistake ). Of course, I don't drive it like an SUV but I would drive Kushaq in similar way. I am not sure if the ground clearance of the new City is same ( as 2016 model ) or not.

1013, KapilD , 08:13 ,BHPian,"I had a test drive of the 1.0 TSI Manual on Friday from Global KODA at Kolkata. The 1. The engine is pretty refined for a 3 pot 2. Loved the space at the back. 3. Boot is good. Dont know how its measured to less than 400 L. Its deep and usable. 4. Steering is light for city and the suspension is good 5. Clutch is soft and progressive. 6. Torque is good and can move from 2nd gear without stressing the engine from a stop go 7. The infotainment is smooth and the sound quality is decent. Also, wireless apple car works without lag. The map fills on the rectangular screen and gives a good view. 8. Seating positing can be easily found, no fumbling. So are the buttons which can be easily reached and used. The 1. Why the sunroof? I opened the sunroof and closed it working 0.5 seconds of opening. Its damn hot outside .. all the time and realised we arent a sunroof using country 2. The mechanicals of sunroof is not hidden, expected better finishing. 3. No one touch up and down features for all windows. I am spoilt for that convenience on my Polo GT TSI since 2014! 4. MID could have been colour. monochrome is too old! Although it has the required info. Dont know if they didnt want to distract the driver. Coz I test drove the Octavia 2021 after this and info galore on the instrument cluster has me taking eyes off the road for a whole second to see and set them while driving 5. Provision of dynamic parking guidelines and camera quality could have been better. 6. Its soft where the hands usually touch but if you go finding hard plastics there are a lot of them. It aint as per the usual VAG model car expectation. That said, I also tested the VW T Roc yesterday and boy! the quality of plastics seemed at par with Kushaq especially the doors! and a bit of the dash Bottom line: I own a Polo GT TSI 2014 model and was looking for an upgrade. Booked the T Roc but cancelled it after test driving the Kushaq. (Also the TD of Octavia had to do with it. My wife said why pay 22 lacs for such quality when you can get luxury for 26 lacs.) The driving dynamics are similar on the two cars, T Roc has an edge with a stiffer chassis but Kushaq is more compliant on Kolkata roads. I however feel that DSG smoothness cant be beaten and hence am waiting for the 1.5 TSI DSG for testing. It seems the ultimate choice will boil down to Kushaq vs Taigun based on the feature list of the better one.

Global supply chains and production is highly impacted both due to Covid and also the semiconductor (IC) Shortage. I can wait maximum till Nov 2021 for my Sonet's delivery but not beyond that.. So I am again in two minds and hence left with a Hobson's choice - the Kushaq. I will finally decide on which car to go for in Aug end and once the Taigun is also launched, probably will evaluate that too. Skoda has priced their Kushaq very smartly knowing that other companies are not able to supply the booked cars for months together. For a car that can be delivered in 15-20 days (or immediately) they will be able to get over a lac premium over other market offerings. The Kushaq is a well designed package, I just wish it was a bit better Executed one - which I hope it should become over a period of time.

It was a judicious call - in this context, one that made economic sense and was logical considering they decided to prioritise what the market wants. An additional 4 bags need not appeal to the average Indian car buyer the way it does to the average Team BHPian.

It was a cold decision based on market research.

And i ask this with full knowledge that privacy is a myth Congrats once again and wish you many memorable miles with this beauty Yes sadly privacy is a myth in India, you go for vaccination, they openly take your phone number, aadhaar number on a paper which already contains everyone else's number too.

I can also see vehicle speed , coolant temp, battery status, rpm meter on the home page of app. It also shows what is the last location of your vehicle before ignition gets off. Fencing is of two types, Geofencing(where you draw some surface on the map and if your vehicle cross that part, it should give you a notification in app), other is time fence(where you can put a range of dates with time and draw a path on map , and if vehicle cross that path with in the time you defined, it notifies again), I made some tests paths for geofencing as well as time fencing, will update once I move my vehicle outside of fence.

1050, T.S. , 23:09 ,BHPian,"Checked out the Kushaq today at the newly opened Skoda showroom (Mody Skoda, Andheri W), near my house. The car looks a tad smaller than its direct competitors. That being said, I loved the clean and elegant styling of it. Nothing looked overdone. One of the few cars that looks good is every color on offer. The doors had good amount of heft to them unlike what I experienced that of Seltos’s. The interiors are well appointed, and I felt at home pretty quick, except for the reverse stalks as I am coming from driving an Ertiga for 6 years. I am 6’1 for reference and was able to find a comfortable driving position leaving enough knee room behind my driving seat for another 6-footer to sit. Took a short test drive of the 1.0-liter manual, as the 1.5 was not available. It had a turbo lag till up to 1800 rpm I guess, something similar to my 1.3 diesel Ertiga. However not a deal breaker for me and the car was easy to drive in the city lanes. I will be waiting to test drive the 1.5 as thats what am looking for if to buy this car. I found the interior quality good and everything seemed to be put together to last for long, except for the scroll buttons on steering and ac vents stalks. The crude exposed mechanism of sunroof is an eyesore in an otherwise nicely put cabin. The deal breaker for me is the price for 1.5-liter manual on road Mumbai and the passenger space on offer. My requirement is for a 4+1 seater and I don't feel Kushaq would be able to accommodate 2 average sized adults and a healthy child at the back. The seat contours are such that the two on the side end up using some shoulder space of the middle seat and so any healthy child in the middle seat would not be comfortable seated specially for long journeys. Had test driven Seltos last year and the rear bench was more accommodative for 2+1 than that of Kushaq's. I will be trying the seating practically with my family in coming days and making a decision based on that.", 14th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Mumbai,79,97,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Just curious, have you considered Tata Nexon EV ( Electric )? Considering you are looking for a city only ride with approx 100+ kms daily. Well the comparison is bound to happen and the Sonet I booked was also 15.5 lacs on road and comparable to the Ambition model price on road. At that price the Sonet offers a much better torquey engine with an economy of 15-16 kmpl overall and a proper Torque converter gearbox. It also has full 6 airbags and other goodies like a sunroof, bose music system, ventilated seats etc which the Ambition variant of kushaq does not offer. Even in terms of space, it has only a little less leg room in rear seats compared to the kushaq, but the actual measured boot space of the Sonet is 30L larger than that of the Kushaq (actual measurements). So In every practical aspect it is comparable. Kia has done a very smart thing by Keeping the size under 4m to keep the taxes low while the Kushaq went over 4m and went into a higher tax bracket. In fact even if you compare the weights of the two vehicles they are very close (in fact diesel Sonet with At is a 100kg heavier than the kushaq with petrol AT) but we will finally come to know when these vehicles are crash tested. I am not at all a fan of Kia, but for my current requirements it is probably the best fit - the fact that it is not available for delivery for 6-7 months is another story and actually shows how overbooked they are. I have been a Skoda user and follower for over 10 years now, having had the Skoda Yeti and also the Laura (Diesel) even now. But with the Kushaq I was disappointed on three things: 1) lack of overall fit finish on simple things like seats and plastics 2) not offering 6 airbags in Style AT while giving in Style MT! 3) underpowered 1.0 TSI AT combo which did not feel exciting to drive. The 1.5 DSG would have been good, but DSG woes and also the price difference demanded is just unviable. At that price point the Jeep compass is very close and a better option (BTW I also have a Jeep Compass Diesel Manual) Anyway the story is not over yet and who knows there may be a climax yet to come!", 15th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Gurgaon,"2,099","5,837",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

1055, CrAzY dRiVeR , 09:50 ,Team-BHP Support,"Visited the Skoda showroom two days back to have a look at the Kushaq. This was my third visit to the showroom since the launch and was surprised to see the Kushaq finally available this time! May be because we went in the morning - but there was no crowd and thankfully we could take our time. Better half came along as well. Our first impressions as below - Exterior - + Handsome timeless design. + Looks the part in white (TD car), but the display car was in Orange didn't impress. + Small dimensions are a plus for me. Parking and U-turn requirements at hometown mean this is one of the largest vehicles we can look at! Sort of like a sub-4m vehicle with more length and legroom. + Wife never cared much for alloy wheels and all - but totally loved the ones on the Style variant. + She really liked the way it looked - especially the front end. ""Looks like a mini Harrier"" as per her - could be the split headlamp effect. - Looks small in the darker shades, and is small - especially when viewed front-on, and from the rear. XUV 3OO and Ecosport both has more road presence IMHO. - Has a Cross Polo feel from the sides, especially for the lower variants without the 17inch alloys. - 'Style' could have done with less chrome. - Paint quality felt good, but the choice of shades did not! She quickly dismissed the Carbon Steel shade (Rapid display car) and I hated the Orange. We really do not want another white car - so the only other choice seems to be red. Skoda, if you are reading - please introduce a black shade! Build Quality (not safety!) - + Good European feel, even if it is less than the earlier generation cars. Doors, boot, bonnet - all make their weight felt and closes with a decent ""thud"" too! Feels good that way. Wife was really impressed by this build quality - one thing she very much admires in our Punto and hates in our Xcent. Build Quality (Interior) - A lot has been said on the forum, and is true in person too! Interiors are a mixed bag - feels like Skoda was 65% there, but then decided to do serious cost cutting. So let me list out the positives and negatives. + Dashboard design and layers feel good. Really liked the generous use of piano black all over the cabin. + Headunit is well placed on the dashboard and feels adequate for the size of the car. + I really liked the seats for four. Both front and rear seats (nice bolstering especially for the rear bench) feel nice. Proper view of the bonnet too, which gives it an 'SUV' feel. + The two spoke steering wheel is absolutely brilliant in person (or may be my eyes got used to the missing spoke). Leather wrap feels lower quality and may not last the long run, but otherwise the steering feels straight out of the Octavia / Superb. Real feel good stuff. The display and TD car did not have wrinkled leather on the steering wheel, as previously seen in some pics (and even in the brochure for god's sake! ) + Textured plastic on the dashboard is good too! + Space for four is awesome. I'm genuinely surprised by the amount of legroom I had (despite reading the thread and seeing video reviews!), with the seat set to my driving position. + Lot of practical slots in the cabin for placing phones and bottles. One behind the front seats holds my phone perfectly. - Grey colour choice for the lower half is bad. Very bad IMHO. Reminds me of my Punto and not in a good way. Felt cheap in 2012, feels even cheaper in 2021. Black or beige, Skoda! She found it the main negative too. - Plastics on closer inspection feel sub-4m segment stuff. Except for the piano black finishes, almost everything else feels hard hatchback segment plastic. Especially hated the plastics to the right of the steering wheel, the a/c vent, carbon fibre type finish behind the door handles (which doesn't have a real texture unlike on the dashboard) etc. - Headroom at the rear is strictly average for my height (5'11"") though wife didn't mind it at all. But the view towards the front is restricted for both - no wonder there were complaints of claustrophobia. - Boot feels small when seen even in person, but useable and deep. The sub-woofer on the Style variant using up the wasted space inside the wheel wells is nice. Personally, I like this because the main culprit using up atleast 30% of the 280L boot space of my Punto was the sub-woofer. - Seat was not wrinkled in both the display and TD car - but can make out it is not a perfect fit. And that seat back design look like an aftermarket cover for an Alto / M800. Should have been a lot better! - Three point seatbelt for the middle passenger isn't even worth discussing - because this should be a four seater! XUV 3OO and Nexon will easily have a wider rear bench! The Drive - TD car was the 1.0 Style MT variant. + Biggest surprise in the package! My first experience with the 1.0 TSi and it really packs a punch! Loved the Hyundai 1.0 TGDi in cars like the Hyundai Aura - but the VW not only feels better, it does so in a much heavier car like the Kushaq! + Driveability off idle is decent, starts coming alive around 1500 - 1800rpm and the midrange feels really sweet. This engine is certainly one of the highlights of the Kushaq when compared against the NA petrol variants of cars like the Seltos, Creta or even the City. + Very light clutch feel, almost Hyundai like! May not miss that automatic that much! + Felt zippy for city/ring road speeds (Didn't do proper highway). Good visibility, good midrange power, somewhat light steering - all contribute to this. + Good positive gearshift feel. + Suspension felt like a great mix of ride and handling - and I could really see myself being at ease if this replaces the Punto for our 12 hour Bangalore - Trivandrum drives. - Three cylinder vibrations can be slightly felt at idle. Manages to conceal it afterwards. - Clutch took some getting used to! It is very light to use, but the biting point is vague and springy. Did roll back on me a bit when I thought I had finally managed to get an idea of the biting position. - Engine is audible inside the cabin above midrange rpms - I'd have expected less noise from a modern petrol motor, but thankfully it is an enjoyable sound for the driver. - Too bad this car doesn't get a diesel! The average stuff which may not matter - . Hated the pics of the latch for closing the boot door, still hate the design - but the material quality was impressive! Ok so may be it doesn't matter. . Didn't get to listen to the music quality as the HU was in 'Safe Mode' and needed a code to open. The showroom guys were not sure of it, yet. . Didn't care about the white analog dials inside the showroom or TD. It does the job. OVERALL Kushaq is a real heartache for me. It drives brilliantly and has an excellent set of engines to boot. This surely is one of the best enthusiast cars of 2021 - given even the enthusiast is into compact SUVs these days. But then for a serious buyer, he has to filter through a LONG list of negatives to see if this car can be a perfect fit for him. My initial impressions post the pricing announcement remain - this will not bring the expected numbers for Skoda and is unlikely to become a mass market favourite. Don’t need a diesel? Proceed. Don’t care for size / road presence? Proceed. Don’t need to fit a 5th passenger? Proceed. Don’t care about the pricing? Proceed. Don’t care about the obvious cost cutting despite the pricing? Proceed. Don’t care about the missing features despite the pricing and cost cutting? Proceed. Care more about safety than features? Proceed. Need an automatic? Rethink the above safety question. Wife absolutely loved the Kushaq. But will I get filtered through these parameters? Not sure. Multiple questions remain. Two years back I was 100% sure of the need for a diesel (Punto has run 2L kms in 9 years) but the pandemic and WFH situation has really put a brakes on the usage (Around 5-10k kms in the last two years). However, it may be better to hold till the pandemic is over, before going ahead with a purchase. Will I repent buying a petrol after a couple of years when the situation returns to normal? Is the Kushaq 1.5 MT Style worth 6 lakhs more than a better specced Sonet HTX Diesel AT / or more sensible Seltos HTK+ Diesel AT? And if the primary reason not to buy Kia is safety - can Skoda really be trusted, despite the obvious cost cutting, to have retained at least the chassis integrity of the MQB A0? Loads of decisions to make. A GNCAP result would have made decision making a whole lot easier. Some pictures - Not piano black as mentioned everywhere (including above ), but feels like a darker shade of Honda's Metallic Brown. Shines brown under the sunlight. Everyone complained about the a/c vents - but I felt that plastic behind the door handle even cheaper. It is not textured (like you can see on the dashboard) and has visible rough edges as can be seen here. Probably the best part of the cabin experience - the wheel looks nice in person. Loads of legroom with the front seat set to my position. However, look at the sad aftermarket style covers! Headroom is just about enough for my height. And also - The view towards the front is severely restricted. Sunblinds are part of the accessory package - The 1.0 has a large battery compartment tray with the battery occupying only half that space. Later when we caught the TD car on the road - v/s the Honda City Now, I have been a big critic of the 4th generation City - but really warmed up to the 5th generation, especially now with the big VFM against the Kushaq. Honda fixed many issues in the 4th gen facelift and the 5th looked like a brilliant product on paper! Honda has switched to cleaner styling for the exteriors as well as interiors and it is a photogenic car. So I dragged wife from the Skoda showroom to the Honda showroom to have a look at it - despite the 4.5m length making no sense given our parking constraints. End result - HUGE disappointment. Wife saw the dashboard, the plastic quality and the tincan effect of the metal body, especially bootlid (all of which felt decidedly cheap after seeing the Kushaq) and refused to even sit inside the cabin and check the car. The display car was dirty inside and ill maintained that she asked the sales rep if it was new or second hand. Showroom was large but without anyone around, and presented a sorry picture with all outdated cars like the Jazz, WRV and Amaze. We walked out without asking a test drive.

Sent my parents for a TD - they loved the cars but complained about the rear spacing with 3 adults/2adults + 1 kid with ISOFIX, which I also had doubts about. Finally I have decided to cancel my booking and have booked Nexon XZA+O after considering feedback from the family, especially from my pregnant wife (better to go with a 5 star GNCAP certified car than a non tested car with short rear width if we have to settle for 2 airbags). I have been following @Reinhard's threads for quite some time and thought Nexon would be a better choice for the time being. P.S. anyone knows how to cancel online booking for Kushaq?

1083, any23 , 17:57 ,BHPian,"Took a short TD of Kushaq 1.0 AT today. Exterior - the exterior fit and finish and looks were to the point, it’s a no nonsense design and will age well as in case of other VAG cars. Drive Dynamics - this is what you expect from VAG cars, sorted ride and handling, suspension setup is perfect, the cabin noise insulation is good, steering is perfect for city rides-light and good feedback, gearbox felt perfect. Interiors - this is where i think the designers missed the trick, the black and grey combination is a bit dull for a car that is so exciting from the outside, i really like the black and beige combination which is on my rapid. Though it is not a deal breaker for me, but the two potential buyers were of the view that the interior is dull and miss the bling factor which seltos offers, they were looking for disco lights which is their in seltos/creta, and other gizmos which the rivals offer. The plastics too are not comparable to ones that we see on Rapid/Polo/Vento but they are not deal breakers. Build quality - Build quality is good but i think it is not at par with Rapid/Polo/Vento league. Front seats - i liked the front seats very much they have good side bolsters and finding perfect driving position is no brainer- i find it difficult in my rapid. Rear seats - for two it’s just perfect, as you sit 3-4 inches away from the doors it makes you feel at home. As far as seating 3 adults is concerned they can be accommodated but then the people sitting at the sides have to sit on the side bolsters of the seat which will reduce the overall comfort. But i think it is not that you can’t adjust 3 people for short and in city drives, and as far as long drives are concerned 2 at the back is the magic number be it any car.

(13.52 seconds is the Thar Diesel Auto's 0-100 time) Thanks for sharing the numbers. The interesting thing to note here is that how superior the DSG is compared to the normal torque converter AT - the torque converter is almost 2 secs slower than the manual whereas the DSG is marginally quicker than the manual counterpart. Whether the reliability issues of the DSG outweigh the performance advantage or vice versa is something an individual has to decide. I have the Vento TSI with the same DSG gearbox and so far, it has been a delight to drive. In fact, the only reason I went for a decade-old Vento was that it was by far the most fun to drive AT in that price segment. It's a shame that Skoda didn't provide enough safety features on their most powerful variant. Having those safety features and slightly better interior quality could have made the Kushaq a very good driver oriented package in that segment (some missing features can be always ignored when compared to build/safety, dynamics and performance). I was expecting 9 secs or less which is similar to the VW TROC but good performance nevertheless.

It makes sense as the success of creta/seltos clearly shows there is no role of safety/airbags in making them segment leaders in terms of sales, there sales success clearly shows they have sensed the nerve of a common buyer who want a panoramic sunroof/disco lights/gizmos, and in a attempt to make their car look appealing in the interior front Skoda have used lot of shiny plastics which looks cheap. In case of older VAG cars we had textured and less shiny plastic which had a sense of elegance not bling. As far as my thought goes the car is a tastefully done car, none of the elements felt out of place, be it the AC vents. It is just the black and grey interior which was a real let down for me, as i sit in a black and beige interior and it gives me a feel of elegance.

There have been various comments saying they may have intentionally held up the feature so as to provide the same in a monte carlo edition but then the same could have been not provided in the MT version of style. Also, they could have kept the same gap between MT and AT version in ambition for the style variant and without removing anything since the only major difference between AT and MT would have been gearbox. Cost cutting doesn't make any sense because a person who is paying for the top variant will not hold of his purchase for maybe a marginal increase in ex showroom price for the 4 airbags. No wonder ambition variant is shown as the most booked version till date (%) This strategic misjudgement on Skodas part may result in major of the booking cancellations or sales drop in future.

1107, DragonHawk , 10:36 ,BHPian,"Took a TD of 1.0MT variant at Tafe access, Mangalore last weekend and it was a superb experience overall. Knowing Skoda dealers and being Kushaq a newly launched one, I had set my expectations a bit low, however to my surprise except for a couple of folks, the showroom was nearly empty. SA was assigned in few mins and got to spend nearly 2 hours checking the car which includes a fairly long 20kms TD. SA was only 7 months into the job except for a goof up on valet mode I was super impressed with his knowledge level. I have fairly little experience driving different kinds of cars. So my thoughts are basically from the experience of driving Ford`s for almost a decade. My TD route included full of dirt and potholes and a mix of highway and city driving conditions. So I think I am eligible enough to comment on few aspects of the car, particularly from my current steed Ecosport`s perspective. I felt the interior is definitely a premium one, although there are hard plastics everywhere the moment you step in you will feel the upmarket cabin experience. One quick observation though, unlike in Ecosport, you can`t change the ambient light colour in Kushaq. Overall cabin experience, fit and finish is definitely an upgrade. Coming to driving dynamics, I felt suspension is well sorted and unlike ecosport this one gallops uneven surfaces and bad roads with ease. I will exclude the handling part for now and I expecting to get a fairly long TD in my city this Friday, so I will reserve my comments until then. Now coming to the engine, it was my first drive with turbo petrol and having driven turbo diesel for more than 2 lakh km, I am always kind of uncomfortable to drive NA petrol but this one turned out to be a comfortable one to drive. As expected this one was eager to pull right from 1700rpm, the exhaust grunt you feel while upshifting is so addictive. The car just glides through speed breakers in 2nd gear without making any fuss. However, one thing I am eagerly looking to check is the car behaviour in fully loaded conditions in ghat sections. Overall I felt this can be a potential upgrade for Ecosport owners. Although Skoda`s infamous service and costlier spare parts are still a downer, the car ticks the right boxes for me to consider upgrading. But having owned Ford for almost a decade, I am just spoiled by Ford`s service quality and peace of mind. With Ford`s future in India is still in limbo, I will wait till I drive 1.5TSI to take a final call. For those who have booked, I see the essential accessories kit is priced at Rs 18799 and it includes the below items which I felt is an absolute rip off. My dealer informed me that they don`t have a price breakup of the items packaged as a part of the kit as Skoda is yet to provide the official accessories pricing, so as a result, they can`t sell it as a separate item.

Checked out the Kushaq one week back exactly as we’re looking to replace my dad’s 2015 Swift ZDI. The moment I stepped in the showroom I realized I was the only customer. There were 2 sales executives sitting idly doing nothing and they didn’t bother to escort and show me the vehicle around, instead assigned a new recruit who wasn’t well aware of the car and was extremely unprofessional, just because I’m 20 years old? That’s no way to do business Skoda. I also asked for TD of 1.0 AT but the vehicle wasn’t available and I’m yet to receive a call for the TD, on the other hand I was offered a TD for Sonet almost immediately and have also received calls regarding our decision from KIA twice in just one week. That’s how you sell Skoda learn now or you will regret later. Now on to the car, the build quality of the car is unmatched and I also happened to check out Sonet and Seltos on the same day on purpose to compare the build quality and I would say Kia and Hyundai are at 60% of what Skoda has to offer in terms of build. The exterior is neat and simple not blingy or over the top, simply understated. The panel gaps were consistent but the height of the car felt shorter even than the Sonet. Now coming to the interior, the Style variant is still good enough but the active and ambition variant were just to dull and bland. The dashboard had hard plastics all around, roof liners were loose and the AC vents were too cheap, one would fear they could fall off any moment. Space is good enough for 4 people and 1 kid. 5 adults is no go in this one. The boot space was just about enough.

Meanwhile, some more observations from the family, adding to my first impressions here - https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/offic...ml#post5101936 (Skoda Kushaq Review) + Music system is above average and will be good for 99% of users, but in its stock tuning - I felt its not enough to stop me from wanting an upgrade. Subwoofer does a decent job for a stock system - but the front components felt rather plain and without a defined soundstage. Among OE systems - I would rate MG's Infinity system and TATA's Harman systems higher than Skoda sound. Not all hype like Hyundai / Kia's Bose OE system though! PS: May be spending some time tuning it can yield better results. + Compact size is an advantage for me when reversing the car into the garage, along with a very tight U-turn. Good visibility all around, and the proper view of the bonnet helps too. + Parents did not complain of ingress / egress issues. Seat bench is set at a comfortable height to just walk in to the cabin. - ORVM is a full size smaller than expected. Had to strain my neck to get a proper view during the U-turn. - Doesn't help that the reversing camera is truly an eyesore! Should have been shown in lesser screen size atleast to avoid the blown up pixels. - Family echoed the opinion that the cabin quality felt more par for the course on a 15-17L INR car (1.0 Ambition and Style pricing), and does not offer you the feeling of sitting in a 20 - 22L car (1.5 Style MT & DSG pricing).

1125, drivingmelody , 22:44 ,BHPian,"This is the first post, but not a newbie. Been following the various forums and reviews on this site for the last few years. It all started with a very simple thought, Lets upgrade our Getz Prime GLS, Its reaching 15 years of ownership. Now, we have realized that it is not a simple task. We have narrowed down to modest list of requirements, after numerous visits to showrooms of multiple brands. For me, the topmost in the list is to have a proper automatic transmission, adequate driving dynamics and maximum available safety. For my son, it should be an SUV and for my wife its a good audio system. Kushaq 1.0 TSI AT and 1.5 TSI DSG seems to satisfy most of these requirements. Last Saturday evening, while we were returning from a short drive, we noticed the Skoda showroom was empty.(We do short drives in the outskirts of city on weekends at leisurely pace. Its almost meditative). All of us felt that Kushaq looks like an overall good package. My wife liked the interiors, she felt it is not overdone as in the case of few of its immediate competitors. Both rows of seats are comfortable and the space in the back is adequate for our family of three and occasionally five. We consciously cap our drives to four hundred KMs per day. Hope the hardness of the middle seat should not bother us on these occasional five passenger drives. (Three of our family members can fit in the back seat). Kushaq seems to tick most of our requirements. Holding of the decision till the launch of Taigun to see if we can get the elusive Six Air bags.

1128, rAijin_ , 15:02 ,BHPian,"I visited Skoda Showroom in Gurgaon last Sunday with Wife. I was surprised to know that there is only one Skoda Showroom in Gurgaon! The showroom was too crowded and a lot of people were waiting for the Test Drive. So didn't take any pics or TD. A little Background We were looking for a new ride in 2020. But after Covid, we didn't drive much in 2020 and 2021. We don't think we would be driving much even in year 2022. And there is no point in buying a new car to just have it parked. And we are still very happy with our Honda City. So, this gives us more than a year of time to finalize our next Car. Also our Son is just 1.5 yr old. So, we want him to grow up a little ( 2-3 yrs ) and acknowledge that we got a new Car. We would prefer a C-SUV since we need a better Ground Clearance. Although we didn't feel underbody scapping issue in Honda City much except for some speed breakers, the driving style is a major reason for that. A better ground clearance would give us more freedom. By late 2023 or early 2024, we'll also have options of more C-SUVs from Ford, Citroen and Toyota ( hopefully not a rebadged Maruti ). Lets see how these fare against our set of requirements. We are yet to decide between a SUV looking one or Crossover looking one. If we go for an SUV looking one, we would book a Tata Harrier. Also, if nothing else works, Tata Harrier it is. We checked out the Style Variant. Our observations are as below. We compared things more with our current Honda City ( 2016 Model ) and VW Polo that we owned 5 years back. Exterior:Me and my wife loved the shape and size of Kushaq. Just perfect to what we are looking for. A crossover styled C-SUV which is not ( un-necessarily ) botched up to look like an SUV. A lot of us have compared Kushaq with S-Cross. We personally felt it to be more like 1st Gen Creta. A little less in height though ( as compared to 1st Gen Creta ). Carbon Steel looked best ( for us ). Silver and White color looked great. Didn't quite like the Orange and Red one. Build quality felt a lot better than our Honda City. Wife was impressed with the heaviness on the doors and compared it to VW Polo. We also liked the alloy wheels design. Interior:The dashboard looked really good. the large piano black insert and carbon-fiber like detailing. We loved the position of floating touchscreen unit. It looks floated and doesn't intrude into the front view. Wife loved the two-spoked steering wheel. There were no wrinkles on the steering wheel. I'm more concerned with how practical ( and ergonomic ) it would be on longer drives. But still looks good. The front and rear seats have good bolstering ( and support ). The ride will be a lot comfortable for 4. 5th adult passenger will suffer even in short rides. Rear seat leg space felt better than even our Honda City. Sunroof felt similar to that of Honda City and we were happy with it. Apart from the above points, everything else on the interior completely disappointed. To make matter worse, we had a look at the Skoda Octavia's interior. Coming from a beige interior, the grey felt dull and claustrophobia even with the sunroof open. Didn't like the analog instruments. We would have preferred a digital cockpit. The fit and finish of interior was not at all good. The car seat covers must be changed. The plastics felt of cheap quality. The 3 pointed belt for the middle passenger at rear actually makes the passenger ( sitting behind driver ) uneasy. Conclusion: Although we are really happy with the shape, size and exterior looks of Kushaq, the interior is more of a disappointment. So, we would wait for the Taigun and see if its interiors are better than Kushaq's. Or if the rumored L&K or Monte Carlo variant of Kushaq. If not, we'll see if facelift version of Kushaq / Taigun solves these problems. v/s Kia Seltos. We also checked Kia Seltos after Kushaq. The impressions are as below:The exterior looks are more ( botched up ) to look like an SUV. But, we didn't dislike it. Although, I think Kia Seltos looks good, Wife is not that impressed. The exterior build quality is a big disappointment especially after Kushaq. I believe our Honda City has better build quality. Wife didn't like it a bit. Interior quality felt a lot better than Kushaq. The seats covers, plastic quality and the beige-black combination. We liked Kushaq's Dashboard over Seltos'. Especially, the placement of Touchscreen is better in Kushaq. Seltos has a slightly better feature list than Kushaq as per our requirements ( Digital Cockpit, 360 degree camera, HUD, front parking sensors ). Overall, Kushaq suits our requirements a lot better than Kia Seltos. But not the current Kushaq.

Actually, it is more of a dealership or the sales person problem. 5 years back, when I went to Ring Road Honda in Gurgaon, they seemed completely uninterested. Infact the sales person left us in between and attended another customer ( So rude !). This was probably because we arrived at the showroom in our Hyundai Eon and sales person thought we are just here for some AC.

To sum it up, If I have to upgrade today from my Elite i20, I have following observations. MG Hector / Harrier - Great products and some what value for money in terms of space they offer but tight parking spot in my parking and daily hassle to tackle a big car in city is something which has pushed me away from these two lovely products. Jeep Compass - Again excellent product but simply out of my budget, also may be a little overpriced. If it was like buying an iPhone and having a similar user experience the price would have been justified but I think with Jeep Compass the after sales experience is not upto that level. Kia Seltos - Feature rich and has all the tech and gizmos to attract a technology lover like me but they compromised on safety which is essential part of a car package Hyundai Creta - Again loaded to the brim and awesome looking interior but I can't buy a product which will not make me turn around and admire it, after parking it. Skoda Kushaq - A perfect looking crossover, with solid build quality and ok interiors, the only hiccup I have is with Skoda's after sales service, which is a hit and miss. All the packages offered by company for extended warranty andservice package do inspire some confidence, but i feel it is still a gamble.

Well your heart seems all set for the Compass but your head (budget) seems to be stopping you from getting it! In comparison to the Kushaq the Compass is a better car , in terms of Build, engine and interiors. Also when you get the Diesel engine, it will save you a lot of money in running cost compared to the 1.5Tsi engine. Let's say the Kushaq 1.5 TSI Style Manual would cost you almost 18.3 Lacs on road (Gurgaon example) The mileage you would get is around 9-10 kmpl in mixed used. A Compass Longitude (O) version will cost you 24 lacs on road. The Compass will give you a mileage of 14-15kmpl in mixed use (I get even higher now 16-17 as my highway:city use is 80:20 now). With this even if you cover just 1000km a month, the kushaq will cost you 10,000 Rs on fuel cost and the Compass will cost you around 6000 per month. You will save 4k in fuel costs, which means you can take a higher loan for the car and the emi difference can be paid from this The new Compass is a far more special car than the kushaq and it is from a different league and will feel more special when you drive it.", 23rd July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Gurgaon,"2,099","5,837",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

How is the reliability of Compass? These are things that crop up only after 5-6k kms I guess and very difficult to gauge from a TD. I get irritated with niggles like buttons not working, rattling sound etc. When I'm putting 30 big ones into something, I want it to be perfect at least for a good part of its younger years 3.

Absolutely agree with this statement. However, I would like to add that a drive isn't needed at all to feel this! Just step into both cabins back to back and the difference in quality levels are very very apparent. When you sit inside, Compass does feel like it belongs to a full segment above the Kushaq, for sure. For example - here is a sample of the interior quality inside a Compass Sport 1.4 (21L onroad here) (v/s the Kushaq 1.5 Style MT which is 19.82L onroad here), both shot by me last week. Compass offers less features in its lower variants, no doubt, but whatever it does offer - feels substantially better quality stuff to touch and use than the Kushaq!

It's firm but compliant enough not to get jarred around even on the 17"" rims + The 3 cylinder is a peach. Nothing much below 1800rpm, but above that it pulls nicely with a smile inducing 3 cylinder thrum + The driving position is nice, and the view out is much better than my Swift or Linea + Plenty of space at the back for a 6 footer with my driving position set for a 6 footer + Rear seat is also pretty comfortable with a nicely angled backrest + Lovely little fresh air intake tucked below the hood edge + Underbody is nice and clean with no wires and cables hanging around - Roof liner isn't the best and flexes easily when pressed - IMHO the dash looks busy and I think the main reason is just too many materials/textures/colors used. - All the creases and steps will be a nightmare to keep clean, and the dash on the TD car was already building up dirt around these edges - Quality the plastics may not be old school Skoda but were acceptable except for the window controls which looked cheaper than my first gen Swift, and shamefully not back-lit on a 16+ lakh car! - The quality of the leather on the seats could have been better as could the stitching. - Sliding my finger along the AC controls to control temperature or fan speed was irritating because it just wouldn't do what I wanted it to do - No underbody protection, not even an option one can buy! - Clutch bite point is very high and not very progressive. Could be a major issue on a slope for an inexperienced driver - Gearshifts are positive but it doesn't like to be hurried. Gears go into place a lot better with a double de-clutch or with a blip of the throttle Octavia L&K: + The Interiors look a lot better in person than in the pics. Its a nice cabin to sit in and the quality of all the touch points is good according to me. + The 190 bhp shows, and this car really gets up and hustles in S mode with or without the paddles. + Liked the digital instrument cluster - Unsettled ride compared to the Kushaq, which was also noticed by the sales executive. Checked onboard TPMS which said tyre pressure was OK! - Wasn't that silent at idle and under acceleration as I thought it would be. I could feel a tingling vibration in the steering wheel. My Tjet is quieter under launch, and my Swift has a better idle. - Auto hold works nicely in traffic, but one has to use a feather touch on the A pedal to disengage without a jerk. - The car has very little engine braking even when using the paddles aggressively - The stalks on the Kushaq felt better to use! The ones on the L&K moved around a lot more and it wasn't play - Hated the little gear toggle - I found the side bolstering of the backrest on the drivers seat intrusive, and I'm not big built.

On the interior quality, I remember seeing a few posts that said that Rapid has better plastics inside the cabin, that clearly didn't appear to be the case. It isn't as plush as the Octavia but I would say not even a deal breaker if you have set your sight on the car. For me who drives a 2012 Figo as on date, it looked even better! Tried sitting with three people on the rear bench - me, my wife & a sales lady. While both of us are marginally on the higher side of ideal BMI, the sales lady was on the thinner side. I am 5'9"" while my wife's is 5'5"". Things were not very comfortable but not very tight either. We had just about enough shoulder room. The knee room was excellent, headroom was good. The seat contours were causing problems from all seats though. On the driving front, with one lane demarcated for buses on Bangalore ORR, there isn't much space left to do or drive much. There was a turbo lag till 1800-1900, after which the car seemed to pull well. But did not feel as if the engine was really fast. The ride quality was very good and all the undulation on this road that we feel quite strongly in our Figo were absorbed rather well. The steering weighs up well at high speeds and inspires confidence. The bonnet is quite visible from the drivers seating position. The car does seem to have been built on a sturdy platform and one can feel it on the drive. The car also has a strong creep which should be of real help in the infamous Bangalore traffic. All in all, the 1.0 which we were eyeing still remains firmly in our consideration set. Considering both the engine and the gearbox are manufactured locally, I expect it to be easier to look after than 1.5 where both are perhaps imported.

About the looks, as I have previously mentioned, it looks classy, I like how beautifully they have done the back. I had a look at Jeep Compass longitude and really liked it, it is costing approx 24.5 lacs on road and kushaq is costing 17.5 lacks on road for the top end 1.0 TSI manual, I dont think paying 7 lacs more is something I can afford right now, and also its quite hard to convince my family that even after paying 7 lacs more, Jeep will still accommodate 5 people only I am the first car enthusiast in my family, so its hard to justify things you love about car.

Later on they replaced the compressor with a higher capacity one and also increased idle rpm by 50 (from 720 to 770) which could generate 4.5 degree grill temperature. But the Yeti had a 2 L diesel engine which had sufficient power. In case of the Kushaq with the 1L engine it may not have sufficient power at idling to run a higher capacity compressor.

In the afternoons, leaving the AC in Auto and Lo cools the car within no time and the AC cuts off in five minutes. In the evenings, it takes no time to get the cabin cooled. So far, I have loved how the car handles in the pothole filled roads of Mumbai. Did some short sprints on open roads late last night with 4 people on board and she pulls just as good As a one liter pot should pull. My friends who were with me and who own other CSUVs loved the NVH levels as well as the rear legroom. Android Auto worked like a charm with the Oneplus Nord 2 and I am very happy with Skoda Sound speakers. The sound system gives a very premium feel to the ears. Mine is the Ambition variant, so it doesn’t have the subwoofer, but the bass from the speakers is more than enough for my taste. I’m pretty disappointed in the rear camera quality cos I’ve seen much better ones in other cars in this price range, but it gets the job done. Active guidelines would have been a boon. Also, I wish there was a way the DRLs turn on when the car unlocks. And god knows what Skoda were thinking when they decided to go ahead with such small mirrors on the OVRM.

Hi Jish, While am not looking at buying the car now, I am in the market next year and Kushaq has been top of the list. Since the launch of the variants, this dilemma has been haunting me too. I am thinking of it in two ways: 1) Location & weather: Mumbai: Heat & humidity throughout the year. Thus, for me, ventilated seats can be a major benefit. Gurgaon/Delhi: extreme heat, though you still have some form of spring & autumn when its usually pleasant (based on my trip to hometown in NCR). I am guessing you'll also benefit from it, objectively. 2) Amount of driving: For me, I don't need a car for daily drive. atleast not based on current usage. This is a major factor on why am considering the extra 2L for ventilated seats (the major feature i see in Style). If you are driving daily, and have a good running, then maybe consider it as the benefit far outweights the cost (in my opinion). To be honest, if my usage is for daily drives, esp in Mumbai's crazy traffic, then I would not mind paying the extra 2L as I see the cost distributed over atleast 5 years (if not more) and that starts to make sense. Good luck mate, and keep us posted!", 30th July 2021,skoda-kushaq,Mumbai,95,222,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Agreed. They have already placed it at higher price point and only in limited trims. Right? My point is that such comments coming from Zac, even if he wants to promote 1.0L, may end up doing more harm than good overall. Why have 1.5L in the product to start with?

Well, all he said was his pick of the lot, and the reason for it. Nothing more than that which would go against the 1.5L or DSG. Working with Germans in the automotive sector, I have observed that they are very frank and stick to their opinion when it comes to making a choice. Same applies to many other Europeans and very much unlike Americans who like to passionately market their products and altering their personal opinion in favour of the product portfolio. So just because 1.5DSG is the top of the line variant, it doesnt mean Zac would have to say that its his favorite or thats the best. It can also be the other way around, where as I said he could have made that statement to favour their production plan. Hence, I dont find it unnatural for a person like him to state his favourite choice which neednt be the top of the line version no matter what the reason is.

If its for 6-7+ years , and if money is not really a problem. If its only about "" VFM"" , i would say its subjective. I had bought by Figo Exi in 2010. The top variant had Bluetooth and I felt whats the need when I can connect an AUX cable and listen to music. I had no real money issues. Turns out , I still miss foregoing a Bluetooth system in the Figo for a few thousands.. In the subsequent launches across car companies, Bluetooth became a given and I felt all the more handicapped. It dint have airbags too and each time I took my car on the highway, I wasn't fully confident of safety and hesitated crossing speed of 80-90. This has happened for 11 years now ! How do you put a price tag on that? Agreed Bluetooth and airbags weren't commonplace then but soon my car started looking dated. I would readily put a premium on factory fitted top of the line variant instead of after market hassle and fear of something going wrong. Affects resalebility too at times. I am not a big fan of aftermarket fitments as I have heard couple of stories from friends where they felt something amiss , even from reliable garages. So my take is if you really want a feature and going to keep the car for long, its worth it. For all you know, ventilated seats ( its only going to get hotter in the coming years!!) and Auto IRVM might be must have features couple of years down the line even in base models of CSUVs and that is when you rue your decisions. With new launches of other companies lined up, its a real possibility. The alloys are diamond cut and clearly differentiate this as the top variant. The rear LEDs look really cool in the videos I have seen. I feel its a big differentiator. No ? What about TPMS too? You might not need a sunroof but you never know when you might need one to be ""appreciated"". ""Wow ""sunroof ( a kid who sits in your car for the 1st time or someone who hasn't experienced it before like a relative / friend / colleague). What premium do you put on that feeling of pride ? Or the other way round - someone asking "" Why dint you get a sunroof ? "" ! A sunroof makes the cabin look roomier / less claustrophobic. You can keep it closed when you dont need it and forget about it. Choose the best of what ever is available if money is not a concern. A 12-13% increase in what you are shelling out is worth it if you want a feature / would need it in the future. Instead of justifying your "" logical "" purchase each time to your self. If the leatherette and chrome bothers you beyond a limit, its a different story. A stupid but important point : Not sure if it matters to you / your family but : A Style variant will give you understated bragging rights as well? Kaunsa variant liya hai aapne ?

We had a look at the vehicle and did a TD in Tafe Access ltd, HSR Layout in Bangalore. Wanted to know if any fellow BHPians have got any good deals from dealers. As of now, the SA is saying a big no-no on discounts, accessories etc. I had suggested him to go ahead with Kushaq instead of waiting for the Taigun as we comparatively the design language and the Service Network of Skoda is better than VW. Would like to know if VW will by any chance have a better build quality than Skoda given that both share the same platform. Any suggestions on it will help him finalise the car. PS: He booked a Magnite Top end CVT on Jan 1st, the delivery according to the dealer is on October. With recent news regarding dead battery issues with Magnite/Kiger twins and build quality of KIA/Hyundai exposed over few social media posts he was ready to spend ""relatively"" extra money to get this one. He is 6' 2"" and hence Honda City was not working out for him which I was strongly suggesting. So its either Kushaq/Taigun as the choices for getting a (well built) car between 15 to 20L is very few.

One of the biggest things going in favour of Kushaq vs Seltos is the perception of Kushaq being a better-built car and therefore safer than Seltos. On most of the other aspects important from family's perspective- interior quality - the feel of being in a more expensive car - Seltos scores more for me. Safety is the Achilles heel of Seltos for me. However, Skoda doesn't seem to be capitalizing on this - they haven't come out with any marketing messages highlighting the safety aspects of the car, leading me to think that probably Kushaq doesn't have the same safety standard, and we will see a repeat of Seltos story. (Hope I am proven wrong) The saving grace in case of Kushaq is the option to buy a fully kitted car even for the smaller engine - Seltos doesn't offer this. The performance engines are out of budget in either case.

Looks like you are putting more mind in the buying decision. Every product will have some pro's and con's, at the end it all boils down to your needs. If you will be using the car in 2+2 seating configuration then Kushaq is the choice, if 2+3 is the scenario most of the time then Seltos is the choice, this observation for rear seats is based on all the reviews available, but must be checked in person. I have seen both the cars physically and below are my few observations - Road presence (size) - Seltos Bling factor - Seltos Exterior Looks - Tie here as looks are subjective to ones taste - for me it's Kushaq(it will age well) Interior Dashboard - Kushaq Overall Interior - Seltos Drive dynamics - Kushaq Safety - Kushaq Rear Seat - Seltos(based on reviews) If I would have been in your shoes my only concern would have been rear seat. And as far as rear seats are concerned for long drives 2 occupants gives you best comfort be it any car. S-cross - I would consider this if saving money is my priority.

I visited or called pretty much all the backup options I had for Kushaq. Got an active response from one Honda showroom and that is where the interest lies as of now. The response from the others were so uninteresting that we thought of going back to Maruti and thus S-Cross and Ciaz too were added to the list even though Maruti was never in the race till now.Needless to say, they spoil us with followups and in a good way.

In your post, you have talked about three aspects: Safety Interior quality/premium feel Budget And you have talked about three cars: Seltos Kushaq S-Cross Based on your post, I would have considered both aspects (feature aspects and car/brand aspects) in the following manner: First of all shortlist the cars. Here it is easy to eliminate one car out of three. S-Cross is a very practical package that appeals to a person who is not looking for something special. It is an ordinary every day car compared to Seltos and Kushaq. Safety wise it is no less than Brezza which is a 4 star rated car. It has lots of space, a fuel efficient 1.5 petrol engine but has average NVH and has routine design of the dashboard that will not be anywhere near the cabin design of a Seltos. Thing is that you can not simply buy S-Cross if you are confused between SUVs such as Seltos and Kushaq and budget is a non issue. Now, between Seltos and Kushaq, interior quality definitely goes in favour of Seltos while Kushaq must be having a better build (disclaimer: I have not seen Kushaq in person as I live in a small city. I will check it out once I visit Chandigarh). Safety: Kushaq and S-Cross > Seltos Interior quality: Seltos > Kushaq > S-Cross Budget: S-Cross >> Kushaq > Seltos So, as I have already said, if budget is a non issue, then eliminate S-Cross and go for Seltos/Kushaq. Between Seltos and Kushaq, Kushaq is ahead of Seltos in two parameters out of three. So, my final choice would have been Kushaq (if budget no issue) or S-Cross (when budget is given a strong consideration).", 3rd August 2021,skoda-kushaq,CHD,"1,115","2,694",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Hoped that the Taigun presented a better option but its looks are hideous from the rear and may may not stand the test of time with the excessive chrome and those rear bulky and unappealing C lights. The Kushaq style model does need some after market additions to bring it upto par and thus wanted an opinion. 1. Electric ORVM’s are a must.

1245, Karthik Chandra , 13:35 ,BHPian,"Test drove the Kushaq along with a few BHPians post a meet. Kushaq looks very stylish and has good proportions. Though dimensions are smaller than competition it didn't feel cramped as such. Rear seat has good leg room and head room. Thigh support was sufficient for my height (5""11') and will be better for a person of avg height. Don't let the outer dimensions fool you, Kushaq has good rear seat leg room Boot space, though smaller is well designed to accommodate as much as one can in competition cars. 1.0 turbo certainly punches above it's weight. It has an aggressive power delivery (reviews mentioned the 1.5 TSI is more linear and this 1.0 is more fun to revv) Pick up is smooth and the TC is wonderful. Gear change isn't noticeable on smooth acceleration and perceptibly noticeable when driven hard. Should be great on the highways. Cabin quality is good and on par with competition but not to Skoda standard as people expect it to be. But nothing to find fault, be it dash layout, material quality or design. Only grouse is A/C controls are touch/slide operation and has no physical knobs. Steering wheel looks nice with knurled toggle switches. I like the 2 spoke design - looks premium. Steering is very light & slick at city speeds and nice to use. Need to take a highway TD to assess if it weighs up sufficiently (it should). Tried the tip tronic with paddles but couldn't enjoy due to traffic. It'll definitely be fun with paddles. If anyone wants a base variant then it's prudent to opt for Kushaq instead of Creta/Seltos since the active variant is pretty loaded and get ESP/TC as standard + turbo instead of NA. If one has budget for top spec then Creta/Seltos makes sense since its well loaded + Kushaq Style AT misses out on additional airbags which the MT gets 🤦🏻. Kushaq is likely to score better in the GNCAP and if it does then the choice is a no brainer. Until then the King remians with the pack. Good package by Skoda and the issue is for any non Skoda audience to take a look at Kushaq it needs to have the attractive features - Pano Sunroof, 360° cam and the likes.

1247, ZB86 , 15:16 ,BHPian,"I had gone for a walk earlier this week and I happen to see a brand new Silver Kushaq parked. The owner was standing outside, and I waited for a couple of mins to check out the car visually. He was very courteous and a nice chap, he was talking about his driving experience. He let me sit on the drivers seat to see how it feels. I am yet to drive it, but going by the comments on this thread and the person who owned it, I am sure it will not disappoint. The size feels perfect for a family of 2/3. The car feels robust and very sorted from outside. But it does feel a size smaller than Creta, Seltos when I sat in the rear seat.

1257, naveen.raju , 09:08 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Drove the 1.0 manual yesterday (we wanted to drive the AT but wasn't available). Some observations. This was after spending sometime with the Rapid and Octavia. Could observe the difference in quality (this being 95% localized). 1) It looked smart and compact. Reminded me of the Ecosport. I loved the exterior styling. 2) The skid plates looked cheap. 3) Nice looking alloys. 4) When I got inside, I could notice the issues. One grab handle was lying in the door pocket, the door pad plastics were scratched (also the texture was rough - sandpaper like). The air vent slider was so cheap that it wont last. 5) I could see a lot of exposed nuts/bolts/mechanism in the sun-roof. I haven't noticed this in other cars. I may be wrong here. 6) The head light control knob marking was twisted. Meaning the outer circles (the ones that had the marking) was rotating freely. 7) Like the HU. Couldn't find a lot of features but was smooth to use. Loved it. But was hard to find the volume button (got used to the knob). 8) AC was pretty nice and cooled the cabin really well. The seat ventilation was also good. The slider (touch) control wasn't really good though. 9) Typical Skoda instrument cluster. Wish they had a better MID graphics. Now for the driving bit: 1) The seating position was good an comfortable. 2) The clutch was super super light (blame the hard clutch of the Creta). But I didn't like the positioning. It always interfered with the dead pedal. 3) Was hard to believe it was the 1L engine. It just took off the line and overtakes were effortless. The engine was vocal in higher rpms but the sound was a bit sporty. 4) Noticed that engaging 2nd gear was a bit tricky. 2 out of 3 tries, it didn't slot properly for both me and my friend. 5) The horn was not the typical Skoda horn. It was similar to Toyota. Although it was fun to drive, the quality really let us down. I had a potential customer with me who is looking to add a petrol AT to his garage as a second car. Suddenly, the Rapid was making more sense.", 8th August 2021,skoda-kushaq,Cochin,"4,813","8,827","Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

The turbo spools up beautifully to make it feel naturally aspirated Drove a car with a DQ200 after many years. Comparing it to when I used to have the TSI and TDI, this seemed MUCH more sorted. Maybe because it was a spanking new car? But power delivery was excellently supported by the DQ200. Hit the pedal a little to down shift to check if there DQ200 still behaved like it had brain fog.

This variant will now be available for test drives at all Skoda dealerships across India. The Kushaq was launched on June 28, 2021. The crossover is available with two turbo-petrol engine options. These include a 1.0-litre, 3-cylinder TSI that makes 113 BHP and 178 Nm and a 1.5-litre, 4-cylinder TSI that puts out 148 BHP @ 5,000-6,000 rpm and 250 Nm @ 1,600-3,500 rpm. The latter gets Active Cylinder Technology (ACT), which automatically shuts down two cylinders when the engine load is low. The cylinder liners get a thin powder-coated layer of 0.15 mm. This is said to reduce internal friction and thermal load on the engine. While a 6-speed manual transmission is offered as standard, the 1.0L engine gets a 6-speed automatic option and the 1.5L motor comes with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox.

The vehicle reminds me of the Ford Fusion in terms of look and stance. The Fusion back in 2005 was way ahead of its time and was a beauty to drive with its 1.6l engine Coming to the Kushaq, a couple of things the sales rep told me about the 1.5 DSG trim 1. 2 air bags - which was pretty much known 2. No TPMS in the top DSG trim 3. Rain sensing wipers present While point 1 is known, i dint know about point 2 and 3. I am a bit taken aback by the lack of TPMS which seems to be a good safety feature to have. Any after market fit of TPMS will void the warranty and one would not want to void any warranty on the vehicle This seems to be the only downside as far as the vehicle is concerned. This will be our second vehicle probably standing next to the Storme which has been brilliant for the last 8 years now. Are there any options to have TPMS set up without voiding the warranty. If there is something, then i would most likely prefer the Kushaq. Ofcourse the Taigun is probably the other one to consider.

Overall the Drive was confidence inspiring. I never felt I was driving the car first time. Well manner and predictable behavior. You can control her easily. You dont feel the size as corner visibility / judgement is very good. Steering: Felt so nice to hold, precise, accurate & you can get the car where you want without any fuss. Only drawback was little weight with the steering, but not a Hyundai type. One can live with that. Otherwise no complain. Engine/gearbox: struggling in 1st gear, you need to revv little more to pick up her speed. Afterwards its a smooth sailing. No jerky moments during gear shifts. I am Not happy with downshifts though. Brake: Average feel, because its not a progressive one. Better than Maruti or Hyundai, but you need to press hard for a casual stop, light press of brake pedal does not help. Car is very eager to move ahead. Body control: Excellent. Minimum rolls, sorted behavior, suspension soaks up everything, will be great for city and highway drives. It will be a sure drivers delight. Interior: Beige lovers stay away, overall on darker side. Seats hold you in place nicely. Lot of leg room at rear and at front. But strictly a 4 seater. Small but very usable boot which is deep. AC worked very well. Average to poor rear view camera. Good music system, and I am not very much into those snazzy displays, which looked okay to me, but did not went into detailed check up of infotainment. Need to take your eyes off to adjust ac settings. Cooled seats was a boon (first time for me). You must drive the car once to satisfy your needs. I regularly drive X3, and I am not disappointed with Kushaqs driving dynamics. My wife is happy but I am worried about ASS and only 2 airbag even after paying a heft.

Now that we did the walkthrough today, the feedback was - ""It's a cute small car"".. definitely not a SUV. Next she felt this isn't even a worthy upgrade over our current 2017 i20 Asta model, from dimensions perspective. Boot was also a big turn off. I didn't feel like explaining to her how intelligently Skoda has made boot or how good fit and finish of car is and how powerful 1.5L Turbo engine would be..end of the day it doesn't seem to help me convince her or anyone else (whom I asked to wait for this car over last 6months).

Very true! I am still shocked at the pricing. While we watched global premier, with so many features from next to next segments, we were expecting it to be priced north of 20L ex-showroom. (Slightly discounted for being desi brand) But after price reveal, this car is now at top of my list. Mahindra has kept 1 lakh diff for variant jump and 50k for AT. For AX7 automatic, that makes it priced around 15+1+.5=16.5L. Assuming some features are made optional - add another 1 lakh (higher side), makes it priced around 17.5L ex-showroom, with a turbo petrol with almost double power compared to Korean and European siblings which sell top model at similar price. One thing is clear, Koreans and now Europeans have been charging way too much premium for lack of competition and that too will limited bling / creature comforts. Mahindra has pulled Jio in SUV segment. I am expecting waiting for Koreans and VAG will vanish. Tata will have to provide better interiors. Good times ahead for us who are planning to buy a new ride. This also makes the case for Skoda to bring - (1) Monte Carlo / L&K in Kushaq (2) Introduce Karoq as CKD and at a lower price point, hence leading to price reduction in Kushaq (make it leader in sub-compact crossovers category and not be lost for recognition in compact SUV segment).", 15th August 2021,skoda-kushaq,DNCR,359,957,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Make it clear that the odo should be within 5- 10 km of what you have noted during delivery. This will ensure your car is not used for test drive. 3.

So i can forgo this Accessory Kit - The only thing would be mud flaps, door mats and side curtains which are important. The rest can be got at a later time i think and from outside Insurance - I am getting an insurance quote from outside for 50k including GST. I will check if Skoda can match it, else i will pick it up from outside. The difference is about 15k I am planning to take the extended warranty 5/6 year and the Standard Maintenance Package for 4 years. I think it is prudent to go with it.

In case you missed it, in this post DBhpian Behemoth has clearly explained what might be the reason behind average AC performance in 1.0 TSI https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/offic...ml#post5097820 (Skoda Kushaq Review). During PDI, I did had an opportunity to do the joint PDI along with showroom staff and I did bring this up casually with one of a lead technician. Even though I couldn`t really get a convincing answer from him and but with 4 people onboard in a hot and humid coastal climate, it takes a considerate amount of time to cool the cabin. Overall I would say, it all depends on the climate at your place. I think for a cooler climate with less humidity, people might not notice it but for southern coastal climate, this will be ineffective. Having said that, AC performance in 1.5TSI is good but not the best if you compare it with Ford cars. But it is certainly not a deal-breaker. I did briefly consider Taigun for the looks and VW brand, but when the initial preview was out, with 1.5TSI MT missing out on 6 airbags and some essential features like ventilated seats, etc, all the euphoria died down.

I am not an expert in this field but still let me put my 2 cents here. 1.5TSI engine comes with APS-coated cylinder walls which ensures that the piston rings glide smoothly with low friction and little wear. APS or in simple terms plasma spray coating is not a new term, it has been in use in different industries for quite some time now. Quote: What would be the long term downsides?

Pardon my ignorance if this has been discussed before. I think it has to do with firing order more than anything else as improper firing order might lead to imbalance which in turn will affect the overall functioning. Having said that I remember reading an article which talks about this ""rotating"" cylinder deactivation on a multi-cylinder engine. This means that on a three-cylinder engine, either only cylinder 2 or cylinder 1 combined with cylinder 3 is switched off alternately. The result of this strategy is a uniform firing order, with each cylinder firing only every second engine cycle. This concept has also been investigated by Ford in the EcoBoost 1.0 three-cylinder engine but was not transferred to series production", 23rd August 2021,skoda-kushaq,KA21,509,"1,616",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

Deactivating cylinders does not mean those cylinders stop moving. It just means there is no combustion taking place in them. They are still moving just like normal along with the other ones which are fired. That means there won't be much of a difference when it comes to piston rings and cylinder walls etc.. Its probably the Valves, injectors and sparkplugs etc that wear unevenly. I don't know whether the ECU alternates between 1+3 and 2+4 cylinders when deactivating.

That's also the reason some people visually find the Polo/Vento trims better , though there are zilch soft materials there as well. And the minimalist dull dark grey (Skoda's attempt at Nordic chic) doesn't appeal to most Indians (me included). They should have gone either with the Black and beige (associated with all luxury Skoda's) , alcantara black (sportsline) or at least made the seat covers ice grey akin to erstwhile Seltos GTX plus or Jeep compass limited. The ice grey would have been the best option given that it matches with the door trim and rear console color. But hey , there's a thriving aftermarket for seat covers Sharing a couple of options I would go for , in a few months. Quick intervention by Skoda by introducing a new variant with these seats would dispel notions of 'built to a cost' imo.

Skoda's usually patchy long-term reliability, complex electronics and a suspect new tech are making me a bit uneasy. I would be more worried about carbon buildup around the intake valves more than anything else. It's an issue which has plagued many direct injection turbo petrols for years. In an MPFI, the petrol is directly injected into the intake. Since petrol has detergent properties, it cleans the carbon buildup around the intake valves before going into the combustion chamber and igniting. In a direct injection, the petrol is injected directly into the combustion chamber. This means there is a much greater chance of carbon buildup around the intake valves (not to forget the PCV system also has oil vapours routing into the intake manifold which can worsen this issue by forming a cake of carbon and oily deposit around the intake valves). End result, misfiring on cold starts and EPC. In the case of the 1.8 TSIs, the layer is so thick that no intake manifold cleaning sprays or Italian tuneup (anyways useless) can get rid of it. The entire intake manifold needs to be taken off and the valves need to be cleaned using walnut blasting. One way to prevent this is to use an oil catch can so that atleast the oil vapours containing carbon debris don't accelerate carbon buildup, but then warranty is compromised. The oil consumption issues have been sorted by changing the oil scraper ring design. I haven't heard of any Octavia 1.8 TSIs suffering from oil consumption issues. Another worry is the timing belt system. VAG is using a high tech timing belt for the 1.0 TSI atleast and optimistically says its sealed for life. I see this as planned obscelense. I am not trusting a rubber belt to last 8-10 years in any way. If it snaps (which it will do outside warranty around the 7 year mark), the owner is left in the lurch.

1375, JishD , 00:19 ,BHPian,"So after the horrendous stories all over TBhp of Kushaqs breaking down left right and center , I must say that , despite my optimism, I was worried taking it for a family trip from Gurgaon to Samode over the long weekend. Car performed flawlessly with 4+1 onboard and a sizeable amount of luggage. On the cobbled roads leading up to Samode Palace , ride quality was stiff, but there wasn't a single squeak or rattle (people who are complaining about this on the forum could have experienced an ill maintained TD car) . Hit horrendous traffic on the way back near Neemrana , and ended up having a bit of an offroader experience as we took village roads as part of a detour. A Scorpio and a Fortuner also took the same route. At some tricky places , both me (due to fear of bottoming out) and the Fortuner (probably due to lack of non existent road experience) were slowing down , but the Scorpio guy wasn't really bothered No wonder the hinterlands favour the Scorpio and Bolero so much ! FE wasn't anything to write home about at the end of the trip - but then it wasn't all smooth sailing, and we had idled close to 20 min while going , and 40 min while returning, while stuck in traffic. I tried cruise control, but couldn't keep it on for more than 5 min due to sheer volume of slow moving trucks across all lanes. Hardly any complaints otherwise - everyone thought the ride overall was very comfortable, not a glitch on the ICE, and the car performs really well at low triples. An ergonomic issue I faced with the 2 spoke steering wheel is related to the horn boss - if you try to apply the horn with your palm wrapped around, you will end up fouling with the paddles - they are just placed too close !", 31st August 2021,skoda-kushaq,Gurgaon,579,743,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative
1376, GTO , 09:04 ,Team-BHP Support,"Driving the Kushaq 1.5L DSG Automatic Having driven the Kushaq 1.5L MT & all the fun I had with it on the highway, I was looking forward to the 1.5L DSG as well. Called for the car in Bombay and spent some time with it. As you would’ve guessed, the engine + transmission are identical to the VW Taigun. The likes are as expected = fast shifting DSG, fantastic 1.5L motor, enjoyable performance, nice engine braking, well-tuned suspension. The dislikes too are as expected = DSG reliability woes, no AT with 6 airbags (terrible decision by Skoda) & the 1.5’s prominent boominess at high revs (gets annoying). Am also very concerned about the many breakdown reports of brand-new Kushaqs. Fast and effortless at any legal speed, this powertrain compliments the ride and handling characteristics of the car beautifully. The combo makes the Kushaq an effortless cross-country mile-muncher, if fuel prices aren’t a concern . Slot into D mode, take your foot off the brake pedal and the Kushaq DSG slowly creeps forward. This will be highly appreciated in heavy traffic conditions where you can drive with just the brake pedal. With a light foot, the gearbox moves up the ratios pretty quickly. Impressively, you won't feel these shifts as the transition is butter smooth. While the automatic transmission makes the Kushaq very easy to drive in the city, when crawling in slow traffic (1st - 3rd gears), you will experience a little jerkiness, which is a typical DSG trait. In the city, the 1.5 motor's healthy bottom end helps you get around effortlessly. Throttle response is good and the Kushaq rolls smoothly. Add to that, the direct-injection and turbocharger ensure that the engine isn't lethargic at any speed. There's always enough power on tap to accelerate or overtake quickly. Out on the highway is when things go from good to great! This is easily among the most fun-to-drive crossovers for 2 million bucks, whether with a DSG or the MT. You'll find yourself addicted to flooring the throttle whenever there's an empty stretch of road. Outright performance is excellent and the strong mid-range takes care of all the overtaking you need to do. Downshifts are quick (not as fast as upshifts though) and the gearbox responds well to throttle inputs. The 7th ratio gives the Kushaq DSG long legs on the highway. And touring you must do - this car is built for long road-trips. In summary, the 1.5 TSI DSG is a jewel of a combination that will keep you happy at low revs & high, and in the city as well as on the highway. Other than its reliability woes, this is one of the best AT gearboxes sold in India. I found the 1.5L TSI to be too boomy at high revs though. If you are continuously driving hard and / or in ‘S” mode, your passengers will complain about the prominent boominess. It is part motor, and part compromised insulation levels. The sound gets very annoying if you are driving aggressively for a longer duration. Tap the left paddle for a downshift and manual mode is engaged. The ECU blips the throttle to match the revs, and holds the gear till near the redline. This gets addictive, especially during overtakes! However, even in manual mode, the DSG will upshift above ~6,000 rpm and also downshift below ~1,000 rpm. We feel this is way too conservative - the MT revs to ~6600 rpm. Manual mode will also ignore wrong gear selections which put the engine out of the above rpm ranges. Long hold the paddles to revert back to auto mode. Cruising around in D mode, one won't even notice the gears being shifted. They are damn smooth. The kickdown response time is quick enough and you will never feel that the gearbox is hunting for gears either. It's in the right ratio almost all the time. When you are in the mood to drive the car aggressively, engage Sport mode. In S, the gearbox downshifts to keep the car in the power band, holds the ratios longer and lets the punchy midrange do all the heavy lifting required. But in ""S"" mode, the boominess is more obvious (due to the higher rpm levels). Out on the open road, you will find it hard to resist the urge to go hard on the throttle. The Kushaq is simply brilliant to drive! On the flip side, we have scarily serious concerns over the DSG's long-term reliability. Just search on Team-BHP and you will see story after story of DQ200 failures & breakdowns. Skoda insists they have fixed the problem, but we aren't convinced at all. This gearbox has inherent design defects IMHO. Some BHPians who can't resist the DSG have mentally relegated themselves to 2 breakdowns over 8 - 10 years of ownership. If reliability is your topmost criteria, you should pick the 1.0 with a torque-converter AT, or consider another car model altogether.", 31st August 2021,skoda-kushaq,Bombay,"70,236","298,017",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

1379, androdev , 10:20 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Have finally test driven Kushaq 1.5 DSG. Asked the sales person if I can drive it in full josh. He said it would be no problem as long as there are no speed cameras. Fair enough. I was very excited because this is the cheapest VW car with DSG + Paddle Shifters offering 6 years of warranty. Let's get some banter talking points out of the way. The car looks smart. Design is pleasing inside out. VW-ness is retained. Yeah, it is no Octavia but you are reminded of that fact in a respectably subtle way. The driver is well covered - whatever he/she sees and feels (steering, visibility, general controls, etc.) is of good quality and aesthetically pleasing. You will not feel like you got a great deal for your money but it will surely meet your objective of driving a typical VW/Skoda car with its typical build, ride and finesse. Grey + black is an unusual choice for India, I guess they were trying to break away from the beige. Ever since I drove the Polo DSG when it was launched, I have been hoping for VW to do justice to DSG at a lower price. Polo GTI was too niche, too expensive and too impractical. Reasonably powerful engine in compact car, DSG with paddle shifters + 6yr warranty for the driver along with usual by-products like space and convenience features for the passengers so you can get the green light to buy it. Unfortunately, that has not happened. Given that I am disappointed, I don't have a lot of energy to write a compelling review of the drive. I will resort to the lazy bullet-point format to pass on the important observations: 1. DSG is phenomenal but it has not got a competent engine partner. The engine is noisy and gives you the feeling that it is not too happy to rev. This is a bummer - because the dreaded DSG is loved just for the single trait of holding the gear till the engine revs to redline and slamming a lightning quick shift. The engine builds up revs quickly and gets to redline but that noise is not pleasant. For comparison, Honda City 1.5 sounds great as it revs to redline. 2. Hard braking experience is not great. Ignoring the engine noise, this car is a rocket and gains speeds very rapidly. If you slam the brakes while at a good speed, it doesn't give you that ""planted"" feel. Lack of rear brakes, high GC (not sure about the tires and pressure) must be contributing factors. This is why I am never a fan of crossovers - they go fast like sedans but can't handle emergency situations like sedans. 3. I am guessing the speed chimes (80, 120kmph) can be disabled - absolutely unnerving. Just these three aspects totally disqualified this car from being a contender. Chimes can be disabled I guess. I might get to like or live with engine noise (it is responsive and powerful). High speed braking was a total deal breaker - I think it has more to do with it not being a sedan than rear drum brakes. I have also test driven the Superb while I was there, just to see how a 2L engine performs in comparison. I hated that virtual display and constant changing of information and suggestions to change gears and all that rubbish. I just wanted to see the damn tacho and time my gear shifts - I hope they have a setting where the display can be set to strict analogue mode. The engine is way too powerful to redline on city roads, which is why I felt disappointed about Kushaq DSG. It has got just the right amount of power to enjoy a petrol+DSG combination without going dangerously fast. Kushaq 1.0 MT and conventional AT are the cars to buy: No DSG headache. Brakes and chassis can handle 1.0 power. This is a great practical city car - good looking, pleasant aesthetics, spacious, sorted ride and contemporary features, etc. Kushaq 1.5: I feel you will get into trouble if you drive at the limits - the brakes and chassis don't seem upto the challenge. Kushaq 1.5 DSG: The commitment warranted by the DSG is a bit too much given the driving pleasure on offer. My key take away is not to ever consider a crossover again and stick to hatchbacks and sedans. That would put pre-owned Polo DSG (add a steering with paddle shifters) and Octavia DSG above Kushaq DSG.", 1st September 2021,skoda-kushaq,bangalore,"3,080","21,714","Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

The plastics will hold but they are not premium soft-touch plastics one sees in cars like Octavia etc. This is a result of their so called localisation. For most cars beyond 10 years of age, the problem is not with materials but with rattles and squeaks. This depends on the type of roads and the abuse the car sees - our Indian roads will make even a Rolls Royce rattle in 10 years. I haven't checked corners but no body roll while you weave through traffic at high speeds even under pedal to metal mode. Steering is on the lighter side, but perfectly predictable and enjoyable. My issue was with hard braking and while it was adequate, I didn't like it. I don't think anyone with 2L km in mind should consider a VW. Manual transmission will last but will lose its smooth operation. AT box on 1.0 will last the distance and will remain smooth, which is why it is my top recommendation from the list of variants. I don't think TSI motor can last 2L km without issues. I didn't pay attention to AC due to lovely Bangalore weather these days. The air-flow was freezing my fingers on the steering so I had to tilt the vents up - I could conclude two things. AC is cold enough even at silent blower speed and the plastics vents are not ugly enough to catch my attention. No errors other than annoying speed beeps. I drove it only to test the DSG+Engine combination and it was on new airport road (Jakkur Bangalore PPS showroom) and it was completely pedal-to-metal and hard-braking mode. Decent amount of traffic and fast roads - ideal conditions to test. Had the engine revved without noise and the hard-braking were confidence inspiring, this would have been a phenomenal car. One could argue that not everyone would be driving at the limits but then why pay extra for 1.5+DSG when a more sensible 1.0 AT exists.", 1st September 2021,skoda-kushaq,bangalore,"3,080","21,714",All-Wheel/4-Wheel Drive,Very Positive

On what basis do you expect the bumper to tear out for most Indian cars? The first and foremost thing to look at is the nature and shape of the other object which was involved in this collision. In this case, it looks like a side swipe going by the shape of the damage and not an impact. Also by the sharp lines, it looks like a bullock cart with a metal frame or the metal arm that goes onto the bulls. Either of it has come in contact with the sheet metal. Now the bullock cart is not at the bumper level, hence the bumper is saved. This is irrespective of the car obviously. Coming to the rest of the damage, it is natural for the sheet metal to get ripped off when there is a side swipe with say the end of a metal rod or the corner of a metallic frame.

1391, agambhandari , 15:06 ,BANNED,"I recently took a Test Drive of the 1.5 TSI DSG as I was interested to see how the Kushaq drives and how good is this engine gearbox combination. Background: I have 1.2 TSI DSG Polo(with some mods) as my daily driver and my parents use a current gen X1 which I drive from time to time. We have also had an Ecosport Ecoboost in the past. So my comparisons would be made w.r.t these cars Build Quality For exteriors is top notch, usual VAG quality. For interiors, I feel it is on par with Polo/Vento Segment with it being better at some places but worse at others. The weight and solid feeling of a VAG car is definitely still there. Space inside is brilliant, I would say very close to the X1 and much better than Seltos/creta thanks to the longer wheelbase. I had more than enough space at the backseat trying to sit behind the driver's seat set for myself at 5' 11"". Width is definitely not enough for comfortable 3 seating but I don't think any car in this segment is genuinely comfortable for this. Engine and Gearbox: 1.5 TSI is very smooth , i would say half a level better than 1.2 in terms of refinement and WAY better than the 1.0 TSI that i have tried in Polo/Rapid. But as an enthusiast, I didn't find that ""kick"" that the 1.0 and even the old 1.2 had. In terms of pure speed, yes the 1.5 Kushaq might be a bit faster than say a 1.0 polo , but it doesn't feel like it. After getting a remap on my 1.2, i found the kick to be even better. So I would think the tuning on the 1.5 has been kept conservative and probably they offer a more souped version in a monte carlo version or maybe the upcoming Sedan. The Gearbox though works very well as usual and paddles are a joy to use. Ride and Handling The Ride quality is nearly perfect and it handles broken roads like a boss. It is infinitely more comfortable than a polo/rapid on city roads and imperfections, very close to X1. BUT, this comes at the cost of handling. The steering is lifeless and has absolutely no feel. It is ""video game"" light at almost all speeds and this is probably a good thing for the target demographic. In comparison, Polo's steering is a bit heavier and feels noticeably better from an Enthusiast's perspective. I would suggest if Skoda/VW can offer drive modes to somehow give an option to weigh up the steering. Maybe getting wider tyres would help in this. BTW, all media cars had Goodyear Triplemaxx but I saw some cars at the dealer having MRF Wanderers And as for handling, it is sure footed but nowhere near as composed as Polo. (I may be biased and the comparison might be a bit unfair as I am running a sway bar upgrade on Polo). There is a good amount of body roll and it is noticeable if you are coming from anything better. X1 drives so much like a small hatch in the sense that there is hardly any roll, so I was expecting Kushaq to be close to that. Conclusions In many ways Kushaq is exactly what Polo and Rapid aren't. It is comfortable, easy to drive, spacious, has good ride quality and really good features as well. But it does not appeal to the enthusiast in me. It is squarely aimed at a more mature buyer who is looking for a more comfortable option. I was expecting a bigger, faster fun to drive polo but the drive back home in my polo has made it clear that Polo is still way more fun to drive (Even though not as practical) P.S. This drive has also brought a newfound respect for the luxury crossover segment. When you drive an X1 or GLA, they drive very much like a small hatch in that they are nimble, easy to place and it is very easy to dismiss them for being overpriced glorified hatches. But driving the Kushaq (and earlier Seltos) has clearly showed that it takes work and engineering to make these highly sprung cars to drive like they are low slung.

For interiors: Kushaq is definitely better by a good margin Ride quality: Kushaq wins by a mile and a half. Ecosport (especially prefacelift) had very harsh ride quality and not at all comfortable at slower speeds Handling: Ecosport wins hands down. The steering was light as well but felt more precise, quicker and there was lesser body roll as well.

I believe this is a perfect upgrade for Ecosport owners if driving pleasure is not your priority. I would again emphasise, probably there is more fun to be had by tuning and modding this car.

Kushaq is not a first car someone would buy, generally. The typical buyer already owned a hatchback or sedan or a CSUV before and is upgrading. So they likely have decent driving experience.

1423, mayankverma , 15:04 ,BHPian,"We visited Brite Skoda, Noida last Sunday for checking out Kushaq and get a test drive. Looking to replace our old workhorse Zest. I will share few of my initial impressions about the vehicle: 1. 1L TSI engine is punchy at lower gears and lag is minimum. Power felt adequate for city with 5 on-board. Need to take a longer drive on an open road to comment on highway performance 2. MT gear shift was smooth and clutch was light and short. Brakes were responsive 3. Overall build quality is satisfactory(does not feel very premium, except the dashboard to an extent) 4. Sunroof size is ok (although we not big fan) 5. Dashboard layout feels upmarket(I feel the design & overall feel is the best out of the competition) and 2-spoke steering feels good to hold 6. Centre Infotainment touch panel is nice to use and responsive. Other touch controls also felt responsive. Auto A/C cooling felt satisfactory, although it was not a very hot day so cant judge much. There was a slight whistling sound coming from the A/C outlets at high fan speed, couldnt find the reason from SA 7. Front & Rear Seats felt comfortable, even though I felt the front driver seats height adjustment range is limited(I like to ride as high as possible). Steering was tilt and reach adjustable 8. Rear legroom is good! My wife sitting at the back claimed its the most legroom she has experienced compared to other cars in the segment 9. Boot space, even though it is deep, felt a size smaller than direct competitors. It felt only marginally bigger than my Zest. Will have to stack those big suitcases on top of each other 10. Wife really liked the Tornado Red colour(its really bright!!), I thought it looked good in white and carbon steel as well As per the feature list and OTR price of ~14.7 L, we felt that Ambition MT could be our variant of choice. Even though Seltos HTK plus iMT remains the most VFM. But hesitant to go for Seltos due to low safety ratings and Creta S doesn't offer many features in comparison. Even got our existing car evaluated for exchange by Skoda(yet to hear back from them). Overall satisfied with the vehicle but will wait for the booking till these initial niggles are sorted out and the Taigun is launched. Even though both these are identical, I would prefer Taigun in case its not priced too high from Kushaq.

1429, vasi_raju , 18:13 ,BHPian,"Hello BHPians, Here is a short purchase, delivery, and initial ownership experience (I am writing my experience during the purchase of my close friend, We know each other more than 20 years and are like family staying in the same apartment complex.) in which I was an integral part of Budgeting, Analysis, TD, Pre Delivery Inspection, and delivery of Skoda Kushaq 1.0 TSI Ambition AT. It always feels so good to keep reading and looking into articles about a potential candidate you want to zero down on. Since this was made as a suggestion to my friend, I was extra cautious about what would be the final product. So it all begins with a Requirement Specification Document :-) and here is the list which we had UsageThe vehicle is mostly going to be a highway-driven one which should accommodate a family of 4+ 1. Inter-City usage is restricted to weekend usage. Category of vehicle This is the tricky one which I was trying hard to convince my friend. I will come to the reasons in a little while.As the initial process, we kept the list open which consisted of CSUV, Crossovers, Hatchbacks, Sedans. Transmission type This was decided to be an Automatic one well ahead. In a city like Bangalore, it makes more sense to keep life simple. Budget The initial thought was to keep it below 12L. Part-1 The list of candidates we started looking into are the ones below. I will detail the reasons for not choosing which we thought is applicable as per our requirements. I am also classifying this into 2 parts. Tata NexonNexon was the first car we tried. The showroom was filled with people and we were happy for TATA. LikesGood exterior build quality Better safety rating DislikesPoor interior quality Head Nods due to AMT Honda Jazz LikesWell trusted and highly proven engine Wonderful real estate inside the car DislikesInterior looks Buggy/Not so friendly touch buttons for AC, infotainment A decade-old design Possibility of the model moving away from India to make way for the City Hatchback Hyundai i20 IVT LikesFeature-rich car The turbo engine DislikesInterior space Not a VFM vehicle No car with IVT was available for a TD KIA Sonet LikesFeature-rich car The turbo engine DislikesInterior space Not a VFM vehicle Maruthi Suzuki S-Cross LikesWas better than any MSIL product Had a rich experience in the NEXA showroom Dislikes4 speed AT (Old, outdated) An old facelifted design which will get a new version soon Nissan Magnite Then came the News and ADs about Nissan Magnite. With the killer pricing, we went with it and checked the vehicle. It was a true VFM vehicle. The TDs went smooth and my friend (who is a first-time buyer) was happy with it as it was fitting his bill and had all the bells and whistles for a car at this price. We went ahead and booked the Vehicle on Jan 2, 2021, with*XV Premium Turbo CVT Dual Tone in Flare Garnet Red & Onyx Black color.* Then started the waiting game. The delivery as per the time when we booked was the end of April. By March the 2nd way kicked in and the dealer did not communicate any delay to us. By end of April, the delivery was pushed to the end of June. We waited till June, and then came another delay info due to global chip shortage which pushed the delivery to end July. When we checked in July the dealer said the delivery can happen only by October due to employee Strike, high demand, etc. We lost our patience and started the process from scratch again.* By this time, my friend had a Job change and was ok to increase the budget by a few lakhs. Part-2 This time we kept the budget to 16-18 Lakhs On-Road Bangalore.* Within those 7 months (Jan to July), I sold my car (Swift Dzire, VDI) and got an All New Honda City V (CVT) which came to 15.3 Lakhs On-Road Bangalore.* With prior research already done by me for cars between 13 to 17 Lakhs range, I recommended him to go with the All-New Honda City V (CVT). I am 5' 8"" and the Low Body, seating worked well for me. My friend who is 6' 2"" tried it and was hitting his head in the roof and the knees in the dashboard which made us rule out the Sedans.* The only options we had were KIA Seltos Hyundai Creta Skoda Kushaq Unfortunately, we do not have too many options between 15 to 20 Lakhs budget. KIA Seltos was ruled out simply because of the build quality. We had a first-hand experience shared by one of my close friends who had to spend 50k to fix an AC issue due to a dog hitting the fog lamp on a highway. Hyundai though was a little better than KIA, we did not want to spend that much money for a car that is soon going to have a facelift version released. Mahindra XUV 700 was not in the picture when we were deciding, so we had no problems :-) The only contender was Skoda Kushaq. Test Drive and Booking Experience On understanding our requirements well now and after doing enough background research, we went to the showroom and checked the car. It was TAFE Access in ORR, HSR Layout and we checked out the car in detail. We also had another guy whom we met in the showroom who was interested in booking Kushaq after seeing the social media post about Seltos. He had booked a Manual one and was planning to cancel the Seltos booking due to the same safety and quality reason. We stuck a deal in the showroom in TD so that we can understand the ride quality better. We were in the back seat for his TD and he was in the back seat for our TD. The idea was to get each others opinions on the ride, comfort, and build quality. The vehicle had a good build quality, features, comfort. I have driven my friend KIA Seltos for close to 2 months and I felt the drive quality, seat back support is better in Kushaq. I fell in love with the steering, the volume controls, and the display quality of the infotainment system. We decided that the Mid variant will suit the requirements as the ventilated seat, Sunroof, etc are not something we wanted. The thing which I missed from the top variant is the Black Alloys. Since the showroom did not contain an Orange vehicle (Ambition) in place, I was worried how the alloys of Ambition will look like in the color we opted for. We went ahead and discussed the booking formalities, offers, etc. we were told that the delivery for the color we opted will take a month and no offers are applicable due to demand. After heading home, we checked with other dealers. PPS Skoda had a vehicle available and was also offering discounts on insurance, basic accessory kits. We asked if a TD can be arranged at home and we got one to show to the family. Did a TD again with family and they liked it. This time I wanted to check if there were any rubber band effect and took it for a spin in ORR stretch. Was able to feel the turbo kicking in on sudden acceleration and that was something which anyway was not a deal-breaker for us. We decided to go with the booking and paid a token. The vehicle was allocated for us and we started the loan formalities. In a week's time, we got a call that the vehicle is available for pre-delivery inspection post which they can go ahead with the registration process. Pre Delivery Inspection Thanks to our team of enthusiasts for sharing all the required things to check for. With the list in place we went and checked the vehicle. Skoda has done a neat job of keeping the Engine Chassis Number easily readable from the front. I am not sure how much of it will be useful as I have hardly used the engine number for any events but still appreciate the job. The ODO was 50KMs. We were informed that the dealer does a test, inspect the car before the registration process. Below are few clicks of the beauty on the day of PDI. We went to a yard that had VW, Skoda, and Mahindra Cars, and I was feeling like a kid taken to a Toy Store that day :-) Delivery Day Post-registration, the dealer took 5 working days to get the secure number plate fitted (which is way too long, as I could get my car delivered the next day after registration with number plates). We went to the showroom by 3 PM, took an hour to get all the details about the car to make sure we don't miss anything. Below are few clicks of the beauty on the day of Delivery Ready for Delivery Myself, My Friends Dad and My Friend getting the delivery :-) Initial Ownership Experience Since I own a Honda City, and had been driving the KIA Seltos for 3+ months when I did not have a car, I will keep this section more of a comparison between the 3 cars (wherever applicable) as I feel it might help any potential buyer. Right from the showroom, I got to drive it 30+ KMs straight with a mix of highway/city experience. The car is very peppy, loved the soft pedals which zip when we press it a little hard. The turbo kicks in well and asks us to revv more. From a point of view of fun to drive, I will rank Kushaq first, followed by City, and then will be the Seltos. I loved the design of the steering in Kushaq. Compared to Rapid, while driving it feels very light. The turning radius is pretty awesome. The floating design makes it an inch closer to the premium offerings. Once you get inside the car, mainly as a driver, you feel the space inside the Kushaq. The positioning of them is a little irritating and requires some time to get used to. For eg., the indicators, wipers are the opposite. The central lock-in is in the middle below the infotainment system. You will need some intelligence to know how to unlock the car as there is no unlock all door's button. For this price, I would have expected a wireless charger in place. Since all the ports are type-c, make sure you are prepared to get a set to use in the car. The infotainment system is top-notch, the quality of the display is excellent when compared to a Honda City (or) KIA Seltos. On the audio front, I will rate it wonderful but Seltos scores here. I really like the LED units, the throw of them is excellent. Definitely better than the Seltos and City. The stock tires look good to hold for the next 35+k km. The wheels are also rightly sized. The color of the alloy for the mid variant could have also been black. Ingress and exit in Kushaq felt better for me compared to Seltos. Not comparing the City here as it is a different class/structure. The seating back support for a driver in Kushaq is wonderful compared to the Seltos and City. In Kushaq the rear is for strictly 2 Adults + 1 Kid. The Seltos scored better here outperforming the City. In terms of rear legroom, City leads followed by both kushaq and Seltos. The boot is manageable for weekend travel. With the option to remove the tray, you can pile a couple of extra luggage in Kushaq. Minor things like Child Lock of rear doors require us to have the keys handy without which you cannot set or reset the door from the child lock. In City, it is a physical button which had been very useful for me till now. If I am doubtful on the move while taking my son alone with me, I can stop the car without turning the engine off, check if the child lock is set and then start driving back. The Tyre Pressure Sticker is stuck on the passenger side door in the front (Meehh, Why Zac?) We also get a holder to place a parking timer card (common in Europe) which I don't know why we are having in India. The rear cameras are good, the rear looks are also good. They have given a nice notch for the boot button. The rear of Skoda definitely looks a segment up mainly because of the metal prints of SKODA placed (Gives some feel as if it's a Volvo). For the price paid, there is not Push to START/STOP button. Call it cost-cutting? It makes one feel as if the car is not so premium whenever they start it. Also, there is no Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS). Not so happy with this decision Zac. Overall, the car is definitely a good buy among the current lot with very few to pick from for someone looking for an SUV in a 15-20 Lakh budget.

1433, DragonHawk , 14:02 ,BHPian,"I feel sorry for the folks whoever has reported EPC issues, hope Skoda addresses it urgently and wins back the buyer's confidence. It has been over 2 weeks now since I got my Kushaq 1.5MT and I have covered almost 1000kms now and thought of sharing some updates before my ownership review is ready. What I liked: * Punchy TSI motor, no doubt I had bought this car only for this engine, and boy o boy it just pulls like a locomotive. I just feel addicted to driving this motor and genuinely it is one of the best fun to drive machine I have ever driven. * Suspension is neutral which is neither soft nor too hard. This dynamic nature offers a much more plush ride and is more evident from the feedback I had received from my wife who often complains of motion sickness while traveling in Ecosport but here she feels much more comfortable. * LED headlights are super bright but it is shame that Skoda offers normal halogen for fog lamps. * Skoda Sound system is the next best I have seen from OEM stable. What I didn`t like: * Infotainment system has a mind of its own. So far I have witnessed a couple of niggles, during one instance I found that speakers stopped working altogether. System reset didn`t work at first instance and after the second try, it started working as if nothing has happened. Apart from that, I have seen the rear camera display was not coming in the infotainment system and had to resort to a system reset. Both these issues were seen only once and being a new launch, these kinds of minor niggles are expected, and hope Skoda will address them during the next update. * For the past few days I am hearing squeaking noise coming from the Sunroof. It is so irritating that I feel like driving by keeping the sunroof open. Temporarily I could fix this by using velcro straps and so far no noise, hope it stays like that till I get it checked at Skoda ASC. * One thing which I am totally unhappy with Skoda is the cheap quality AC vents. AC vent slider is so fragile that one of it already gave up. * MySkoda Connect is still not working, ideally, the dealer should have configured it during delivery and due to some internal issues, it is still pending. However, I am happy with the way Skoda CC has been following up and has kept me updated. I hope this gets resolved soon. Overall I would say Kushaq has all the essence of a blockbuster product. With all the hoopla around localization, Skoda successfully managed to spoil their fortune by offering the product with missing features, cost cutting by means of using cheap plastics, and pricing blunder.

Mileage in city is between 11.5 to 13 and on highways around 17. I have been driving a VW Vento 1.6 TDI since 2012 and feel that there not much of let down in build quality or interiors in Kushaq except the power windows which are not all one touch operation. Sound quality in old Vento feels better even with 4 speaker setup (maybe personal choice, nothing to complain here). Kushaq's light is very good considering that Vento's stock light fixtures can be classified as poor.

As of now, I am happy with the car and the ride quality it offers, trust is something which will be built as I run the mill more. I have plans for 3500 kms highway run in Oct-Nov '21 on Kushaq. One problem (don't know if it really is but I find it weird) that I have observed in Kushaq (3 times in 30 days) is that the ORVM closed themselves and opened again in midst of driving without any command from my side.

I wouldn't normally bother too much but the Polo that was crash-tested by Global NCAP in 2014 didn't have them either and it missed out on scoring the minimum 5-star points for frontal impact (I'm not sure if the lack of pretensioners was related to that but a chest score going from acceptable to good would bump it up to at least 13.00).

May have something to do with the new adult headform tests that came with AIS-100 pedestrian protection regulation, but don't take my word for it. The misfit fuel tank lid is not what you'd expect from VAG though - it certainly doesn't seem as well-built as older VWs (which as far as I know were put together very well with tight tolerances). I'm finding the EPC errors quite concerning. I can understand niggles, we've come to expect them from VW-Škoda (ours make many trips to the garage for minor issues), they're usually not that big a deal. But new cars breaking down unexpectedly and being rendered undrivable is unusual. Don't get me wrong, I have no intention of defaming Škoda, but I think we can all agree that multiple new cars breaking down over the same issue is never a good thing, whatever brand they may come from. I hope Škoda issues a recall and replacement of the defective part soon. Quote: Originally Posted by vinitbarve rattling sound from the Power Window Interesting.

1446, cpabhijit , 15:31 ,BHPian,"Parents bought a Kushaq. Story in brief, is as follows: After dad retired, they sold their car and shifted to BLR. And both me & my brother shifted out in quick succession. Rotten luck, I know. With limited travel needs, they managed for 2 years but Ola/Uber was always complicated and increasingly, required tiresome coordination. Outstation trips were difficult. With the pandemic continuing, we decided that it'd be best for them to have a car with a chauffeur. We checked out the following cars: Maruti - Brezza - interior space was cramped and of very poor quality. No rear AC vents in any model. XL6 - Ticked all boxes but was quite big for just the 2 of them. Honda - WRV - Did one test drive and it was kinda okay except that the car now is quite old. I like the looks of the car but interiors are terribly dated. And, nobody at Honda was interested in making a sale. After a few follow ups for a repeat test drive, gave up. Skoda - Rapid - Solid car, been here for ages, well sorted. But sedan, seating was too low for them and being BLR, GC is always a concern. Kushaq - Parents loved the test drive. Excellent rear space and seating comfort. It had everything they wanted so booked Ambition 1.0 MT. Tornado Red. Scheduled for delivery on 14th Aug, got delayed and finally delivered on 27th Aug. Overall buying experience was smooth and nothing to complain or gush about. Drove the car for ~500kms over the weekend and here are my quick observations - Pros Addictive driving experience - engine is quick and pulls like crazy. Gear shifts are well defined and have short throws. Steering is pleasing to hold and is precise. Stalks and steering controls are nice to use. Music system is excellent (I had not expected it to be this good) Rear seat comfort is one of the best. Acres of legroom, sufficient head room and for the 5th passenger, the transmission tunnel isn't too high. Ride quality is spot on. Sort of firm but pliant. Framed wiper at the rear - Maybe a good thing. All the frame-less ones I have seen (rear only..front ones work fine), tip of the wiper loses contact with the glass in under 6 months. ConsPower window switches are horrible. Hated using them. The One touch power window on the driver side was iffy. It sometimes went down when I pulled up the switch from a semi open position. The cabin lights and their controls too are of questionable quality. Not at all pleasing to use. Roof liner creaks and gives way everywhere. Engine noise - What's with the engine noise, really?! It is quite a lot and distracting. At times, I couldn't hear the music. Lack of damping + an unrefined motor? Not acceptable. Both my GT and Karoq are so so silent that they seem to purr along at all speeds. This one has a loud, raspy growl. Why the single tone horn? Doesn't sound good. And it is incredibly hard to press. The 1st time around, the chauffeur was trying in every possible way to honk Clutch travel is way too long. Having not been used to an MT for quite a while now, my left leg got a good workout. Checked with my SA if he had any updates on the EPC issue. He says there aren't any complaints logged in BLR.

Agree with most points apart from boot space. Coupe shape in TROC means that there is limitations in way the boot space can be best used. Secondly legroom in the back is lot better in both Taigun and Kushaq compared to TROC. Thirdly Volkswagen has removed features in 2021 Vs 2020 TROC and hiked prices. Personally if you look TROC as standalone product it doesnt offer much value but when pitched against Taigun or Kushaq seems better value. This is why TROC sales have picked up recently. Sales advisor at Volkswagen also confirmed that they are receiving lot of enquiries and test drive requests. TROC has nil discounts and once honeymoon period is over for Taigun / Kushaq there will be discounts, which would be the right time to assess the value offering. One big factor that most of the folks have missed is that TROC will get a facelift next year. Substantial changes expected in styling and interior. As these are CBU and if VW sticks to bring through the import route, we are looking at one of the last pre facelift versions being sold here . Resale value of TROC 4-5 years down the lane will only hold up if Volkswagen still continues to offer the product in market else the depreciation will be much higher.

1469, karan561 , 22:08 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"My Skoda Kushaq, Delivery Experience Video; https://youtu.be/NnG-m_Y4tjU ^ The Video captures all the excitement from the Delivery/Collection Day of my Skoda Kushaq. It also includes a quick Walkaround discussing the Exterior/Interior, Platform, Engine/Gearbox, Tyres etc. & also explains my buy decision. Buy Decision/Booking; This car was booked without checking her out in the showroom & without a Test Drive. In fact the first time I saw/experienced a Kushaq was in my car on the day of the PDI. Special thanks & credit goes to TEAM-BHP Official Review which helped me go ahead with this choice without having the need to go check her out physically or requiring a Test Drive Dealership Experience; I had 2 dealers (JMD & Mody) in mind & I had given both of them the opportunity. JMD was not really interested to sell & at the same time i had got to know what one of their dealerships in New Mumbai had recently shut down hence it was not really confidence inspiring for me to put my money at JMD hence naturally i picked Mody as it was a newer (Opened in early 2021) & more responsive dealership. The Corporate Manager at Mody Skoda was very professional and kept most communication via email & always available over phone too. Mody Skoda did not charge me any extra money for things like vehicle handling charges or compulsory accessory kits etc. Insurance too was very high at first as per Skoda Insurance but they matched my quote and also allowed self registration without unnecessary arguments but did verify data/facts to seek official permission. Extended Warranty Payment is still pending & as per Mody Skoda i will receive a link to pay the extended warranty amount online (Other Kushaq owners may want to confirm this). Overall my experience with Mody Skoda right from Booking to PDI to Delivery process was Very Satisfactory. Driving Experience; Car Delivery/Collection days are always filled with excitement but for the Kushaq it was a bit more exhilarating as it was the 1st time i was driving the Kushaq & i am happy to report that just after a few kms of driving the Kushaq through multiple road/traffic conditions i felt reassured of my buy decision. The 1L TSI Engine with 115 HP & 178NM felt good enough for Mumbai traffic & local highways with enough overtaking power to maintain a healthy pace. Haven't really pushed the engine so far as obviously would like to adhere to the running in guidelines as much as possible. The Aisin (AQ250) Gearbox too was smooth enough for bumper to bumper traffic again reassuring my decision to not to go for a DSG (Dual Clutches dont like traffic scenarios) as this car will be used mostly in City/Traffic Conditions for short distance runs. I am aware about the unfortunate EPC issues faced by many Kushaq owners, hoping for a trouble free ownership for my car & also hoping Skoda India resolve this for everyone. Overall the place where the Kushaq really shines is the ride quality. The ride was really good for a newly delivered car, I not confirm if the PDI team had reduced tyre pressures to normal levels post transit, however wasn't sure how to check the TPMS (or may be its missing) hence cant confirm what the pressures were. Braking is adequate (Still running in) for the 1L TSI upfront. Will reserve my comments on the handling performance as yet to really experience good corners or mountain roads (plus the tyres are also very new). The new 2 spoke Steering Wheel is extremely well designed and finished, hope i could say this about the whole interior. Miscellaneous Observations; - Love the way the Skoda Kushaq looks. Front is aggressive at the same time athletic looking. The Side profile is clean & sticking to the European roots of the brand which i love. Rear feels upright thanks to the positioning of the taillights & gets a sense of being wide with S K O D A lettering spaced out. - Infotainment is not the most friendly system I've used, but the touch sensitivity is good & lag free. - Digital Cluster would have been welcome, probably Skoda India has reserved that for the facelift. - 17"" Atlas Rims look striking in person & were my main reason to pick the Style variant. - Being a new comer the Kushaq is attracting eyeballs & has a good street presence. - Missing out on the rear disc brakes in favour of the drums is visually disturbing. - The creep function in the D Mode is a bit too aggressive/eager for my linking. - Paddle Shifters have been given which is nice. (Miss them in my 1.4 Seltos) - Yet to use the My Skoda App, so will reserve my comments on that. - Camera Quality is Above Average & I Miss the 360 Deg. Camera. - Ambient lighting needed more colours (Gets only white) - Power window operation/sound is noisy & feels cheap. - Dont really miss the Driving Modes (Sport, Eco Etc.) - The Horn is Non German tone, a bad move/miss. - Music System (7 Speakers) does sound good. - The glovebox is large & very accommodative. - 6 Airbags for M/T & Only 2 for A/T, Why ? - Would have preferred 215mm wide tyres. - Rear Boot space is surprisingly good. - Rear Seat space is good, not great. - Powered Seats are missed.

I looked at carwale comparison and for some reason it showed prices at ex-showroom for one and on road for another (both Chandigarh). On road comparison works to about ~4.3L dearer for T-Roc in CDG. But the point on cost cutting remains - of which build is merely one aspect. These are mechanical - critical parts failing. 1.0 has been available in the country. And so has 1.5 Tsi. Works fine on whatever fuel is available. Logical extension is, they've gone overboard on the cut-price models. The new platform is untested and we can only guess how it will compare with the imports. The larger point is, why not simply sell CKD TRocs? Or better, make the same damn car here! Investing like that, spending (wasting) precious time . As far as profits are concerned, I wonder what stopped VAG from doing more volumes....prices and costs associated with their cars (most people who own VAG cars are happy to pay a premium) or unreliability of some of their parts and services after. Have you come across a VAG customer that is unhappy with their car? Their buyers loved their cars and retained them for long (mine's done 1.25L in its tenth year). I just hated the number of times the car came back from workshop with small parts missing / broken. I hated that they never were able to solve issues in 10 visits and 60 grand in repair costs which reliable FNGs did a fantastic job of solving in 1 visit and 2.5 grand! I hated that they knew about the injector issues and didn't do a recall - which they'd have happily done in any other country. Or solved DSG issues. It seems odd that they started off by changing the very / only thing that made them good - the damn car . And lo and behold - the issues have all remained - the group on MG ZS has a few people already calling out the difference in their showroom experience vs VW. Cars are already failing.

You are comparing with MG and new cars, have you forgotten the number of instances where brand new Hectors were stranded on the road and smoke coming out of them. The number of DCT issues, Hyundai and Kia has. My ex Ignis AC compressor had to be replaced in 5000 kms. Honda City's clutch had to be replaced within 3000 kms. Injector issues you are saying ?? Are you even aware of what's happening with Duster 110 PS since 2012. There are people in this forum or the extended one, where Duster injectors have failed within 2500 kms (brand new car), all 4 and by the time it is 7500 kms it has failed again and had to towed back. People who have lost 6 injectors in 10000 kms. Multiple cars whose injectors have failed within 15000 kms. But Renault says everything is fine, it's fuel problem. It's an issue since 2012 and 9 years past, they still haven't solved it. What about the 67 million cars recalled with the airbag updates, the famous Takata airbag scandal. There was life risk there not just car getting stalled. Imaging realizing that you have been driving around with a ticking time bomb in front of your face, literally, by something that is actually supposed to save your life. Now Maruti has recalled 1.8L cars for a motor change saying it is a safety hazard. What about Ford's DPF issues. Haven't they tested their cars ?? Now they are running off. The steering rack and pump issue of old Honda Civics. From 2006 to 2013, they still didn't solve it. It's the same everywhere brother. The point is parts failing due to manufacturing defect is non-negotiable. Doesn't matter if it is brand new or after 2 years. Wear and tear parts we know, we can change them. Other parts failing no matter when, means the vehicle is unreliable. And it is the sad truth for every brand for some or the other model of theirs. Have said this before and am saying again. Testing cars with prototype parts and mass producing them are a huge difference. That's why it is always advised not to buy a new launch, if you do it's your risk. You really think the new XUV 700 will come with zero issues in the first few batches.

What bothers me is why time and again this part fails. You are one brave man to still hold that decade old gem of a car my friend. Why not TROC? Answer wouldn’t be straightforward. Investment on a platform will not be to meet a country specific requirements. Cars on this platform surely destined to be exported to other markets. This will be longer strategy to get returns. Rational behind such heavy investment would have been thought through deeper. Any government incentive scheme by boosting local manufacturing? Similar to PLI scheme. I would have loved if Skoda would have got Kamiq and Volkswagen the TROC to localised it. Wouldn’t boss who has signed the big cheque would have raised this?

This cost cutting expense is the one not going well with the existing base of owners. Why trust them? My answer is trust no one. Just take delivery of any brand car and pray to god that you haven’t ended up with a Lemon. Our laws are not pro consumers. Even other brands have failed miserably. New cars catching fire, breaks failing, car splitting into two, not able to solve dpf issues, zero star safety but the PR of these companies have managed it better.

Even the Thar which is a niche vehicle, had 25K plus bookings soon after launch if I remeber right. I think the premium pricing and the initial reports of ECU issues exaggerated hugely in social media were the root causes of the low number of bookings. To recover quickly , Skoda will need to do something that will bring in a whole new segment of buyers and create ripples in the market. One way may be to offer a ""Festival Special"" edition that can be booked during October and November. This could be the Active Variant minus the infotainment system and speakers for 9.99 lakhs. Now that will deliver some shock value and a sharp increase in bookings, as a whole new segment of customers who go for compact SUVs like Ecosport and Sonet or the base variants of the Creta to slip under the 10L road tax bracket wil be attracted to Kushaq. In a state like TN, the difference in on-road price, between a car priced at 9.99 lakhs and one priced at 10.5 lakhs is not 50 K, it is 1.1 lakhs Financially this will not impact Skoda much as well.

1516, VEA , 10:27 ,BHPian,"Existing owners of Kushaq will feel cheated when a new variant or product change is brought out within a couple of months of launch. Skoda seriously over estimated their strength to sell the Kushaq as-is in large numbers in the Indian market. I have serious doubts that this new iteration may have other subtle improvements including better interior fit and finish and materials etc apart from the 6 airbags and TPMS. Skoda may price it at a max 30-50k higher so that existing owners are not felt cheated and prospective buyers wont feel its overpriced. Any higher than this the exiting owners will suddenly feel they have a VFM product in their hands and potential buyers looking elsewhere. Within a year in all probability the increased price will be neutralised with discounts once the new product sheen wears off. I had booked a Kushaq style variant and wasnt really bothered about about the EPC issue. I gave Skoda the benefit of doubt and it seems they have responded well to the issue. Now, the car is due to arrive at the dealer next week and I am supposed to make the payment sometime soon. The news of a new variant or updated style variant has dampened my enthusiasm.

Yes, the initial buyers may feel cheated, but this is always the case when existing issues are corrected on a car ( facelift or otherwise ). While previous buyers may not get 6 airbags, they did get everything else at a cheaper price. What needs to be seen is:How much price will be increased? I think it would be between 1L to 1.8L. Now, would this price justify the additional amount over the competition? Which features will get removed? I am sure few features from Style AT variant will be removed to keep the price competitive ( to keep it ~1L ). Similar to how VW Taigun 1.5 DSG GT+ does not get Ventilated seats.

So, if the driver takes the foot off the accelerator pedal completely, does the DSG automatically disengage the clutch? Yes, it has Coasting function. (The engine will be disengaged and run at idling speed. The vehicle rolls without the braking effect of the engine.) As per T Roc manual When the selector lever is in position D/S and neither the accelerator nor the brake pedal is depressed, the vehicle will roll (“coast”) with practically no energy being consumed. In coasting mode, the momentum of the vehicle can be used to save fuel in conjunction with an anticipatory driving style. The engine no longer brakes the vehicle – the vehicle can roll for a longer distance. The function is available only in the selector lever position D/S and at speeds of approximately 40 – 130 km/h (25 mph – 80 mph). Initiating coasting — Take your foot off the accelerator. Depending upon different conditions, car can go into three different mode a) Coasting Mode b) Engine braking mode: Again press the accelerator pedal very gently for 1-2 seconds & release it. Coasting mode will activate. c) None of the above : Again press the accelerator pedal very gently for 1-2 seconds & release it. Coasting mode will activate.

The Taigun, Astor and XUV700 are all eagerly awaited. Once these launch there will be a lull in new 20L SUV launches. Once the dust settles we will see the actual numbers. Also after driving the Kushaq, I came back quite underwhelmed and disappointed. The interiors are more of 10L hatchback than a 20L european SUV. It compares to the Ecosport and at some places better and some places even lesser. Skoda have read the market wrong. India 2.0 should not have been cheapened out interiors with such glaring cost cutting. Looking at MG, it's the chinese who have figured out what the mass market wants more than the Korean and European. It's kind of ironic that Skoda is around in India for 20+ years and the whole point of India 2.0 plan was that they have understood what the Indian consumer wants and coming with a product that caters to them thanks to the learnings of 20 years. Whereas infact the whole point of India 2.0 was to do what Toyota did with the Etios is to give a cut cost heavily cheapened out car for India. The cars had reliability issues earlier and buyers always had that in back of their minds. India 2.0 should have addressed that. Instead we see more new Skoda's on flat beds than even before. The chinese in 2 years come out with a car that checks almost all boxes, feature loaded, nice quality interiors, premium design, good drivetrain specs and no weird variant line up like no 6 airbags on top spec.

Yeah even if its the case it would not warrant a production or a dispatch cut so soon. It would only happen when dealers are choking with inventory. So the real impact would only be observed 2-3 months down the line when inventory increases and then the production plan would be changed. But things like this can make or break the product.

1589, VEA , 19:39 ,BHPian,"I got my Kushaq 1.5 DSG two days back. Have done around 450 kms and its a joy to drive. I find it the right size for me with no excess body fat to carry around. Its small, nimble and has great all round visibility. Together with the great engine/gearbox and good ride and handling, it feels like I am wearing the car, rather than driving one. Kushaq has a well packaged interior, you get more interior space on the smallest possible exterior. Its is small, and at best called a crossover. I don't think any vehicle without a 4wd system can be called an SUV. Now the not so good bits. It doesn't feel like the Skodas from the past. Not like the ones I have used. Its basically a cheaply built car with its interiors a shame for any self respecting European. There is no doubt all the competitors are much superior in the interior department. There is a minor squeak from the A pillar. Nothing bothersome, but it is there on a brand new car. One has to be brave to buy a Kushaq now considering the negativity surrounding it. I am no way a Skoda fan. Have owned and used Skoda cars from the initial years, and it was a mixed bag. Had used DSG boxes before and one had a mechatronics failure. But I felt I had no choice, everything else in the competition and price bracket is inferior in the fun to drive aspect. Troc is probably the only one that beats this in this budget. But the rear seat space concern made me cancel the booking, plus the dealer didn't have a test drive car. A test drive might have appealed to my heart and bypass the head. There is never a niggle free car in my opinion. Everything I have used had some issues or other, mostly minor. The cars that are loved and kept are the ones that are fun to drive.

1591, Abhishek.ckt , 16:06 ,Newbie,"To break the EPC jinx, I drove my Ambition 1.0 alone from Noida to Ranchi ~1250 kms from 02-03 Oct 2021. Had got the fuel pump replaced (on recall, I didn't face any problem with original pump too) on 01 Oct 2021 in New Delhi and refuelled with normal petrol in Noida (tank full). The new fuel pump that was installed was one made in Germany. Day 1 - Drove 809 kms from Noida to Varanasi via Agra, Lucknow, Rae Bareli and Prayagraj Bypass. I started the journey at 4 AM. For approx 500 kms, car was driven on cruise control set at 99 kmph. After driving for 400 kms, got the tank refuelled with normal petrol from a countryside Reliance outlet. Total journey time was 12 hours including 2 breaks of 15 minutes each. Top speed attained was 110 kmph. Day 2 - Drove from Varanasi to Ranchi via Dehri-on-Sone and Hazaribagh. Started at 4 AM in morning and reached destination at 11 AM (approx 440 kms). Got the tank refuelled at a countryside fuel pump with normal petrol. This was the only 10 minute break in entire journey of 2nd day. Fuel level didn't go down below 1/4th as I don't feel comfortable with those levels on a long drive. Top speed attained was 125 kmph. Observations, hits and misses are as follows: 1. Shock absorbers are effective and small speed breaker or pot holes are absolutely not felt over normal driving speed range. 2. Lights are very good. High beam focus is awesome and it makes night driving a breeze. 3. Good Year tyres were not that noisy as reported by several people. I have been using Yokohama Earth on my other car and can say noise level in Good Year was lower. Though it is too early to comment looking at the fact that Good Year tyres are just 2 months old. One thing that I noticed was vehicle swaying a bit to the right when running over chain of small speed breakers with braking action in progress. I never experienced this in my Vento which would always maintain its line. This may also be because of ABS action if not tyre or other issue (Kushaq is the first car with ABS that I have punished this way, my Vento doesn't have ABS and several other cars that I have driven didn't encounter this situation on road). 4. Stability is rock solid. I never felt worried even for a moment in the hills taking turns at speed as high as 70 to 90 kmph. Car felt in good control all the time. 5. Not pleased with the cabin light switch, one of them misses at times and needs to be pressed hard. 6. Expect a mileage between 18 to 19 on highways. Overall, I am happy with my new car as it is meeting the purpose for which it was purchased (reducing my point A to B timings on long drives).", 3rd October 2021,skoda-kushaq,Noida,19,73,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

I have just driven a little over 100Km as the vehicle is yet to be registered and is getting delayed understandably owing to some glitches in the registration portal here in Delhi. The OR price to me is around 16L as I refused to take insurance and accessories kit from the Dealer. The buying experience was good and found the sales advisor Rohit Anand quite amiable and customer oriented. The issue of 'EPC' faced by some Kushaq customers was a matter of concern but then experience of 125 years of Car making experience of Skoda is confidence instilling. I remember vehicle stalling issues initially faced by Maruti Zen users way back in 1995 and it turned out to be chocking of fuel filter by bad quality fuel. Later success of Zen is history. I am told that only few kushaq customers reported 'EPC' issues and as per Skoda the 'EPC' alert is not a defect but an alert to prevent damage to engine functioning. In this case it is reported from the fuel pump as the sensor there reports bad quality and or lower octane fuel being fed to the TSI Engine. The sticker on the backside of the fuel lid in Kushaq recommends filling with 91-95 Octane fuel.

I don't think any OEM TPMS system uses the external sensor concept you have described. It is either a sensor inbuilt into the valve if it is a direct TPMS system or like NevGin has explained in the indirect TPMS system. The sensor cap on the valve concept is an aftermarket one. The indirect TPMS system uses wheel speed signals to compare the rolling circumference of each tyre from the set reference point and can detect a puncture accordingly., 11th October 2021,skoda-kushaq,Pune,"1,931","3,759",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

The AC performance of both the cars were good, almost on par with the Civic but it's also a rainy day. What sets them apart from the Kushaq is the cabin width.

Handled well, the steering just speaks like the Civic, was able to hold 120 KMH in the sweeping corners of highways, masked the pathetic broken tarmac very well, NVH levels were good, offered a broad sense of space albeit the dull interiors and some ergonomic flaws like cramped foot well, fouling armrest and the tall seating position! The Duster may seem more VFM yet it's terrible inside. Steel flats for fastening the seat base and door sheet metals were all exposed! The doors too felt skinny! Ruled out.

I was with my business partner, and he had just got done with booking the hotel over a call and we were having a casual chat, it was around 7:30 PM, there were no street lights and as usual oncoming traffic with their high beams on, I made an error of misjudging a left curve and when I realised it was already too late and now we were on the shoulder of the road, which had a lot of loose debris, I could do nothing to stop the car from falling down the hill, I held on to the steering and closed my eyes, our car flipped while falling down and landed on it's roof, hitting a tree, finally killing the momentum. None of this happened in slow motion, it happened too quickly. Both of us were conscious and quickly checked on each-other if everything was okay, I could taste my own blood, which made me realise that I was injured, the airbag had popped out and I could smell the explosives and saw the smoke as well, the i20 was continuously chiming and the engine had turned itself off. I quickly unbuckled and got out, my fellow passenger wasn't able to unbuckle, so went to the other side and helped him come out. Once out, we realised that we were in a mess, I had lost my phone during the accident and the co passenger had no network, we tried asking for phone from passerby's but there were reluctant, finally a good samaritan helped us make a few calls. Key takeaways from the accident Worn tires, although still under the limit, but the tires were out of their perfomance envelope Being prepared is important, not panicking can make a huge difference during such mis-happenings I had a long day that day and I think that could have affected my focus The next morning, my car was brought out of the ditch with help of a crane, once it was out, I quickly opened the bonnet to check on the internals and saw a pretty big hole in the engine block with a lot of other damage and I said it to myself that it's a total loss, took the car to the nearest Hyundai workshop and an estimate of around 12.5 lacs was made and the guy confirmed it will be a total loss but told me that the final call remains with the surveyor. I was traumatised and was physically and mentally drained, my cousin had come with his friends, to help me out with all of this and we went home. Little did I know that it has just begun, the insurance guy called me the next day for a statement and few basic documents, which I provided. I had my insurance with New India Assurance and it took me 5 months of continuous emailing, followups, documentation to get my claim, they had numerous reasons every week to delay the settlement. I would suggest each on of you to go through your insurance policy very very carefully while you get your motor insurance and should know how to exercise your rights in such a situation, the insurance people will try to negotiate hard with you in such cases and would want you to get frustrated and just take their offer. Meanwhile, all of this happened, in the background I was continuously planning on how and what would I buy, for me a car is a companion and after I lost my i20, I felt like I had lost a close friend. A few pictures of the damaged vehicle : The Good Part I was test driving different cars and I was very sure that I wanted a well built, solid car, which could handle well, I was also very keen on a turbocharged petrol engine. Skoda had been talking about the Kushaq for months and it was on my radar, but I was a little skeptical about the prices and the A.S.S. I had Creta in my mind as a good upgrade, since I had been using a Hyundai for more than 10 years and I connect well with the brand overall. Also, checked out the Thar, it looked beautiful in red colour but sat inside and was not very happy with the space, the waiting period of 9 months was a little too much for me as I wanted the car asap. Kushaq was launched in the end of June and I got my hands on one a few days later and that very day I decided that I am buying the Kushaq. I liked how it drove over the broken roads and the TSI was impressive as well. Booked the 1.0 TSi MT in Honey Orange in early August and got it delivered in the end of the same month. Initial Impressions Kushaq feels solid on the highway and it makes you feel you're in complete control TSI is one heck of an engine, the kind of progress it can make on a highway is impressive, the engine sounds good when it's revved Small and medium sized potholes don't really disturb the composure Noise insulation is pretty good I really liked the throw of the LED lights during the highway drives Very fuel efficient EPC Issue Let me address the elephant in the room, while I was making this purchase, I was well aware of the EPC issue. The EPC light eventually came on my vehicle at around 2200 kms while I was in Himachal, I was able to drive back to Delhi though, I wrote to Skoda and my fuel pump was replaced along with a firmware update. I've moved on quickly from this and enjoying each kilometre on my new car. I've also noticed that post pandemic, almost every manufacturer is facing issues with QC, like for example, one of my friends had a failed clutch in his new Creta and every other day we keep hearing about something or the other with other brands as well. Fuel Efficiency While, this was not a parameter I considered while I was weighing my options, it really is a boon to have a fuel efficient car, keeping in mind the rising fuel prices. I'll let the pictures talk here : With this kind of fuel efficiency, I can easily pull 750 kms on a full tank while still being left with enough fuel to be on the safer side. I usually drive between 80-100 on highways and occasionally rev on smaller gears. Engine, Gearbox, Suspension Engine is one of the highlights of this vehicle, I have not driven the 1.5 TSi and I'll only talk about 1.0 TSI, the engine simply punches above it's weight, much above. You can never guess the size of the engine the way the Kushaq drives, the 3 cylinder is surprisingly smooth as well, mine is a manual and the gearshifts are short and one would like playing with the gears. Small and medium potholes aren't a problem anymore, I keep the tyre pressure at 33 on all four corners. At high speeds it is stable and it gives you a good sense of control. Somewhere in the Himalayas : 5000 KMS : Built Quaity Kushaq is nicely put together, paint quality is one of the best in the segment IMHO, to early to comment on but there are no rattles anywhere whatsoever, you won't hear any suspension sounds inside the cabin, I really liked how the cabin is insulated from all the outside noises and engine & gearbox noise as well, didn't really like the piano black finish inside as it can get scratched very easily and I feel with time, it'll loose it's lustre. Safety The Kushaq hasn't been through the NCAP yet, but with all the electronics on board, it should fare well in the tests, I appreciate how Skoda has given ESP, XDS+, EDL,MSR as standard equipment. Talking about XDS+/EDL, I actually felt it working on a curve, and it felt very stable and reassuring. Braking The pedal feel is likeable, had a close shave on the highway and the brakes did okay, however I've been noticing a lot of brake dust on my alloys, it may have something to do with the pad material or their softness. I'll have to give it more time to really draw a conclusion on the brakes. In-car Entertainment I am not very impressed with the audio quality, I would rate it average, Apple Car Play and Android Auto works seamlessly, in settings you have options for lights, wipers, door lock/unlock, tyres, the user interface is smooth and resolution is good. Sygic is the built-in maps (available on Skoda app store), it gives you options to download the maps for all Indian states, once you have it, you don't need the internet, so far I've downloaded maps for 4-5 states, however, Sygic is not so smart like Google Maps, if you don't follow the route suggested, it fails to re-route and keeps suggesting you to go back to the previous suggested route only, you wouldn't want to completely rely on Sygic. P.S. Rear view camera quality has improved post the firmware update. Quality of After Sales Service I took my car to Brite Skoda, Noida, for the fuel pump replacement, and spent a good 3+ hours there, the staff was courteous. I haven't been to a Skoda service centre before, so won't be able to compare but in absolute terms, I have nothing to complain, after the fitment of the new pump, they tested the fuel pressure with a pressure gauge for a while and observed and cross checked if everything was okay multiple times through OBD port. The service centre has also told me to use normal 91 octane petrol and according to them there's no need for 95 RON, however, the manual says that 95 RON is the recommended fuel and 91 RON should be used only in emergencies. According to Skoda's online service cost calculator, my first service should cost INR 3739 (without labour) and the second one INR 7444 (With labour), please note that the service intervals are 15000 KMS. IMHO, the service cost seems reasonable as long as the service advisor doesn't add up extras. Skoda also lets you check the cost of spare parts on their website. Noise, Vibration and Harshness Once you start the Kushaq, there is a slight vibration for around 20 secs and then the engine settles to a silky smooth idle, you don't hear much of engine sound inside unless you wring it, and once you do, you're going to like the way it sounds, the Kushaq literally glides on roads and you'll always feel like you're going slower than you actually are, on the 6th gear at 100 KMPH, the drive is relaxing and there's no audible wind noise or engine noise. Driving Position and Ergonomics All seat adjustments are manual in the Kushaq, and it could be a little bothersome if multiple people are going to be driving it, however once adjusted, seats are comfortable and offer good support. You can see the bonnet while you're driving and that gives you a sense of control and reminds you that you're driving a SUV/Crossover, steering has wide range of travel in both rake and reach and makes it easier to set it the way you like, road ahead has a good visibility, ORVMs do cover the road but they could've been better and could've offered a better visibility. What I Like Suspension Tuning TSI Engine Various electronic safety features The space inside The exterior design, we can expect it to age well Powerful LED headlights offer sufficient visibility Fuel efficiency Overall built quality What Could've Been Better I have a feeling that the airconditioning is slightly weak for our tropical climate ORVMs could have been bigger Missing on electronic seat adjustments Stock audio speakers could've been better In the end, it all comes down to making memories and spending good time with your loved ones.

You're absolutely correct, my night driving has come down considerably post accident, we were extremely lucky that we survived. One of the reasons why everyone should wear a seatbelt at all times. Quote: Originally Posted by R_throttle Can you share any details on F.E while driving most of the part in city? Expect a 13-14 km/l if you're within the city limits and your drive is on the shorter side, it could hit 15-15.5 km/l if your drive is longer. The long term picture of the fuel efficiency, which I have shared in my original post is 70% highway and 30% city. All in all, with the Kushaq you'll be happy with the fuel efficiency.

1663, kapursaket , 08:40 ,BANNED,"Factual position of Kushaq and Taigun 999cc TSI Engine ]The international engine of the year award is like the Oscars of the automotive industry; maybe even more prestigious. Automotive manufacturers around the world spend decades in research and development of their engines, trying to find the perfect balance between performance, reliability, efficiency and regulation compliance. And while it isnt exactly easy to make a large engine efficient and powerful, it is certainly easier than doing it with a tiny one. There are packaging restrictions, a general limit on how much power you can extract from it and you also run the risk of overworking the engine, compromising fuel efficiency and reliability. In 2018,*VAG*won the engine of the year award in the sub-1-litre class, with the 1.0 TSI engine (Kushaq and Taigun). The new three-cylinder turbocharged engine is more compact than before courtesy a smaller cubic capacity, and more modern construction. It is also lighter, weighing just under 90kg, thanks to aluminium pistons and hollowbored con-rod journals. The engineers have also done away with the balancer shaft to keep the weight low, and used lightweight components in the engine, which are also stiffer so reliability is not compromised. Speaking of reliability, the 1-litre TSI engine is also more robust with a forged crankshaft and con-rods, and integrated camshaft and valve covers. The crankshaft bearing has been coated with polymers to reduce friction during ignition and switching off the engine, while the cylinder head has been designed to ensure quick warm up in cold conditions, also aiding the longevity of the engine. Volkswagen has also modified the design of the intake port so there is a high flow rate, without affecting the quantity of the flow itself, while the swirling flow helps in ensuring a good air/fuel mixture to get more efficient combustion. The optimised pattern of injection also ensures that all load and speed conditions can be met with the least amount of fuel. There are also multiple injection patterns depending on cold starts, or the engine being under load at low revs  while climbing a steep slope for example. The turbocharger is fairly small so it spools up quicker, and the circuit length of the intake system has been kept as short as possible to maximise responsiveness. The integrated exhaust manifold allows for the exhaust gases to be used more efficiently and quickly to spool up the turbo. All of this adds up to an incredibly engaging driving experience. The small engine has plenty of grunt and accelerates hard, it enjoys being revved out but at the same time, can be driven and enjoyed sedately. The three-cylinder layout also adds in its characteristic soundtrack  a rorty note that accompanies the bump in performance rather well. All of this means that the 1-litre TSI can cater to the enthusiast, as much as it can to those that are enthusiastic about fuel economy. https://youtu.be/Q21b3y-3yvA ", 24th October 2021,skoda-kushaq,New,122,124,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

So, I don't think the companies will be surprised with this. And I feel that it would have been tough for them to double this number (say to 10000 units per month) and manage and sustain the same with their existing sales/service network (keeping the ownership experience similar or better), hence I think they went for the more pragmatic approach of over-pricing their cars so that with lower numbers that we are seeing, they can try to break even faster. [Tata seems to be making a profit of 45K per unit of vehicle sold, so you can extrapolate what VW would be making and see when they can achieve break-even point for their 8000 crore investment]. And Taigun/Kushaq is their first model from this investment and each future model (Slavia, Virtus, ...) is going to be more profitable and aid in the faster recovery of this investment. This number also help them to keep the ""halo"" around the product by publicising the ""3-4"" months wait time (which appears to be a sweet spot which a VW admirer will be ok to accept). If they had gone faster, the waiting time would be so low, which may in turn result in people dubbing these models as flop. So, the key think would be to see whether they can sustain these numbers over few years and build on top of this with new models. (I feel they should be able to do this if they can bring an upgrade immediately when the initial pace of booking starts showing some downward trends - they can draw more people by addressing some of the glaring issues in the first version ""cheap"" interiors, lack of some ""fancy"" features etc.)", 3rd November 2021,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore,43,121,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

1717, Aaroah , 17:58 ,BHPian,"Picked up the car two days back. My dealership experience was very smooth (from booking to delivery) and my SA happily obliged our request for a late-night delivery. Have taken up the extended warranty and the service pack also for peace of mind. TBH deciding between this and the Taigun was very very difficult. My LKO VW dealership denied having any allocation for the T-ROC else that would have further increased the confusion. Personally, for us, the Kushaq scored in the exterior looks departments whereas the Taigun had slightly better interiors due to the digital instrument cluster (even if it wasn't the full-fledged virtual cockpit). VW straight away gave me a 2 month waiting period for the Reflex Silver color and 4 months for the Carbon Steel color. Our Brio (which this car replaces) had done 75k kms in 9 years and was on its deathbed due to its rough use. So we wanted a car ASAP and couldn't wait for the Taigun hence decided to proceed with Kushaq. Since it will be used for doing daily chores and bumper-to-bumper duties we didn't feel the absolute need for 6 airbags in the Taigun either. The dealer had two colors in the style variant - White and Honey Orange. My family felt that they would get quickly bored of the white color so we went for the Honey Orange color. After using the car for two days I now feel that this was the right decision and the car indeed looks very graceful in this color. The dealer also gave me a very fair price for my Brio considering the condition the car was in plus gave me a 15k in exchange bonus. Taking into consideration the exchange bonus + loyalty benefits + Diwali discounts, I managed to get 50k of the quoted price. So the landed price came about 17.9L Will try to do a detailed write-up after I spend some more time with it. One thing is for sure though that it doesn't feel like a proper Skoda from the inside. It has a lot of rough edges and Creta / Seltos offer much better interior quality than this.

1728, ramgkulkarni , 20:08 ,BHPian,"My brother @SedanGuy bought Rapid in January of this year. In September, after an inspired session with my friends I decided to sell my 8 year old Swift Dzire. After a quick checkup with Cars24 and OLX autos, I sold it for way more than I expected. Suzuki Swift Dzire Model - 2013 September OTR price - INR 6,85,000 Odo - 83000 Sold - 2021 September Sale price - INR 4,15,000 Honestly If I had got 3 lakhs, i was willing to give it away. The price offered by these platforms and the huge demand for used cars ensured I received a very compelling offer. I was bummed when the car was inspected on Sunday and sold/retrieved on Wednesday. Bittersweet though! Now off to buying a new car. The excitement was off the charts but short lived though. The details of my requirements has been documented in the What car section(sedan). Link (Need a sedan! Sold my Dzire with no backup plan) Here is a brief explanation on my confusion - My requirements were so simple, yet I couldnt find a car to my satisfaction. In fact, I abandoned every one of my requirements to buy the Skoda Kushaq. 1. 4 cylinders and nothing less. 2. Also if possible, only naturally aspirated 3. Petrol engine 4. Sedan, no 4 meter cars and false sense of SUV styling (sorry don’t mean to offend anyone, I am not a fan of small/compact SUVs) 5. 4 stars or above safety ratings 6. Budget ~12 lacs with not really looking to extend Must have features: 1. Apple car play 2. Climate control 3. Nothing else really. I can live with lesser creature comforts Good to have features: 1. Keyless entry 2. Automatic wipers, they are a boon in Bangalore weather 3. Climate control with analog controls It doesnt come as a surprise that Kushaq pretty much fails in all of my requirement specification. It’s a 3 pot turbo petrol and a crossover. The AC controls are obviously not analog. No keyless entry or Auto wipers/headlamps either. You must be thinking what made me chose a car which doesnt match any of my requirement, glad you asked! I was specifically looking for a sedan and a proper one at that. Below are the cars that made the final list: 1. Honda City 4th and 5th Gen - The latter was above my budget but had decided to extend if it came to it. I did a longish test drive of the car and was thoroughly disappointed with the interior quality of the test drive car. The car had done 10/11K on the odo and the piano black was scratched all over. The interiors had kind of faded! We took our Rapid to the test drive and it felt as though the City was a downgrade in terms of the quality. There was no heft to the doors or the finesse I had expected in the car. The LED headlamps was also exclusive on the top trim. The space on offer and that engine are the best parts of the car. However, it was not meant to be. After the 5th gen, I really didn’t think 4th gen would be any different and didn’t want to take a test drive and neither was it available in Dakshin Honda at the time I visited the showroom. 2. Skoda Rapid/VW Vento - Rapid was pretty much ruled out immediately since brother had one and only Matte edition was available. I really didnt like that colour. I received some good offers on Vento but the comfortline variant(similar to Skoda's ambition variant) was unnecessarily expensive compared to Skoda. The fact that VW charges more for the same part in VW cars and Skoda was also not something I liked. Vento did pull at the heart and the torque converter 1.0 TSI was very likeable. I had actually made a deposit of 25k on the car before seeing the Taigun and Kushaq. 3. Polo GT TSI - This was simply trying to stick to budget and be happy with the best hot hatch in the country. There was no denying that the TC with 1.0 TSI is a gem of a combination. Obviously not as great as the 1.2 TSI with DSG but this is a lot more trouble-free experience. The only downside to this car was the huge waiting period. I was promptly told that it would be at least 6 months before I can get a car. One of the dealer was not ready to take the booking and was pushing me to buy a Vento which was a showroom display car(2 lakhs flat discount and the car had apparently 60 kms on the odo). It was in this brown colour that I was not a fan of either. Some of the honorable mentions that made it to the list were: 1. Hyundai Verna - the car had poor rear space and the facelifted version was not to my liking. 2. VW Taigun - The car is basically a clone of Kushaq except for the front and rear panels. This was also due to 2 month waiting period and was offering lower features compared to Kushaq Ambition variant. 3. S Cross/Ciaz - Fellow bhpians suggested to look at these but I had owned 2 MS cars already and really wanted to look outside the family for a change. Besides to build quality was a real concern despite both being GNCAP 4 star rated. Back to my question, how I bought a crossover instead of a sedan. Simply put the market doesnt offer a good one, yet! The Skoda Slavia is yet to be unveiled but I didnt have the patience to wait for it and second I was sure that the car would be more expensive than Kushaq. I had already stretched the budget to 16 lakhs and I was sure the Rapid replacement would be more expensive. Here’s a quick look at my Skoda Kushaq (RedBull, totally pun intended!) Likes- 1. Build quality - Compared to all the cars on my list, this really is built solid. 2. Interiors - I like how the interiors are dark and to my liking. There are some parts that could have been better but overall, it’s a great place to be 3. Rear space - The rear bench is equally a good place to be and is very comfortable 4. 1.0 TSI - It’s a slightly tuned version of the same engine in our Rapid. This feels a little more controlled compared to the Rapid. I think the weight might be a difference, but it feels very slightly different in the Kushaq. Nonetheless the engine is surely fun to drive. Dislike- 1. Absolutely no analog controls anywhere. There is no rotary knob on the dash for volume control. There is no button on the steering to pick up an incoming call! Didnt realize this until I bought the car. 2. Clutch - It is slightly heavier than most cars. It’s not a dealbreaker but something people need to be aware of. It does get cumbersome in stop/go traffic. 3. Skoda's limited service centers - Bangalore has only 2 service centers. I have had the car for roughly 12 days now. I have done around 200 kms and yet to take it on a proper drive. Here are a few pictures to do the remaining! The day I visited the showroom, I was floored by the colour and the lighting did the rest. We had a carbon steel Rapid, so that colour was out of the contention. Plus I wanted something bright this time around. PDI in TAFE stockyard: Day of delivery with my father. We only have a single car garage, so got the canopy installed to ensure the car is protected from the elements. Below pictures are post ceramic coating. Thats all folks!

But it is not even close to the Kicks hydraulic unit. That was on a different level. 5) Ride quality was definitely an upgrade over my Verna. The ride was mature and did not get unsettled even on deep pothole. Suspension was neither soft nor hard and came somewhat close to what I experienced in Kicks. 6) plastic quality could have been better. Switches did not feel premium for the money spent.

I adjust it to show the same time as my phone, but after a week the car clock is slower by 3 or 4 minutes. Its very irritating. Anyone else experiencing this issue? I also get a pinging sound frequently from the car while driving around. Something like a warning chime similar to a seatbelt reminder, but just a single ping. I think its played through the audio system as the music pauses for a fraction of a second to let the warning ping come through. The volume is also dependent on the entertainment system volume.

1750, AutoConsultant , 15:27 ,BHPian,"I had recently helped someone in the family make a decision on buying a mid-size SUV and they went ahead with Kushaq 1.0 L MT Style (Top variant) and I had a chance to spend some time with it. As I also had bought my 5th Gen City Petrol ZX MT earlier in this year, I just wanted to compare the two offerings. Current On-road Delhi prices are : Kushaq 1.0 L MT Style : 16.76 Lacs City Petrol ZX MT : 15.57 Lacs (I bought it in Jan @ Rs 14.7 lacs) A. Things I found better in Kushaq : Dashboard Design and Quality Although I like the minimalistic design of the City, I was really impressed by the type and quality of materials used in the Kushaq. Dark textured elements with matte finish and with minor chrome inserts give a very rich and classy feel to the cabin. Infotainment System You can actually compare Hondas ICE system with any modern car and you will find it to be very dated with limited functionality. On the other hand, Skodas display and theme is crisp and has a lot of functions which can be controlled via the ICE. Add to that the Wireless CarPlay and AA and it makes life so much easier. B. Things which are at par or can be subjective between the two : Exteriors/Stance I find Kushaqs design to be somewhere in the middle of the quirkiness of Creta and Taigun (rear styling) and the conventional designs of Seltos and Astor and one which would be acceptable to a large number of consumers. However, it does look a little compact from the outside compared to its rivals. City on the other hand is looong! The low stance does stand out in the crowd of CSUVs. The LED Headlights look sharp and brilliant but the large front chrome looks a bit overdone. There should have been a break between the bonnet and chrome like there is in the Civic. The rear looks good with the LED tail lights. Overall, I prefer Citys design over the Kushaq but this is very subjective. I liked the alloys on both the cars and felt they were enhancing the looks of the respective cars. Cabin space and Seat comfort Kushaqs stance does not give away the ample amount of interior space it offers. It has the longest wheelbase in the segment and that shows, especially at the rear. The front seats are pretty supportive and the sitting posture and seat incline angles are very comfortable at the rear. Not a big fan of the fabric texture/color combinations though, could have been a bit more sportier with darker shades in sync with the rest of the cabin. Also, the dark theme does take away the feeling of roominess from the cabin. Citys cabin with beige leather seats and large windows definitely feels much more roomier. I rate Citys front seats higher than Kushaqs although my wife felt the other way around. You get more thigh support in Citys rear bench with a lower seating position which would be the more comfortable one out of the two for long journeys. Build Quality/Fit and Finish Honestly, I didnt feel much difference between the Door thuds of both the cars. I had spent a lot of time in a 2011 Polo and I can easily say that the Polo had a much much better feel which closing the doors. The dashboard fit and finish is definitely better in Kushaq but panel gaps are easily evident at a few places in both cars. Citys rear wheel arches lack any sort of insulation and the Kushaq does not have any insulating material inside the front hood. Overall, I did not get a distinct feeling to confidently say that one car is better put together than the other. Engine Performance When I first drove the Kushaq, I felt as if the hand brake was on. Performance before the turbo kicks in is absolutely miserable. Yes, it does take some time to get used to a small Turbo engine coming from a larger NA engine but even after driving around for some time, I would take the NA i-Vtec any day. 90% of the times I like to keep a light foot on the accelerator and enjoy Citys linear power delivery. In the TSI you have to rev it up each time to get decent performance which can be very irritating during city traffic driving. The TSI would be much more enjoyable on the highways but I would spend at least 95% of my time in the car in city traffic only and hence the NA engine makes more sense. I know the TSI smashes the i-Vtec in drag races but the latter is a much better all rounder and sounds much better also. I am no expert and hence have put this in this section although I know which one I like. C. Things I find better in the City Air Con Controls and Performance Throughout my drive I couldnt get used to the touch panel controls, had to ask the co-passenger. Touch panels just do not work for me, thank god Honda made the change to physical controls for 5th gen. It is so much easier to adjust the temperature without even looking at the controls. Love the tactile feel of the knobs in the City. And its not like you will get used to the touch controls in some time (like you do with the indicator and wiper paddles inter changed), it will always remain a little irritating experience. The air con performance was also not that impressive. Even with cooled seats, it took a lot of time to cool the cabin that too during the mild winter weather in Oct here in Delhi. Also, didnt feel the actual cabin temperature and the one set in the controls were in sync, it wasnt feeling like it was 22 degrees as indicated. It is almost the other way around in the City, it feels much colder than the 28 degrees it is indicating. The cooling performance is pretty solid, although it has the Max Cool feature but I have never had to use it even in peak summers. Set it at 25 and it will max take 4-5 min to chill the cabin. The air through is powerful and nicely spread due to the large AC vents. Boot Space Kushaqs 385 Litres to Citys 506 Litres  theres nothing much to say here, but I will. I have a Baleno with 340 L boot space on paper and I felt Kushaqs boot was may be just a few inches higher but thats it. When I am buying a 17 lac car I would not want to ever think about lack of luggage storage space. It might be sufficient for weekend trips with a couple of bags but if you plan to travel with 4 travels for a week, It wont be able to take all the luggage. I went for a 10 day long trip with 4 adults and Citys boot was easily able to take 4 mid-size luggage bags along with 2 smaller ones. Citys boot is properly wide and deep and designed well to make almost all the space usable. Steering Wheel and Fog Lamps The two-spook Skoda steering wheel felt a little small and light on the hand. Lacks the chunk of Citys wheel. The music and cruise control buttons are also a bit small although you can control volume using the chrome knob (Citys knob can only be used to operate the digital instrument cluster). Also, Skoda has given halogen bulbs for fog lights which ruins the front lighting as it does not go well with the white projector headlights. Love the all-white front lighting set up in the City. Conclusion If I had to buy a CSUV today, I would still go with the Kushaq as it offers a good overall package (assuming all the niggles have been sorted out by now). The Korean twins have a big safety related question mark on them and the Astor is a fresh product from MG, the brand I do not fully trust right now. I would rather make the gamble with Skoda. If I could buy any car, I would wait for Slavia and choose one between City and Slavia. I do not like the high seating position of CSUVs and the sedans are actually offering better value for money in todays times.

If we are directly comparing both Nexon and Kushaw on basis of dimensions, Nexon definitely is more value for money. 6 lakhs more is a lot for equivalent version of the kushaq (1.0 tsi top end MT). Nexon has equally good engine and a smooth 6 speed gear box. The question is whether the buyer is ready to shell out 6 lakhs for 1. Better looks 2. Better brand image 3. Better fit and finish (supposedly) 4. Exclusivity 5. 6 airbags I know a lot of them who would not mind spending more for the looks factor alone. In my opinion, it's unfair to compare the much more fuel efficient 1.5 diesel nexon with the 1.0 tsi kushaq. Even then there is a 2.5 lakhs difference. Compare 1.5 tsi, the difference gets bigger.

Especially when all you have is what you need in a car, and not the segment. I haven't seen anyone who sets their requirements like I need C2 segment car. Some people (like me) don't even set requirements like sedan/SUV thing. Most of the CSUVs like Nexon/Venue-Sonet/XUV300 etc are very sorted cars with 90% of the features available in the next segment. Added, they also have cost advantage. So they are the obvious comparison for Creta/Seltos and Kushaq for many. In real usage, the added 30cm length is negligible. And useless for people like me whose cars usually see only 2 pax. So, next segment should make up with power or other features to convince me to shell out my money. Else it looks overpriced due to tax structure (even with company's aggressive pricing). It could also be a reason why Tata skipped the segment and jumped directly to Harrier/Safari. If you want to sell your car, you should make it stand out in current 10L+ SUV market.

The SUV is available with two engine options - a 1.0-litre, 3-cylinder TSI that makes 113 BHP and 178 Nm and a 1.5-litre, 4-cylinder TSI that puts out 148 BHP and 250 Nm. While a 6-speed manual transmission is offered as standard, the 1.0L engine gets a 6-speed automatic option. The 1.5L motor comes with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox.

One should NOT use front or rear fog lights unless visibility is seriously reduced as they dazzle other road users and can obscure your brake lights. They must be switched off when visibility improves. Fog lights are designed to be used when visibility is severely restricted, generally by fog, but also in other poor visibility conditions such as snow or heavy rain. They are designed to make you more visible, rather than helping to light your way so they are not needed in good visibility conditions at night - thats what your headlights are for. They should only be used when your car's main lights won't be enough to make you visible to other road users.", 16th November 2021,skoda-kushaq,Delhi,145,887,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

I don't think I can compare with the foggy/smoggy conditions from Delhi, so you may be right. But, my experience is from the UK and foggy/cloudy hill stations around Pune like Mahabaleshwar. Even in the olden days we used actual fog lamps with yellow coloured glass and there my experience is that fog lamps work better than your regular headlights. My Vento had aftermarket Led headlights and they just used to cause huge dispersion of light which actually used to worsen the view. As far as fog lights in non foggy condition are concerned. I don't think the beams are as focused as your normal headlights and they can produce significant glare sometimes and dazzle the on coming traffic. In the UK you can be caught by the cops and fined for using fog lights in non foggy conditions. Out here no such thing but it is not ideal.

Contrary to many in this forum, I didnt find an issue with the roofliner, it is similar to the Rapid we own. The AC unit is quite powerful, It literally gave me chills at 22 degrees. Bangalore weather helps too Coming to the issues, here you go: 1. The door seals were squeaking and making a terrible sound everytime I went over a bump or undulations. We had the same issue with our Rapid but back then the dealer asked us to clean it with Soap water but we didnt too much about it. However the Rapid's squeaking was not too prominant. I reached out to Tafe CRM and they sent a guy over with the Wurth HHS 2000. Happy to report that the squeaking is completely gone. The service person who came down did mention that it is lack of lubrication to the door seals that causes this issue and you can simply add WD40 to rectify the issue. A quick google seach does suggest Wurth HHS 2000 to be a better lubricant for door hinges and seals. 2. I find the gear switches to be a little notchy, it isnt as smooth as our Rapid. Spoke to the dealer and he has asked me to complete a few more kilometers and report back if it doesnt get smooth. Anyone else have the same issue? 3. I also find the steering to tilt every so slightly towards the left. Can notice that the car doesnt hold a straight line if i take my hands off the steering. The dealer has asked me down to the workshop and they will take a look. Although I must admit that it happened only twice to me and may be I was overthinking it at the time. To ease my mind, I plan to visit the workshop soon. Anyone who has had to change the rear wheel bearing? If anyone can suggest what are the tell tale signs of a bad rear wheel bearing.

The drive back home wasn't anything to write about - a thunderstorm and mad traffic. As for the initial and long term ownership experience, I'll post as time goes by. What I'd like to post about presently is that I decided to get an underbody coating done since I'd noted that both the Kushaq and the Taigun doesn't come with the essential underbody protection plates as one would expect from VAG. Went to my trusted Wurth detailing centre today morning and am waiting it out to get the process completed. After the underbody was pressure washed, I decided to take a peek to see what the scene was underneath. It was kind of a scary, WTH moment I would say. I think it's best that all new Kushaq & Taigun owners avoid peeping at the underbody area to avoid instant heart burn. I'll let the pics speak for themselves... I'm no automotive expert but I do believe the engine bay underside could have been better protected. The coating process doesn't apply to that area anyhow and it's hardly a job for a product of such nature. I suppose one would have to go easy on roads that maybe prone to throwing a stone chip or two to the car's underside while driving over them.

I'd agree to this perspective on new cars though I'd add that the need for an extra layer of protection largely depends on the prevailing climatic conditions where one uses/parks the car for most of it's usage period. If the area is a coastal region with salty air prevalent then it's further worth considering. Nevertheless, it's just a precaution left to one's discretion. In my case, work takes me to the hills of the Nilgiris and Kerala for most part of the car's use - both these regions have many months of heavy rains. In addition to this, my native home is very near to the coastline at Calicut and spend my time there as well. Considering these zones of usage, I've always gotten an underbody coating done for my earlier cars as well. Just thought I'll add my thoughts on how the decision to get an underbody coating should be made. But as you'd mentioned, for those who use their cars in less punishing environments, one can safely do without the extra 3k-3.5k investment.

Hey Bud, I always felt that Brio's ride quality was very choppy to start with especially around bumps and speed-breakers so Kushaq is a major improvement (Ambition variant with smaller rims will be even better). NVH levels are also noticeably better than the Brio. You just lose the chuckability of a hatchback (but that's to be expected due to the longer wheelbase) but other than that it's an improvement in every major aspect you can think of. One thing I am not so happy about is the rattles - My Brio had rattles coming out of the rear doors but in Kushaq the noise comes from the Dashboard. Brio had pretty decent quality interiors viz-a-viz its price, can't say the same for Skoda. Being a beater car the Honda was able to make it through significant abuse throughout the years but I don't see that with Skoda for sure so I am mentally prepared for the additional upkeep. Having driven a Q3 as my primary car for a few years now I strictly wanted a VAG car as my tertiary vehicle hence I never even stepped near a Hyundai/Kia dealership during my purchase. It was either the Taigun or Kushaq or maybe T-Roc. I would advise you not to commit the same mistake as me. Evaluate the Koreans strongly, they are very competent cars (esp. turbo petrol variants) that come with a lot of goodies and possess better quality interior parts. I feel there exists a big difference between VAG's indigenous and global offerings (hope they don't go the Honda way here onwards) Regarding my Brio's resale - Skoda gave me 165k + 15k (exchange bonus) making it around 1.8L. Mine was an S(MT) variant with a lot of dents and some electrical issues as well. VW quoted me 1.8L for the car but no bonus.

We booked the Kia Seltos (GTX 1.4M) in 2020 mid-pandemic, but we moved to Chennai from Mumbai once it became apparent that we would be working remote. The Kia never happened. We test drove the Compass facelift again in Chennai, but a 35L OTR for the automatic with 6 airbags felt like a LOT of money. We both love the Compass and it's a shame we will not be able to buy it. Maybe a pre-owned one in a couple of years. I was keenly looking at the Harrier and Safari - it was hard to convince the wife. Plus the Safari stories and allegedly unresponsive management were hard to swallow. We also paid the Korean showrooms a visit - super long waiting period (Creta, Seltos, Sonet) was hard to digest. Plus we didn't feel any emotional connection with the Hyundais though the interiors were super luxurious! We had an open budget and were also willing to move segments. We test drove the X3 and GLA a couple of months back. Both drove fantastic and was a MASSIVE upgrade from our humble Brio, but the overall package felt underwhelming - I guess it's either X5/GLC or nothing. The 3 was beautiful, but a sedan was out of the picture because one of the reasons we want to get a CSUV/crossover was because parents were struggling with ingress and egress in the Brio. The Brio has been struggling a lot over the last few days - the iVtec is still a gem, but the car will be a decade old next October. So no point extending the misery - we still plan to retain the Brio for grocery runs and the occasional cross-city breakfast drives. We knew we had to find a middle ground - buy a car that didn't feel overpriced and we were okay to skimp on a few creature comfort features. We test-drove the Taigun and Kushaq on Sunday - 1.0 auto. The Kushaq was marginally better inside purely thanks to the digital cockpit, but the Kushaq felt were more inviting for some reason. Kushaq also scored better on looks and some additional goodies. Here are some observations from the test drives. Both showrooms let us drive randomly with no pre-defined route - the only other such experience was with the big Germans. Surprising as many showrooms had a prefixed route. Is this common these days? Both sales people acknowledged and addressed my wife equally - a super rare occurrence - our experiences with Kia, BMW and Merc left a lot to be desired in this department. They would literally ignore her presence as if she was invisible. It is also refreshing to see women sales reps (VW and Merc both had knowledgeable and passionate women sales reps) The 1.0 auto was super punchy and fun to drive - I have never driven the TSI before and was expecting a little more than sedate driving experience much similar to the Creta 1.5 CVT. But this little motor was a joy to floor! Some sore spots like the exposed sunroof mechanicals. I hadn't noticed that in other cars, so was a little surprised. Is that a regular thing? Both had a couple of cars in stock - Skoda has the 6 airbags version in stock too, only two colours though. (I wonder how/why though) The dealer claimed there is going to be no Montecarlo version coming out for the made in India cars. Pinch of salt - he probably wanted to close the sale. I didn't mind. I wouldn't have any regrets if there were a facelift or a higher variant in the next few months - the only improvements it could possibly have would be a panoramic sunroof and the digital cockpit from Taigun/Slavia. I can live without either. They offered a cash discount of 20k for the 2 airbag version, but absolutely no discounts on the 6 airbag version since it was less than a month old. Understandable. They did offer a discount on insurance add-ons - economy (b2b, consumables etc) and elite (return to invoice) - seems like a decent offer. Haven't read through the fine print yet. Any thoughts on this? There is a discount on service pack too (16k against 25k) for the month of Nov. Dealer has promised delivery within three days of making the payment. He assured me I could visit the yard for PDI before they send the car for registration. We mentioned the A.S.S horror stories and the dealer was open about it - he said there were issues in the past, and they have come as long way in terms of service pricing transparency and training. It was probably part of Skoda 2.0 training script, but the honestly was refreshing. The service packs and extended warranty makes the giant leap of faith to the Skoda brand a little easier to justify. We are looking to wrap up financing in the next few days - negotiating with Kotak and HDFC. We are hoping to drive out a brand new carbon silver Skoda Kushaq next week!

1811, VEA , 20:59 ,BHPian,"My Kushaq 1.5 AT has done nearly 4000 kms. I was using a Corolla Altis AT before this car. Its so refreshing to drive the Kushaq after the boring NA CVT Corolla. I have been enjoying driving this car including a 1000 kms highway run which I would never have done in my Corolla. Initially, I was slightly underwhelmed with the interior quality, but now I feel its par with the segment and doesn’t bother me. I now realise that this was due to me driving my brother’s brand new Jeep Compass for around 300 kms on the same day prior to taking delivery of the Kushaq. During the first 700-800 kms I felt the engine was not revving freely or pulling proper for some reason. The car opened up after that period and now it feels like a proper TSI/DSG. The FE also improved and I consistently get around 11 kmpl in the city and 15-17 kmpl on the highway. I find the brakes excellent. Great bite and stopping power. Music system is good enough for me. I usually spend on aftermarket system and I find this on par with a spending of Rs.1.5 to 2 lakhs. Sound staging is good, but depth is not the best. No real sub bass, but goes deep enough for most music without any unwanted vibes on any panels. The tweeter is a bit bright for my liking. Headlights throws wide and long, but intensity is just satisfactory. I think most people wont be complaining. Seating position is very good for me. Seats have excellent support and I didn’t find it tiring even after 10 hours of driving on highways. Suspension on most part is satisfactory. It handles road undulations and bumps reasonably well. But it will crash with a loud thud even on medium sized potholes. Air conditioning is very effective. Its better at cooling the rear seat better than the Corolla which doesn’t have any rear AC vents. Stock wipers were bad and jumpy. Dealer offered to change it for me, but I bought an aftermarket one considering the paperwork and time taken at the dealer. Door seals are creaky when the body is stressed. I hope some lubrication will solve it. Car clock runs slow. It loses one minute every 2 days. Very annoying and I don’t know what the solution is. Cabin light switches are pathetic. There is no feedback and I am always confused if its on or off. There is no warning light to indicate low beam function. I would have liked one to know when the auto lights turn on and off. Overall I feel the car is a spacious and tall hatchback which is exactly how I like it. Skoda/VW has successfully managed to sell a repackaged Polo for 20 odd lakhs. I feel that the car is good buy for someone who values the fun to drive aspect.

1812, raghav1936 , 08:31 ,Newbie,"Hello Everyone..this is going to be my first post on team-bhp. I had to travel from Pune to Bareilly on 19-20 Nov due to some emergency and I chose to travel via road in my new Skoda Kushaq 1 L MT. I did some research on which route to take and finally decided to take pune-nashik-agra-bareilly(never travelled through this route though) route as it was shorter by 300 km than pune-vadodara-udaipur-jaipur-delhi-bareilly route. I was travelling with my wife and kid(3.5 years old). BTW, I did have some apprehensions on EPC issue occuring mid way, but I had to try it someday. I am writing this blog as I am aware that a lot of people are looking for good long distance drive reviews of Skoda Kushaq(especially the 1l engine) and how it behaves on highways considering it's a small 3 cylinder engine. Unfortunately, we were not in the best of mood to take pictures along the way, so I will just give quick written review of road and more importantly Kushaq and it's performance. Current Road Conditions: Day1: 620 km, Trip Start: 6:30 am, Trip End: 7:30 pm - Road between Pune(Wagholi) to Nashik via Pune-Chakan-Nashik highway is good. Do not take short cut between Sinnar -Chandwad as suggested by google maps, rather take the bypass just before Nashik. - Road between Nashik-Indore is good. You can easily cruise and ~90-100 and beyond. I don't drive too fast and always keep it under 100.You just need to watch out for rumblers. At one point there are a lot of them at very short distances. Day2: 850 km, Trip Start: 5:30 am , Trip End: 11:00 pm - Road between Indore - Guna-Gwalior is excellent. You will find some rough patch at Guna(maybe 10-15 kms ), but overall the road is very good and you can easily cruise at high 3 digit speeds. On this route you would find more trucks than passenger vehicles. - You will find it challenging to cross Gwalior . I bypassed it via ""Mom Ke Hanumanji - Reshampura"" road. Initial 2 kms or so is bad patch and rest is new road(from wrong side though, no traffic here). I initially went via google maps option which takes you from within the city which was very crowded, so I took U turn and took above bypass. - From Gwalior to agra , road is ok, you might not be able to go over 70 kmph due to chaotic driving/rush all around. You will also notice a sudden dip in road discilpline on this patch and beyond. - Agra(bypass)-Tundla-Etah-Kasganj-badaun(bypass)-Bareilly stretch is very good. The road between Tundla and Etah is two way so driving at night can be a chellenge. Overall the road condition is good. I would say 7/10. How did the Kushaq perform? - Since it's a new vehicle(registered on 30th Oct 2021) and was just driven 500 kms before going on this trip, I did not want to rev it harder for initial 1500 or so kms. So, kept it mostly under 3000 rpms and speed within 100. When cruising at 100kmph on 6th gear , it's at 1900 rpm and feels relaxed. - First and foremost, I thoroughly enjoyed the drive. It's ride quality, performance and handling is great. Its planted well on the road and gives you confidence to switch lanes or go at faster speeds. On one patch I did go to higher 3 digit speeds for a short span and never felt that the engine is exhausted. - I have seen many reviews about it's steering being lite at higher speeds. Let me tell you that it does weigh up sufficiently to give you confidence and I found it very balanced.Steering feedback is also very good. - Body roll is minimum while cornering at high speeds. - During overtakes, you will sometimes have to shift down and rev harder. I sometimes felt, wish it had little more power/torque. It could possibly be due to me not revving harder enough. Will update on this on my return trip. - At speed on very bad roads or high bumps you will find noise entering the cabin, but suspension tuning is good and you will still be planted and not thrown here and there. - Brakes are awesome. Does not nose dive due to small engine. - For the entire trip of ~1500 kms, the mileage was 18.9 kmpl. I did get ~ 23kmpl on some stretches where I was cruising at 100/6th gear for a longer period. In city traffic mileage will drop down to 10-13 kmpl depending on the traffic density. From Pune to Indore stretch I used Shell normal petrol and between Indore - Bareilly I used HP power. Issues: - I too faced the cabin noise due to door rattle on bad patches from the very next day of getting the vehicle. I had applied fellow BHPian d_himan's fix (link below) and the rattle did reduce drastically(I would say >95 %). Thanks to him for this amazing solution. I did try silicone lube spray from 3M, but it did not work. https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/diy-d...r-rattles.html (DIY - VW Polo/Vento: Getting rid of Door Rattles) - Android Auto was also disconnecting very frequently. My phone is not compatible for wireless android auto connection, so I used cables. I am not sure if it disconnects due to phone, wire, car or AA itself. Anyhelp, on this would be appreciated.

Cost cutting is there and I dont deny that. I dont see a problem with the roof liner as its hardly ever touched or seen (as far as im a concerned). Ive hardly ever noticed the roof liner on my polo in the last 7 years. Now when Kushaq liner was shown, I squeezed my 2014 GT TSI to check and it seemed to be as squishy as the demo Kushaq car. The problem I see are with the the aircon vent on the sides; flimsy controls for airflow! Second, the motors on the power windows. They are noisier and slower than Polo window motors. Rest of cost cutting are not apparent for daily usage. All the daily/regular touch points are as per VAG Global car standards and there is no perceptible change in quality. Hence, I have decided to go on with the booking as these dont hamper my daily usage (I am mostly with auto ac on due to dust and outside pollution - so windows closed for 90% of drives in last 7 years).

1835, nickelniks , 23:57 ,BHPian,"Hello fellow petrol heads, I have been largely silent member of the T BHP community. Ever thankful for the detailed reviews & the ownership experiences. I currently drive a i20 1.2 Petrol, while I know it is not a car for driving pleasure, my 8 years of ownership have been fantastic & memorable. I never felt the need for an upgrade as all the cars I test drove did not seem to be offering anything substantially more than my i20 which has all the feature I need. This was until I took a test drive of Kushaq 1.5 DSG today. I am super impressed to say the least. The ride quality over bad roads, power & handling are easily class leading. The moment you floor the pedal it is pure ecstasy. I do not see any issue with the flimsy roof liner of AC vents, when the main aspects of ride, handling, power & safety are so well taken care of. I am ready to put my my down & get a carbon steel 1.5 DSG home ASAP, only problem being wife is not too happy with the interiors. Feeling that they feel cheap & cramped.

Seltos is a great car , but the ride is abysmal compared to Kushaq. Interior space is not remotely a challenge in the Kushaq as long as you are going max 4+1. Nor is quality (none in this segment have soft touch interiors across the board). I feel the interior design is sophisticated enough, but Seltos is better. All versions of Creta except the top end has the same blue highlights as the i10 ! And the ACC is hideous - so the Creta went out of my consideration set there itself ( even if I ignore the disconnected exterior design) But this is nitpicking - all three are great cars for urban environments. If you are going for the top end versions, Seltos and Creta might be better value (especially if you are not gunning at every redlight).

Considering your love for the driving experience let me suggest something thats very off beat. Try out the Nissan Kicks XV 1.3 Turbo either CVT or MT. At 154Bhp and 254 Nm Torque its is a really great powerful drive. NVH levels are unbelievable and suspension beyond belief smooth. The cons are that its feature list is a bit outdated. Has everything that youd sensibly require but no glitz like Sunroof or Ventilated seats. Interiors are nice though not stand out. Take a TD and fall in love with its power, smooth and silent drive. If you want a modern powerful car go with the Kushaq at 113bhp power and 178nm torque The Koreans arent the only alternative to the Germans even though the Japanese are not trying to have any day in that battle. I am today going to TD the 1.0 AT Style once again after August. At that time I wasnt aware of the Kicks. I already have a booking in place for a Sonet GTX+ D-AT, which with every passing day Im more inclined to cancel. So now Im stuck between a contemporary but slightly underpowered Kushaq, relatively of course and a not at all popular, dated but superb powerful driving machine in the Kicks. Just cannot make up my mind which to go for. Incidentally the Kushaq 1.0 Style AT is going for a good discount ₹18.0 L net On Road Mumbai for the 2 airbag version and & ₹18.70 L on raod Mumbai for the 6 airbags+ TPMS version. Thats super pricing I think. The Kicks after all discounts is ₹17.0 Lac OTR Mumbai for the XV Pre 1.3 CVT, just to give a comparison.", 28th November 2021,skoda-kushaq,Mumbai,91,106,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

1849, shipnil , 15:27 ,BHPian,"During last couple of weeks, I decided to do a dekko of Taigun / Kushaq. I have a 2011 Figo D, so there is some itch to buy a new car. First I started with Taigun, after reading the reviews of Team-Bhp. The Taigun looked good overall from outside but I too did not like the overdone chrome on the front or the long LED strip on the rear. On the inside, I felt the grey painted inserts too much. Could be due to the fact that my current ride, Figo has lot of silver inserts on the central console and AC vents. As for hard plastics, they were not a turn off to me, possibly because I was comparing it with my current car. I think it matters what car you ride currently when you evaluate any new car. Steering wheel design, I did not like very much. I have test driven Vento couple of years back and that steering wheel was a nice looking to hold. I think it is not just Taigun but all new VW cars are sporting similar looking steering wheels. I saw few youtube videos of Tiguan and there too the same design was there. Due to the overdone chrome and in general the view of dash from drivers perspective, I did not feel like taking a TD as the car did not appeal to me much. Then decided to check out Kushaq. The impressions were quite opposite. The car looked nice from outside and in team-bhp parlance, proper ""European"". No overdose of chrome or LED lights. On the inside, the dark theme on the dashboard was better looking compared to Taigun. Yes, the analog dials looked plain but contrary to popular opinion, the two spoke steering wheel looked rather good. Compared to thick grey plastic inserts on the Taigun, this one had thin chrome inserts around the black spokes. The view of dashboard overall is better in Kushaq compared to Taigun, IMHO. As for switches, like the power windows or the light, they looked okay but this I am saying from the perspective of owner of 11 year old Figo. I took test drives in Kushaq of 1.0 AT and 1.5 AT. As written earlier, I had taken a test drive of Vento TSI DSG couple of years' back and it was ride to remember, so mind was comparing against that. Although 1.0 is a good unit, it did not feel fast. Next I tried 1.5AT. As expected this was fast. It had nice quick linear acceleration. But it did not have the sudden shove in backseat that I felt during the Vento test ride. I also took the car on broken roads and the ride was good. Overall I came out impressed with the car thinking I'd book it if there are any December offers. The SA said only corporate discount of about 15k is there. I can buy insurance from outside if I like to save some money. I also had this feeling that I should at least give a look to Creta, the crowd favorite. Hence I dropped into a Hyundai showroom. First of all they were in the middle of some associates birthday celebration. It was about to start. So there was no one to acknowledge my presence. I approached the front desk and asked if I can see Creta. She said, they don't have any and if I want to see she'll try to show some customers' Creta that might be there for servicing. I was okay but then she directed me to an SA. He was least interested and just asked what I want to know. I said I can get details online but want to see the vehicle. He said none available and I left. They were not interested in calling me back or anything. So just to give another try, I requested test ride on Hyundai website who shared my details with another local dealer. He too just called once but no progress further. He was just asking me when I am going to book even without showing the car. I think till the time the huge waiting is there, they don't need any new customers. Coming back to Kushaq, fellow members who booked it or already received it, what offers have you got, if any? Are there any offers for December?

From a safety point of view, it makes no sense. I dont understand the half baked regulations that are bought into irritate the aam junta. Anyway after searching for information on coding, we were able to connect with a VW/German car coding specialist on instagram - https://instagram.com/drcodemyvw (please note we are not associated with the person running the account and this is just for others to explore it if required) After reading through some of his customer testimonials and his long list of car codings, we were ready to take the leap. I will cover the Kushaq coding here and how it has changed the cars dynamics. Luckily the business owner shipped over a cable which can be connceted to your OBD2 port and computer and he can then remotely update the ECU. The following changes were done: 1. Removed the warning chimes for 80/120 KMPH 2. Improved torque vectoring with XDS 3. Dynamic mode activated for better steering feel The following changes are noticed immdeiately after the changes: 1. The steering has definitely weighed up. Its still not your typical german car level but it is a lot better now. My comparison is my brother's Rapid and that is still the better steering in terms of feedback but the dynamic mode has made Kushaq better than before. 2. Torque vectoring changes were also made to reduce understeer. However what I have noticed is the throttle response have become better. The car is now holding up in second gear on speedbumps. Its made a change in city driving conditions for the better. This might be because of the dynamic mode too! The speed warning is now a welcome change as it was more of an irritant than a deterrent. There were some other options available for coding like making 5 clicks on lane change indicator which I wasnt really interested in. Also another option was add in sounds for lock/unlock which is another thing that I was not interested in. A break assist feature could have been coded too but this means an upgrade to the break system would be needed to avoid heating the breaks. So this wasnt opted too. I am planning a long trip in December, will test the Kushaq's abilities. Daily reminder of why we love these machines. A pic while coding was going on.

Coming to the point of concern, these are the ones getting replaced So off they came and in went the new ones. The feel of the rubber on the new ones is way better, they have the rubbery sticky feel when you run your finger on them, whereas the old ones had a more slippery feel to them; may be that was the reason it was squeaking. Anyways, Škoda got themselves and me covered under warranty. Here are some more photos in the workshop. The majority of the cars in for service were Octavia and Superb. Also, I saw one blue vRS tuned to stage 4, carbon fibre intake, wing mirror, ceramic brakes etc. point being it was drool worthy. However, since it was being worked upon and dusty, didn’t feel like taking a photo and doing injustice to the beast So after the door seals were put in place.

1908, msnarain , 13:23 ,BHPian,"Took delivery of our new koda Kushaq 1.0 Style AT (6 airbags) on Saturday. We have driven it for close to a 100 km over the weekend. It's been an absolute joy to drive - so much that the wife and I have literally been fighting over who gets to drive the car - we have now resorted to rock, paper, scissors! I will try to write a detailed review one of these days, but here is a quick gist. What we like Looks - we love it. Surprisingly been turning heads - probably because there are not many Kushaqs on the road. Driving. The TSI + the torque convertor is an absoltue joy. Been resisting the temptation to floor for at least a couple of thousand kms. Handles beautifully. Super refined ride quality too in the city. Will update highway manners post a long highway drive. Sedan like manners. For someone coming from a hatch that was an absolute toy to chuck, this seems like the perfect upgrade. Not too hard to navigate through traffic or take that tight U-turn. We love the dashboard and steering. Classy and not too loud. Every thing visible to the driver is extremely usable, accessible and thought through (except the AC controls - more on that below) Back seat - parents love the easy ingress and egress after having been struggling with the Brio for a couple of years now. Three in the back seems like a squeeze, but the middle occupant won't complain for city drives considering there is an adjustable head rest for middle seats. We don't plan to take on a third occupant for long drives, unless it's someone we really hate. 6 airbags. We had to shoot down a lot of good CSUV/crossovers within (Magnite, Kiger etc) because they lacked 6 airbags. This almost single-handedly sealed the deal for us. The other SUV/CSUV/Crossovers with 6 airbags that we could buy for less than 20L were either too old models (Ecosports etc) or commanded waiting periods that didn't make sense (all the South Koreans) What we aren't big fans ofAnalog cockpit that looks dated. No complaints, but we would have loved the digital cockpit considering cars priced way below seem to offer better looking MIDs and needles. Not complaining about the analog rev meter though. I absolutely hate the digital rev display in my Triumph Street Twin. Unusable. Non-powered seat adjustment. Plus the passenger seat can't be adjusted for height. Exposed sunroof mechanicals are an eyesore. Luckily, I don't see us opening it ever. AC controls are all-touch. Had to take my eyes off the road for split-seconds multiple times. Cabin is really noisy. A lot of engine + traffic noise makes its way into the cabin. The powered windows are WAY noisy as well. Few more pointsWe haven't setup MySkoda yet, so will not comment on that yet. No squeaky door issues so far - SA promised they have taken care of it before delivery and said if it arises, they will take care of it again. Oct 2021 is the manufacturing month. So they SA claims the fuel pump is also replaced. The 3-cylinder clatter seems amplified at idle. So much that someone mistook it for a diesel. But super refined once you drive off. But you still hear the engine inside the cabin. Can one go for after market insulation under the bonnet to at least contain some of the noise? I will post more pictures and write a detailed review here soon. Brb for now, got to go win a game of rock, paper, scissors!

It is common practice by dealer to ask full payment including RTO charges upfront as most of the customer do not insist or care about PDI and just ok to see the car for the first time on the delivery day.

Yes, in respect of pre delivery inspection, it is recommended that you have a look at the car and make sure that all parts are ok (no scratches or rusting) and working (some may not be working as they are locked by factory prior to workshop PDI), note the VIN and then give the go ahead to the sales advisor to give you the invoice and then you make full payment (down payment, loan etc as the case may be) including car cost, insurance, road tax amongst others.

1976, NikhilosKage , 10:12 ,BHPian,"New user here. First post! Booked a Skoda Kushaq 1L MT Ambition variant yesterday from TAFE Skoda, HSR Layout, Bangalore. Got the Carbon Steel color. I have been told that delivery will be provided by the coming Saturday with the PDI and loan formalities scheduled for Thursday Choosing the car Initially, I wanted to get the Slavia. I thought of taking a test drive of the Kushaq before booking the Slavia. I ended up loving the Kushaq and there were year-end discounts on offer. So decided to go with either the Kushaq or Taigun. I loved driving the Taigun a little more than the Kushaq (maybe because the test-drive car was comparatively new). Both are fun-to-drive cars with brilliant handling and a good suspension. Both the wife and I fell in love with the Curcuma Yellow of the Taigun. However, the decision towards Kushaq was swayed by the heavy discounts provided. I got the Kushaq for approx 90k less than what I would have had to pay for the Taigun. Test Drive Impressions Coming from a first-gen i10, the ride, power delivery, handling and overall balance of the car was just amazing. Not really a comparison to be honest. I did not feel a lot of difficulty driving the car even while wading through bangalore traffic which was a big plus. The car scored 5/5 on most parameters for us. A few misses were noticed thoughHeight adjustability for the rear seat. Looks weird with both seats at different heights Middle seat has been compromised on to provide for a better experience in the other two seats Some plastics felt cheap Engine noise does filter into the cabin Color choices could have been better (probably the Curcuma Yellow effect) Verdict Loved the car and booked it. Looking forward to spending a lot of my time inside this beauty. I would also like to thank all of you for helping by providing your experience and knowledge.

For fuel economy you can read this thread backwards, many members who own kushaq have reported fuel economy figures. On highway the engine is efficient, many people have reported consumption figures of 18-20 kmpl. But still it varies from person to person, your speed, how fast you accelerate, no of stops, Road conditions, ac use etc. But when we are talking about bumper to bumper condition, it's always going to be under 10 kmpl, users can give you accurate data here.

2027, Trapezio , 12:33 ,BHPian,"We went on a 700km drive with friends on the Kushaq 1.0 TSI Style Manual transmission. We were five adults with a full load of luggage including beverages - the car was loaded to the brim. We drove across the city, 300km highway and around 20kms through broken roads. Here are my thoughts: Excellent engine/gearbox combination. I should explain this a bit. There are moments when the 1.0L TSi did struggle a little on the highway. But these are actually not so frequent. The best part is that the integration is so good that it is fairly fun to explore the engines' limits. Sure the noise does increase at high RPMs, but the 1.0TSi delighted with its character. It is definitely faster than most cars that you would encounter on your highway drive. Interiors are quite pleasing and have a little Germanic feel with their layout. The sound system is quite nice and was quite competitive across various genres. The MM is also quite modern, smooth, and slick to touch. The same mature, European feel is carried over in the interface. Once you settle down at a comfortable pace, it was a pleasure to listen to the speakers. The car feels fresh! This to me is a big plus Excellent storage all around with huge leg space. We, five adults, had no issues keeping our wallets, phones, drinks, etc. 2nd-row width is limited. If five full adults' long drive is a priority, this would be an issue. With sedate driving 100-120kmph on highways and moderate city driving we clocked ~15kmpl with a full load - 5 adults + luggage. Skoda doesn't seem to have skimped on the basics - suspension is stable and predictable. At very high speeds it stood out by its stability and holding the line. The ride was good too. So, well balanced it is in driving dynamics. Around the tight turns, it is a little hatch-like with stable predictable behavior. Nice! In all, this car has a lot to love in it. It is a pleasure to drive, is quite practical to use, has nice audio, well-sorted dynamics, elegant styling, etc. In this ocean of Suzuki/rebadged avatars and Korean cousins, this car clearly is as competitive as the best in its segment with a refreshing Skoda take on things.

2028, kirans , 15:51 ,BHPian,"Took the test drive of Kushaq 1.0 MT last weekend. Some questions still linger from the test drive experience. I felt that the throttle response was not very refined, there was a reluctance in the engine to pull along. There were three people in the car, and the drive was in full traffic (as I prefer since the usage will be only in the city for work commute). The engine felt better at higher RPMs in a relatively free'er stretch, but in the typical Bangalore traffic, it did feel inadequate. I felt that I had to constantly switch between 1st and 2nd gears in traffic. Secondly I went over a few bad patches very gently and a few others a little harsh, as one might inadvertently do over normal usage. There was a significant thud over a few potholes, and while I never really misuse any of my cars, this thud from was a little concerning. So my questions are - Is the 1.0 MT adequate in the city traffic conditions and will it lug along in 2nd without riding the clutch? Was this perhaps just the state of the test car. How is the suspension in real world conditions? Given that none of the roads will get better for a while at least, I expect that my cars will go through the bad patches for a year or more while all the ""white-topping"" is done.

2032, KapilD , 11:19 ,BHPian,"1.5 TSI STYLE MT 800 KM update The car has a very good road manner and im beginning to appreciate it more and more. The experience so far in brief is as under: The car can easily potter around the city in 3rd gear from 15-45 kmph without playing the clutch. So I find the drivability very good. Once the 500 odd km was achieved, I find that the engine goes into Eco mode more frequently. So I guess the engine has settled in a bit. I see it in 2nd, 3rd and 4th gear in the city. Any higher gear and the rpm drops below the 1400 mark: so no ACT in city in 5th The mileage has increased from 9 kmpl to 11 kmpl over these 800 kms with an average speed of 20 kmph, which I find is acceptable. It should increase more once I add more miles to it. There is no door squeaking any more after the rubber beading were changed. So I guess its production issue is sorted. I find it easier to go at a higher speed over the road imperfections. The slower I go the more it sways. So, slowly my bad road tackling speed is increasing but I dont know if its a good thing for the suspension.

Hence took it to Guindy service centre. They had actually made some adjustments to the beading post which the sound has completely disappeared. Now the cabin is super quiet. Completed 2000 KMs. Below are few observations. - it's a definite looker. Have had people smiling and checking out the car. - Oodles of space at the back. Very comfortable seats as well. - Build quality is superb. No rattles whatsoever. - outstanding handling and ride quality. Highway stability is superb. It is never unsettling. - that 1.5 pulls like a loco. Never experienced shortage of power or torque at any point in time. - AC is quite good. Chills the cabin in no time - Service response is good and proactive here in Chennai. Excellent follow up as well. - quite efficient with fuel consumption as well. Coupled with that 50 litres tank it aids in touring. - boot is designed very well to hold full family luggage. - 120 kmph comes at 2500 rpm feels very relaxed. Masks speed very well. Now for negatives: - Width is narrow. So it is really a comfortable 4-seater. - noisy power windows and ORVM operation. - 2nd gear is bit shorter. So have to move quickly to 3rd gear for ambling around in city. - Have to keep the rpm above 1300 for comfortable driving. Below that there is a pronounced lag. - the reverse camera quality could have been better. - I have to take my eyes of the road to adjust AC and touchscreen settings. No buttons on steering to pick and cut calls as well. Not cool at all. - suspension is on the harder side. It literally crashes in potholes. Very uncomfortable. Overall a great package.

It was a breeze to drive the Seltos in the city, slightly better driveability than the Kush 1.0, and the iMT was super convenient. When it comes to acceleration, Kushaq was way ahead, but the Seltos 1.5 is no slouch either, it was sufficient for city use. And ofcourse the Seltos was more refined, and considerably less noisier. The Kushaq 1.0 roars when you push it, it's more a of a love it or hate it kinda thing. I personally loved it! Mileage wise, Seltos returned around 12.5kmpl, and Kushaq around 11kmpl, for the 8km test drive. (Please note, I pushed the Kushaq harder) And all of these tests were done with a driver and a front seat passenger. So, the experience may vary based on load. It all comes done to what you need out of the engine, if it's pure family usage, and you aren't that enthusiastic a driver, the Seltos 1.5 NA would be a good fit!

2055, mohankarthik , 13:10 ,Newbie,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Big thanks to this thread and many others to help me make the decision to take the Kushaq. Got my Carbon Steel 1.0AT Style 6 AirBags yesterday. HistoryI've had a 17 year old Alto (2005) model that has lasted exceptionally well so far. With FC expired, I thought it was a good time to get a new car. I really wanted an Electric, but after a lot of deliberations thought that's a bridge that can be crossed later once more infra pops up. Research Process RequirementsSafety Good ground clearance for Bangalore roads. But at the same time did not want the car to be too high so my parents / in-laws find it difficult to ingress/egress. Highway and ride comfort (mostly going to be Work from home) Automatic (so it's less of a barrier for wife to take the car) OptionsSeltos got ruled out right away thanks to 3 star All new CityEven though GC was lower, I had to try it out. And it was heaven. The car + CVT made for one of the smoothest ride of my life. The interiors are premium and makes you feel amazingly special. But even during the TD, I was so worried of hitting bumps / potholes and after some reflection decided that Sedan wasn't the fit for us. CretaThe rear seats were really awkward to sit and both me and my wife started getting back discomforts during a 30min test drive. This was the big red alert. The car didn't feel responsive enough (DCT). Although wanted to try the Turbo Torque Converter, but never did. The interiors looked a little meh 6AB was very pricy (22L+) AstorThis was close. We really liked the interiors and the drive (CVT) The ADAS was a big hit and a miss The AI assistant sort of freaked out my wife Music system was fantastic! TaigunThe DSG drive was OK, but the 1.0 TC's drive was amazing. The car responded beautifully to any throttle inputs. The interiors were very rustic and solid The exterior was OK. Both me and wife didn't feel too connected with it. The music system was meh without the sub-woofer. KushaqThe drive feel was the same as the Taigun (duh!) The interiors with it's analog cluster was amazing. Both me and wife are a fan of retro, so this sort of clicked for us. Even the A/C vents look gorgeous, and the chrome inserts around the touch screen. Music system was out of the world The interior work was blowing us away Buying Process Booked the Kushaq at Raja Skoda, Whitefield, Bangalore and surprisingly the vehicle was ready in 3-4 days. This is big thanks to the SA (Naresh). He recommended and suggested ways to cost cut and choose cheaper / effective options where possible. Another interesting story was that the car was at Mysore showroom and the Raja Skoda manager wanted to drive the car to Bangalore. I was very hesitant about this and requested Naresh to help. He pushed hard and got a flatbed arranged to get the car to Bangalore. I got the car with 10km on the Odometer. Got a 37k discount at Insurance by sharing quotes from other vendors like Acko / HDFC Ergo. Took the 4 year service plan at 15,999, but did not opt for extended warranty as I could take it up later at the end of 4 years. The PDI / PRI checklist from Team-BHP was a huge boon and the SA was amused and impressed with the detail of checks. Also learnt a lot in terms of how to jump start, etc... Drive Experience Already have driven 100km in one day yesterday. Some observationsNo door rattles or A/C whines / ventilated seat noises so far. It's been silent and cool The car jumps off as soon as the brake is off which may be a little tricky for my wife, and in 2nd is a lot slower since it's RPM is sitting lower than 1800. But on any gear, once it hit 1800, it's a smooth smooth ride. I've been keeping it around 2k RPM now since it's running in, so haven't tried out higher yet. The suspension / tire pressure is on the harder side right now, so I can feel all the potholes on the road. Looked at upgrading to UC6, but thought let me try it out for sometime and then decide. Seats are super comfy and relaxed Steering is a little too light (excellent for city, but at higher speeds, a little more weight would have been nicer) Driving in the middle of the night with sunroof open, AC/DC basting off the speakers with cruise control on is godly good The music system is amazing and so is Android Auto. Infotainment screen is really slick and Google assistant gets my commands pretty well More than adequate seating space all over Reverse cameras could have been better and guidance could have been added. It's such a silly miss. Will post a bigger review later after I've done about 1K km.

Well, it was more of a feeling, and I don't have too much experience with a lot of cars, so this could just be my naivety, but this was my impressionIt was a lot more comfortable to weave through traffic with the TC than with the DSG. The TC responded faster when I peddled down giving me power for quick overtakes. It ""felt"" a lot more similar to driving in manual where I'll downshift and revv for a quick overtake than the DSG. And when I floored the pedal on the TC in sport mode, it just shot out like a bullet, the DSG felt that it was slightly slower off the mark. The DSG felt like it was gradually accumulating power and then gave me a much bigger overall output, but took longer to reach there. Like the slope was lower, but the final output was higher. The DSG felt like it was between a CVT and the TC in terms of responsiveness. It felt more smooth but also more gradual. If I had not experienced the TC, I would have still loved the DSG btw. It felt amazing when I first drove it. But after driving the TC, it just felt a perfect fit for how I liked to drive. The DSG's reliability was playing on my mind too in the decision in a big way btw.", 28th December 2021,skoda-kushaq,Bengaluru,2,30,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Some of the deliveries from August batches were the ones that brought bad experiences for their owners - notably, the infamous EPC errors. So that surely is good enough reason to wait it out for just another week or two more and get your newest acquisition from a latest batch.

Due to semi conductor shortage many manufacturers were continuously manufacturing vehicles without the semi conductor bits and built an inventory. And when they receive these components the cars which were manufactured some months before gets fitted with the missing parts and gets shipped for delivery. You have 4 years of standard warranty and an option of extended warranty as well, so don't worry much, instead of waiting for 3-4 months or a year in case of some manufacturers for delivery, it's better to get instant delivery of your vehicle. There are so many suppliers and so many components which gets manufactured months before the car gets assembled/manufactured, and we don't get to know about their manufacturing dates. So just do a proper PDI in good light, take some friends along to inspect the car properly and enjoy your car.

I could've waited till next week but with a business trip coming up on the 3rd and that beading noise becoming very loud - I just wanted to get it over with. Anyways, while I was there I found out that the recent batches come with the softer door beadings factory fitted. That was good to know. There was also a mild rattle from somewhere within the dashboard (only on bad roads) and I reported this as well. They heard it too when we went for a quick test drive before preparing the job card entry. For this, they didn't have a clue as to what could be the cause. It's something they'll have to probe & find out. I'm hoping I'll be rid of it when I get the car back tomorrow. So my advice of just waiting up for an extra week or two (as he'd mentioned) to get a delivery from a recent batch was for avoiding these kind of scenarios - it's no fun buying a new car and having to get it sorted out under warranty. If the waiting period is much longer, then it's his call. You're spot on about the semiconductor shortage causing differences in manufacturing and invoicing dates though.

There was also a rattling noise from the dashboard console and this has been solved as well. They'd written 'console trim removal and re-fitment' in the job card closure details. Upon enquiry, the manager explained the it was a wire tie that was rattling against the dash inner. Being pressed for time thanks to a project deadline, I zipped back home and left the car untouched till yesterday evening. It was then that I found both the rear windows travel with considerable resistance after about three-quarters upwards. I very rarely roll down the windows while driving within the city limits, so I was oblivious to this on my drive back. Somehow it didn't occur to me to roll the windows up and down at least once during the TD or before leaving the SVC. The TD was done with the windows up, AC off and a short drive with all our focus on the door beading & dashboard. The left side rear window sends out quite a bit of creaking noise while closing. The right side one suffers silently. Along with this setback, this was also found: Note the clarity through the right rear window Lube not cleaned off the inner felt beading = greasy glass pane of the left rear window The strained window travel might require only a re-alignment of the beadings there and the lube can be cleaned off of course, but requires removing the door panel.

Did around 800Kms overall. Listing out some points observed,On the highways with good roads, it was a bliss to drive. The ride is almost perfectly balanced, and it was a delight to take the curves at high speeds (it just remains planted all the way through). No shortage of power and torque, pulls in any gear (provided you're above 1400rpm) On the hills the 1.5 really came in handy. It managed most of the roads effortlessly on 2nd and 3rd gears. Only in some very steep curves/slopes, had to drop in to the 1st. It performed better than the 1.5 Honda TD I used to drive before I realized for the first time that the MT also comes with Hill-Hold. It made the drive on hills so much more convenient and stress-free After riding diesels extensively, the NVH levels of the 1.5Tsi was scarily quiet. It made the highway experience so much more relaxing The car takes on bad patches and small potholes with ease, and glides through, without a change in composure The audio system was great. It has a nice sound stage, good bass (a bit boomy). Only the rear speakers lack the punch (planning to replace them with my old Alpine coaxials) Some bad bits,The car crashes into some mid sized and large potholes with a thud (Even with the UC6 there is not much improvements here) Door Rattle/squeak - It got so bad over the course of the trip. Luckily the audio system was able to mask it to a good extent. (SVC has agreed to replace the beading after I took them on a TD) There might be some dash rattles as well, but hard to isolate because of the door rattles (will look at it more keenly after fixing the door rattles) Had some niggles with wireless Android Auto couple of times, where it would just fail to connect, no matter we do. And then starts to work magically the next time I turn the ignition on Some pics from the property I stayed at. It got super foggy/misty on the last 2 days of the trip.

It is recommended that you get it done from a reputed tyres dealer (with right equipment which doesn't scratch your alloy) right after you get the car from the dealer. The more miles you put on the tyre the lesser you get in exchange. Of course, you can buy extra alloy and tyre, given your storage space in the garage.

However, I have begun to realise that a darker shade just masks the size of the car and conceals the character lines, haunches, cuts and creases of the sheet metal. To me silver is the top color which brilliantly pronounces the aforementioned attributes. Yes, I have seen a Kushaq in silver shade but during a rainy, dusky evening. It is the most beautiful shade in a Kushaq I believe! That luster from the paint coupled with the powerful DRL had a very tranquil effect. Apart from that, it is not the silver you see on Marutis', this one belongs with that shade of W212 E-class (strictly my opinion).

Sigh... By yesterday morning, these niggles started getting to me. Bypassing the SVC representative who I was in connect with, I made a call directly to the service manager at SGA Skoda, Coimbatore. My primary questions: why were the door beadings still squeaky after a full replacement and would it better to wait for an improved batch of beadings instead of a second replacement job presently? I'd also mentioned the other niggles that were induced thanks to their shoddy workmanship from my last visit to them. Was expecting the usual 'bring the car over, sir and we'll will surely rectify everything' but to my surprise, this happened... The chubby gentleman turned out to be a Fiat Punto fan & we got along together very well indeed Didn't expect them to reset the window guides right then & there...was kind of painful to watch. They found out that the door beading replacement wasn't done with the latest version (GEN03S) - whoever worked on it earlier, merely put in a new set from the first version again (GEN01S). So the car will have to go back the SVC later to get the latest version. Well, at least now I know that things will get sorted out finally. The mechanic was very polite. I found it funny but kind of him to forewarn me that he'll have to hand thump the beadings back into place. 'Don't mind, okay saar?' The windows rolled up & down smoothly now. The dashboard & the door panel rattle will have to be checked out at the SVC later, they said. So the clean up was done and quite thoroughly too, I must say The mechanic then decided to take a quick look what was causing the door panel rattle...but he couldn't figure it out. So that was added to the list for the SVC visit after 16th. Final inspection by the gentlemen and overall, they did a good job. A few more minutes of talk about the Punto and the chaps left - leaving a happy customer to grab a cup of his evening tea.

I'd also mentioned the other niggles that were induced thanks to their shoddy workmanship from my last visit to them. Attachment 2256549 The mechanic was very polite. I found it funny but kind of him to forewarn me that he'll have to hand thump the beadings back into place. 'Don't mind, okay saar?' Attachment 2256551 The windows rolled up & down smoothly now. The dashboard & the door panel rattle will have to be checked out at the SVC later, they said. So the clean up was done and quite thoroughly too, I must say Attachment 2256552 The mechanic then decided to take a quick look what was causing the door panel rattle...but he couldn't figure it out. So that was added to the list for the SVC visit after 16th. Attachment 2256553 Final inspection by the gentlemen and overall, they did a good job. A few more minutes of talk about the Punto and the chaps left - leaving a happy customer to grab a cup of his evening tea. I'm not sure if this 'doorstep service' is a Skoda SOP or if it had something to do with the fact that SGA Cars had won the 'Icon of the Year' award among the local businesses last year. Whatever it is, this kind of pampering certainly helps the customer feel like their cars are in better hands. Oh well! All that begins ""mediocre"" ends well I guess.

2142, ladha.deepak , 16:23 ,Newbie,"Guys, Though there is a surge in Kushaq sales numbers last month (maybe a year-end effect though), the action on this thread seems to be waning. Just my observation! Well, after a long wait, I decided to buy another car and started taking test drives. Finally, I decided to go ahead with Kushaq Ambition 1.0L TSI MT variant (felt a little low on power though). I wanted to go ahead with the booking in December but then it got delayed because not all the colors were available and I wanted to personally check out all before finalizing on one. I was informed that Silver and Grey colors were not readily available as those were slow-moving. Though the dealer had the year-end offers running, I decided to delay my booking. Then the new year happened. Around 11-12 Jan, I called up the sales rep to enquire about the availability of the 2022 batch Kushaq. I was told that it was not certain (I was a little surprised). When I asked how long it could be, I was told that it could be Feb end for 2022 batch cars to start arriving at dealers. I also gathered that there were just a few cars (2021 make) left at the plant itself for the Ambition MT variant. I am just wondering that on one hand, Skoda wants to sell 3K upward Kushaq per month, on other hand, there are no cars, and then there is a wait for almost two months for 2022 cars to become available. So, are they not going to sell anything in Jan and Feb? Any idea, how does it play out? When do dealers start receiving cars of a new batch(i.e. new year)? Specifically, How much time Skoda takes in making the new batch available in the new year? Please share if you know. In the meantime, I have started to receive calls from the sales rep. Seems there is one car from Aug-2021 in their stockyard and they seem pressed to clear the old inventory. I am very skeptical about going ahead with the Aug-2021 batch and hence opting to ignore the year-end discount and rather wait for 2022 batch cars. Any thoughts.

Of course, the fact that they are not standing in the yard getting baked in the sun is reassuring. But display cars would get inspected and handled by shoppers.

2163, njaustin123 , 01:05 ,Newbie,"My first post in TeamBHP though have been around for more than 10 years now. Frist of all let me thank everyone for helping me in this decsion process The selection process I sold my 5 year old Ecosport (Diesel) in Sep 2021 as the company lease just got over by then. Was looking at an upgrade in the 15L price range. Options considered: XUV 700 - I was one of the first 25k people who booked it in the first hour of booking. I dont really need that big a car, but the launch pricing made me greedy for it, but finally estimated Delivery date in Jul 2022 drove me away from it. Creta/Seltos - Somehow I am not a big fan of the Koreans. I know they offer the best VFM and feature set, but still... Taigun - For my budget, I have to go for the 1.0 TSI here. Initially I was worried whether this will be an underpowered car. But on taking a test drive it felt better than Creta's 1.5 NA in both dynamics and power. The Kushaq Twist !! So I made my mind for Taigun and was waiting for the delivery of the Highline variant. But there was something I felt missing in Taigun - the looks. Both Kushaq/Taigun are little bit smaller than Creta/Seltos in all dimensions. But both Koreans have a good road presence. After making my mind for Taigun, I started observing Taiguns and Kushaqs on the road. Most of the time Taigun felt more car-ish than an SUV. Mainly the front looks, which makes it look like a bigger Polo. The backside too though youthful with full LED strip, didn't appeal me much (Sorry all current and future owners of Taigun, no offense meant - just my taste). But with the exact same dimensions and most parts shared, Kushaq looked bigger and more masculine - mainly with the typical Skoda grill. It looks like a smaller Karoq or so. Back side also is more classy than Taigun. Though not as butchy as the Koreans, Kushaq seemed good to me. And while I was undergoing this great confusion between Taigun and Kushaq, Skoda dealer (EVM Kochi) came up with an irresistible offer for me - a discount of 50K+15K (Corporate) plus some discounts on Insurance. So I went through a heated up set of discussions with my family, called up my friends - some who are skoda owners and others who are auto experts. Finally made the decision to go for Kushaq and an Ambition MT 1.0 was available in Carbon Steel immediately. My Quick Review So after the usual wait time for registration and some painting/dechroming/coating work, I got delivery of the Kushaq last Friday. On the next day made a weekend trip to Kanthalloor. My current review is fully based on that. ODO is at 400 KM after the trip. Coming from Ecosport I was kind of spoilt with its dynamics and ride quality. Luckily Kushaq feels like a worthy upgrade with similar qualities and in terms of comfort and rolling a much better car. It really feels very stable and rooted to the road. Things like braking and cornering are really good too. I am also happy with the features that I get as part of Ambition trim. The nice display and audio, ambient light, projector HL etc. I even liked the MID with the way it displays gear status and recommendations on gear up/down, song details, call details etc. The two spoke steering simply feels superb. Wireless Android auto worked fine too. Small Niggles: - Yes the ORVMs are small. it should have been longer or more square-ish. - AC Temp and Fan controls looks fancy with the touch controls. But practically not so great. You can't accurately control it without spending at least 10 secs of looking at it. So better off with one time temp setting and putting it on Auto rather than trying to adjust fan, air suction etc. on the go - Jio Dongle says provisioned, but shows error saying device not connected. Hence wasnt able to use the connectivity feature. Need to take it to Skoda once and probably needs a re-insertion of device Overall Very Happy!!! Need to try some more road trips to evaluate, but overall looks like a nice upgrade. Old Skoda owners might call it only 75% Skoda due to localization. But still better than many other cars in the price range, I would say, in terms of both build and ride quality. FE shows 12.3 after the Kanthalloor trip. 5.5 hours one side and half of it high range. Yet to check with full tank method. So expecting some 10-11 in city and 14-15 on highways which is pretty much OK. Overtaking in 3rd gear is fun. Accelerating more in 2nd and 3rd gear produces some good amount of sound thanks to 3 Cyl and no sealing of hood. But it is not disturbing and in fact a sporty vrooom sound.

I have test driven everything from Kiger , kicks, kushaq, taigun, Seltos (after rumours of upgraded suspension), creta, harrier, safari and innova. Simply put, after crossing the barrier of 20 lakhs there is no better car than the innova. The test drive innova had 45000 kms on it and felt like new. Whereas the safari although better in most aspects than innova had lot of small Niggles in the test drive car which had run only 7000kms. I always wanted to buy the creta before the Seltos and somehow the heart says it will turn out better in build than the Seltos. So my best three options are 1. Kushaq ambition at. 2. Creta SX o diesel at. 3. Innova GX AT 4. Wait for Kia carens. I am getting a good deal on the 2021 kushaq. But the test drive was not up to the mark with rattles in the cabin. Kushaq will be an outright purchase while all other s will be on loan so the difference of petrol vs diesel won’t matter with the interest on car loan. Need help here.

Current vague things happening with VAG group like feature removal - OVRM 3. Skoda after sales service post 4-5yrs. I have heard they are notoriously famous for that.

With the chip shortage and long waiting periods, this practice is becoming even more common than before - i.e. not having exclusive display / demo cars for showrooms rather circulating delivery cars for display every few weeks. I've seen the same practice being followed here in Pune at least at Skoda and Kia. They do not have 2022 stock yet, so they're keeping the last few of 2021 stock on display. You must look for scratches and swirl marks (especially on dark colors) before accepting such cars. However, I wouldn't call such cars ""abused"".

Since you did not specify your average monthly driving and since your usage is 90% in the city, I assume that it should not be more than 1000-1200kms per month including your twice a year outstation trips. So given your requirements, hands down it is Creta petrol. If your monthly driving is more than 1300-1400 kms, it is Creta Diesel. Why Creta instead of Innova? 1. Well, it is true that Innova is the most reliable of your choices and ages well like nothing else. But Creta petrol/diesel is no less in terms of reliability. Creta, even if not better, ages equally well compared to Innova. 2. Again for your requirements, I don't see the need to go for a 7-8 seater unless I am missing something here. 3. Creta is more ""value for money"" than Innova for your requirements. Creta is loaded with all features to the brim. Innova scores poorly in the feature list. 4. Since you drive more in the city, the fuel cost will be heavy for Innova being the heavier car, bigger engine, and bigger car. 5. Of course, the initial investment is at least 20% higher for Innova compared to Creta which again doesn't make sense for your requirement. There is nothing against Innova as such. It's just that it is not the right fit for you. Regarding Kushaq, it is still in its beta phase only. It is again not a true german. Rapid, Polo, Vento are better Skoda's/VW's than Kushaq & Taigun. And of course, I am not convinced about the recent feature deletions for a 20L car. And Hyundai/Kia is always more reliable than a Skoda/VW. Regarding Carens, it depends on your timeline. Again, there will be initial niggles as always in all the new launches.

I was almost on the verge of booking the 2021 sports diesel manual but couple of things changed which I will detail later down in the post. Tata Harrier: I loved the looks of the Harrier. When I test drove the manual version my left knee kept hitting the console which wasnt an issue once they launched the automatic variant. Couple of things went against the Harrier. First the test drive vehicle had interior deteriorating and the engine sounded like a truck. The SA was like telling me, Sir new vehicle will not have such issues and are very quiet and I was like in my mind saying ""Dude, you just gave me a preview of what my car would sound like 5 years down the line"". I couldnt quite get why the sound was bad in the harrier but in the compass it was bliss. Thats when the SA who got the compass told me about the dampening used in the compass. Anyways wife didnt like the size, sound and almost everything about it. I knew it didnt stand a chance and moreover I think Tata's are focussed on improving the Safari and practically done nothing to the Harrier post 2020 which solved most of the niggle of the 2019 models but is still a half baked product. Seltos: I loved the looks and test drove both petrol and diesel automatics. I loved the diesel automatic and I was very sure this is the car for me till the crash ratings of 3 flushed all my dreams down the toilet. Creta: I never liked the looks of the Creta and very reluctantly I took the test drive. I quickly understood why its the segment leader. Once you get inside the Creta its heaven. The interiors, ride quality.. its like sitting on a Lazy Boy chair. Very upmarket and they have understood the Indian consumer so well giving the right mix of features. I was like hell with the look let me get a hassle free car with great service network. Went to book but got very lack lustre response from the dealer. It was like they werent interested as they had a good order backlog So here I was all confused which one to go for. the Jeep for its overall good looks, amazing driving dynamics, comfort with a very powerful engine but poor service network or the Creta which had decent value proposition, you get a top end variant which is a lack cheaper than the base variant of the compass with all the bells and whistles and creature comfort. Oh boy what a dilemma and I tell you I was at it since 1.5 years. Both of which I was almost ready to book but something or the other prevented me from going ahead. In the meantime I was also exploring the used car market with a budget of 15 lakhs. I soon realised in Bangalore there isnt much value you get with the used car as they are pricier. Let me give you a few examples.. there is 2020 compass but has clocked 40k on the odo.. that too in covid time with asking price of 17L or 2017 limited compass with asking price of 18L with 30k on the odo, a diesel Tucson 2018 automatic with 70k on the odo and asking price of 17L. I was like if I have to shell north of 15L as well as go for a new car as I keep my cars long and not too worried on the segment of the car. Anyways I didnt come across any good deals at the moment. All this while I never once looked at Skoda, VW due to the horror stories I read about on after sales services and high maintenance cost. Marutis didnt have anything new and was still on old tech with their engines and auto gearboxes. Honda had nothing great in the compact SUV space and Toyotas just had rebadged Marutis. In all this confusion and frustration I reached out to Vid6639 with my dilemma and he suggested why dont I wait for Kushaq and check it out. I was like ok lets see and then when it launched and couple of months later I saw lot of EPC issues and car stalling stories cropping up in social media. I just stayed away from Kushaq. In the meantime in Nov 19 2021 we went to Hyderabad. This was the time when there was floods all over Andhra. The SX4 did quite well on the highway but in the city as we were negotiating the heavy traffic in Jubliee Hills a painful fact hit me. I was getting old and my knee was not able to take the abuse it could take a few year back. With painful realization I realised I had to let go of the compass from my shortlist as auto was way out of my budget. That left the Creta. Once I came back I thought why not test drive the Kushaq The SKODA Kushaq Story I called up TAFE in HSR with half a heart of expecting a response. They picked up, took the details and said someone will call up. No one did and I was like yeah thats expected from Skoda. Right from the start I was very pessimistic and critical of Skoda and Kushaq. Third day I get a call and we quickly fix an appointment for test drive at my home. I was staying in the outskirts o bangalore and I thought he will refuse like the Creta and Seltos sales rep. To my surprise he said he will come. I told him I wanted to test drive 1.0L auto. Once he arrived wife and I took it out for test drive with SA in back seat. I actually had no intention of buying SKODA and in my skepticism I told him I wanted to try this on bad road. Just the other day it had rained with lot of slush and broken roads where I stay. I had read about certain costing like no insulation under bonet and no underbody protection and I was like why would they do that. I read somewhere that the under body insulation was not provided as turbo petrols run hot and this would hamper heat dissipation. I am not sure whether this theory is correct. I frankly didnt have much expectation on the 1,0L engine. I was like what will this puny engine deliver. Its sure to be underpowered. Anyways as soon I started the engine I could hear the rumble of the 3 cylinder motor. After about 40 secs it dropped to about 750 rpm and pleasant hmm...We took the turn outside the layout toward the bad road. I warned the SA that this is the road I plan to take, are you sure and he was like no problem sir. Take it wherever you like. I took down the path expecting the car to bottom out, slide and infact even stall or get stuck. To my astonishment nothing of that happened. Its just sailed through. After that I took it to the highway. As I floored it I was thrown back on my seat. The only other car which gave that feel was the diesel compass. I was like blown away by what this engine was capable of. By the end of the test drive I was super impressed on the Kushaq Buying Decision I realized the top variant of Kushaq was expensive for the features it offered. The 1.5L being an imported engine and DSG which has a history of failure kept me away from even considering that as an option. I realized that the ambition 1.0L torque converter was the most VFM variant not only in SKoda line up but across the competition. Creta SX petrol or diesel auto was hitting 20L OTR in Bangalore. The other thing lingering around was on service and support. I was like let me derisk by taking a 1.0L which is 98% localized and the reliable torque converter which has worked well in most of the cars in Indian condition. To add to it there was an offer of 4 yrs maintenance package priced at 26k for 16k and 5th and 6th extended warranty which I dont think any other manufacturer is offering. So if I put all these together Kushaq became an option too hard to resist Buying Experience: Once I was clear on which model it was a huge relief knowing that my 2 yrs of dilemma was finally going to end. Some pics from the PDI. I was able to check everything from the T-BHP checklist except drive the car I got my vehicle within a week on 3 Dec 2021. The only modification I did was change the seats to Napa leather or Art leather as I like my interiors to be bright. Delivery experience was smooth and very good. The amount of followups I got from SKODA from the showroom and SKODA itself was truly amazing. I felt they are doing quite a lot to change their past image. It was also quite amazing to see their brand director Zac Hollis be so active on social media addressing issues and taking feedback and then implementing it. The SA was very helpful making the overall experience pleasant. I opted for the mini kit which came with all the liquids, freshner, mats and sun blinds in the rear and cushions. Ownership Experience I started doing small distances here and there but somewhere in the back of my mind I always had the doubt how will it do on highways and long distance. The same month my friend from Hyderabad visited us and we hatched a plan to do the 5 pancha bhuta temples. Bangalore--> Kalahasthi (Air) temple --> Kanchipuram (Earth) --> Thiruvanamalai (Fire) temple --> Chidambaram (Space) temple --> Trichy (Water) Temple. After that go to Palani --> Coimbatore and then back to Bangalore. We covered 2000 kms in 10 days. Observations - No issues whatsoever. No EPC, no stalling on the road nothing. I thought with a mix of normal fuel and speed I would have issues but didnt have any problems. As a precaution I used to fill petrol once it dropped between and half and quarter. -When you start the engine you will hear and feel the vibrations and the engine rpm is around 1.5k. I now wait 40 secs till the rpm comes down to 750 before I move the car. By then the vibrations come down and is silent. - It was fun to ride with fuel efficiency hovering around 17-18kmpl. In City its around 11-13 kmpl. - The headlights has wide spread of white light. It was truly amazing driving at night - I didnt know that features like cornering fog lamps. auto ORVMs and ambient lighting was part of this mid spec variant. - It was surprise to us that on bad roads we could feel the bumps inside the cabin. That was something my wife has been complaining. On enquiry I learnt that Skoda vehicle suspensions are on the firmer side. I still have to figure out whether a change in tyres or lowering the tyre pressure would make the ride better. Currently the tyre pressure is 33 PSI as mentioned in the spec - Horn is mild and meek. Sounds pleasant but people hardly move or give way. - Reverse Camera is of poor qualtiy. Manageable - Tyres are from Goodyear with 16'' rim size and the spare wheel is of 15''. One thing unusual is you need a calliper which they provide to remove the plastic nut caps before you can unscrew the bolts of the wheel. - Automatic and Turbo's are new to me and I am still trying to figure out the best way to drive them. Spirited driving drops the FE to single digits as mentioned in the TBHP reviews -- This car's creep function is aggressive. I would say it lurches ahead instead of creep. Its good in bumper to bumper traffic but gets a bit annoying when you are trying to park in tight spots - This engine is eager to go unlike the creta and the seltos. - For rear drum brakes the braking is quite good. I thought since it didnt have disc brakes at the back braking would be poor like my SX4 but I was pleasantly surprised. - Loved the black cladding and fog lamp placement. That way room for damage is minimum. - Steering can be adjusted both for height and reach. - I noticed that once you activate cruise control and you press the increase key the car at times will surge ahead non linearly. It caught me off guard the first time around. Now I have got used to it. - The A/C initially I thought was weak. But I realized that if I set it 2 degrees lower than what I need I get the desired effect. For e.g. If I need temp to be 21 degrees.. I will set it to 19. I know its weird but that's how its working for me. - When driving on highway you get a single beep after 80km and then regular beeps after 120kms. The seat belt warning is there for both driver and passenger and the beep changes frequency as the duration get longer. This wasnt there in my earlier car. Thanks to this feature my wife now is forced to put the seat belt. - Extremely stable at high speeds and overtaking is not an issue. For a turbo automatic they have masked the turbo lag quite well. I still have to get a first hand view of the service experience. Didnt land up with any issues that would warrant a visit to the service center. As advised in t-bhp reviews I did take the maintenance and extended warranty package. I also love the fact that it has a 15k service interval unlike the Harrier which is 7.5k.

Except for the driving dynamics, this car has been a real pain in the arse starting day 1 of my purchase. The ASS has been a horror story(I'll be doing a writeup in a separate thread) and getting issues fixed has been really tiring and time consuming. It has come to a point where I am questioning my purchase decision of VW cars. I used to have door squeak/rattling sounds from day1 and that was fixed 2.5 months later by changing the door beading (after keeping it in service center for 2days and numerous calls to the SC). And now there seems to be a crazy rattle on the left side of the dashboard on slightly rough roads as well. Skoda SC has not been able to diagnose the issue for the dashboard rattle at all. Any of you owners here have faced this dashboard rattle before? If so, what was done to rectify it ?", 24th January 2022,skoda-kushaq,Mangalore,15,39,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Negative

The wait time on the Creta was also a bummer. Congratulation on your new car. I gave up on it due to lack of dealer interest and the wait time. I got my seat covers from Fitwell. Its listed in tbhp directory (https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/banga...bangalore.html (FitWell Seat Covers - HSR Layout, Bangalore)) It is fitted on top of the existing seat covers. They did have to remove the seats to put it. I dont think its a slip on because then they wouldnt be able to give you that factory finish. I was very clear on keeping the existing covers and putting on top of that. I had done the same for my SX4 which I think I had done it back then with G-Sport. Since Fitwell was nearer and the reviews were good and he had done a couple of Kushaq's I chose him . I think I must have paid around 11-12k. They gave me 2 pillows free. Fit and finish was very good. Gave it in the afternoon and fitted by 6pm the same day.

Following are the observations from an existing Skoda Rapid DSG owner with 47k kms on the odo- Likes:Build quality is good, door thud is comparable to Rapid, maybe 90% of it Exterior fit and finish is good, even panel gaps Paint quality is good, looks lovely in carbon steel shade Rear seat space and under-thigh support makes up for a nice place to be in Ergonomics falls in place very well and for an existing vag owner it's easy to get comfortable in the first few seconds 1.0 tsi is seriously an impressive engine, pull on offer is much better than those 1.5 NA engines NVH from 1.0 tsi is well controlled Brakes are better than Seltos despite being Disc-drum setup and also better than my Rapid Ride quality is comfortable For a tall crossover, the dynamics are commendable and turn-in is quite sharp. Body roll is very well controlled Practical cabin and can be a good highway cruiser Achilles heel of Rapid is addressed- Headlights Dislikes:Doesn't feels like a significant upgrade from Rapid Road noise is on the higher side when compared to Rapid, I could hear the road surface a lot more than the Rapid or maybe it is the Michelin effects as the TD vehicle wore Goodyear (Suspension was silent though) Plastic quality could have been better, atleast for top of the line 20L variant Headliner reminded me of my Maruti days, Rapid in comparison has much better headliner Infotainment is much more advance than the 340G plus but the screen is reflective type, Rapid has a matt dark screen Interior scheme could have been better, feels too dull (Slavia's interior scheme should trickle down to Kushaq too) I missed physical buttons for AC, why does everything has to go the touch way in modern cars? Again, it was a wonderful experience here at Skoda Raipur, sales manager Mr Praveen is really a nice chap and it's always interesting discussing cars with him, he owns Rapid too.

While the rest of the PDI went off fine, had a couple of concerns. 1. The general fit and the quality of plastic is an unfortunate result of the 95% localisation, we all know. But the consistency in the fit is very unlike Skoda/VAG. Here's what I found in one of the door beading. It closes well, the thud etc. but looks hideous, especially when zoomed in. They have said they will fix the alignment, which should be possible, i suppose. 2. While doing the engine bay inspection, found these stains. Because i zoomed in, it may look like rust but it isn't. When i felt it, felt like grease or a lubricant residue that had almost dried up. Maybe it stands out because it's a white car. But is this normal? They said it isn't leakage and could be cleaned. I would greatly appreciate some thoughts/advice on this as i need to confirm the booking today itself. With not enough 2021 stock available, the dealer is also pressing for a Yes or a No. I like the vehicle overall, is a December model and but for these 2 points, works for me.

And even that car had the same rattling noise, but it was a bit less noisy than mine. They also mentioned that since it's a plastic trim, we can't avoid noises completely. But when I mentioned that even my swift has a plastic dashboard and it doesn't squeak even a bit, they said they are okay with replacing the dashboard cover entirely after taking approvals from the skoda technical team, however they also mentioned since it's a plastic component, disassembling and assembling manually would ruin the factory fit and finishing, will expand the joints/locks and it may cause more squeaking noise than before. So they suggested that I use it for a few more days and asked me to come back in case the rattling increases. So I decided to give it some more time, till Skoda actually receive more complaints on this issue and come up with an actual solution.

Change of aspect ratio from 55 to 60 is a huge change in your case bacause the width has also increased from 205mm to 215mm. Please note that the aspect ratio number is used to multiply the width, to arrive at height (of side wall) of tyre. Overall radius increases accordingly.

Also any premium detailer that offers brands like CarPro Cquartz, Gyeon etc will not charge 25K for ceramic. Probably more than 35-40K. Ceramic has limited protection to swirls and chemicals. It provides good gloss and water beading. If you are parked outside it is the harshest condition. Ceramic will provide protection for a few months at max.

One may choose to get it done on the front/rear bumpers (if one so desires) - it will surely help to prevent scratches. If you approach it with economics behind it, then comments in post are out of context. Couple of days back i was at detailing studio and a Tata harrier pulled in. Front bumper has grazed against a wall. Car had Garware PPF. On closer inspection paint has peeled off and just replacement of PPF wouldn't suffice. Considering this owner was advised to get bumper repainted and then PPF could be reapplied. Consider the cost involved here. Initial upfront cost of PPF + Repaint cost + cost of reapplying PPF. Even with insurance claim owner is spending way more than just repaint cost. Is it any wise investment here? Similarly few high end cars which have ceramic coating regularly visit this detailing studio. Most of these needed heavy correction & in 2 years and they don't look as shiny or sometimes even worse than car of the same age with out ceramic. If the vehicle is exposed to harsh weather conditions on day to day basis then water beading also will not last more than avg 6-8 months. Initial coating looks super good & wait for couple of years then return with the long term feedback. If vehicle is washed by your watchman or driver then one will notice faster degradation. There is a very limited protection against swirls as its a very light coating (microns). Unless you are regularly maintaining for next 5 years it won't last. With the warranty there are rider conditions. Graphene is again a different story few reputed folks in the industry call it a marketing gimmick with out much added value. Story is similar with PPF. With the upfront cost of investment on PPF you probably can get through with less than 50% of cost for any repaints on minor issues during the life of vehicle. It's individual choice if you want to splurge, but if you purely look from upfront investment cost vs periodic investment vs repair cost you will know what works best for your pocket and returns you best bang for your investment. It's usually head vs heart story My previous vehicle was in top shape until the day had to part away with it. I was doing regular maintenance personally and once in a year visit to detailer for any swirl marks removal. Front bumper needed to be painted once and the back bumper had to be replaced. Now even these 2 repairs i didn't spend more than 20k during 4.5 yr period. No insurance was claimed. Once in a year detailer place was 3.5-4k. On average over 4 years it works out 36k . If I would invested in ceramic, it would have costed good 30-40k depending on the quality of products used. Over 4.5 years I would have spent Initial ceramic coating cost + repair cost + cost of recoating ceramic to the affected panels. i.e 30K (ceramic coating) + 20K (repair cost) + 8K ( re apply to ceramic, rough estimate) = 58k. 36k VS 58K math is simple.

It's a very sound & rationale advice. Now a days lot of detailers are giving 5 year warranty on ceramic and some of them heavily use local brands or mark up products as their own brands. Reputed dealer who is using well established product will charge more premium to keep profit margins intact. Neither every detailer tells you the entire story and the term & conditions attached with it. It's like a fine print we tend to oversee. In some ways you are locked with them for regular wash, wax & top coating. This is crucial to extend any life on the ceramic coating.

Unless one has a OCD of keeping their vehicle in very good condition over a long period and ready to invest some time effort then best is to skip ceramic & invest the same money in PPF for high impact areas. With a good quality PPF it would protect against minor impacts. Recent experience was driving in a bumper to bumper traffic and maintaining sufficient distance at the front. Suddenly a thud from behind & heat skips a beat, knew 2 wheeler has touched the bumper. Got down right at the spot to asses & PPF saved it from scratches and paint etching if any. Harder impact would have definitely cause more damage both to PPF & bumper. Worth noting was reaction of the 2 wheeler ""Traffic mein aisa hota rehta hein ignore karo"". Not to belittle in any respect but if there was a major impact the cost of repair would have been half the entire value of scooter. We can't always avoid such incidents as we consciously lack discipline by virtue. Prevention is always better than cure, hence if budget permits then recommend PPF on high impact areas only else just keep the same money aside keep earning interest & utilize for any repairs or upgrades in future.", 1st February 2022,skoda-kushaq,Hyd,340,682,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

2257, sid2017 , 23:04 ,Newbie,"Finally, my Tornado Red 1.5 DSG Style 6 AirBags was delivered on last Thursday. Why Red ? My three and half year old son said he will only sit in Red Car. Now that the color was decided , our search for new car started March 2021. Why Automatic? I have had a 8 Year old Blue Volkswagen polo(1.2L Diesel). As much as I loved that car, the engine did have a lot of turbo lag and I had to perform lot of gear changes in order to keep it in power band. This used to get very tiring in traffic and I thought now is the good time to move to automatics. Background: I had given my hopes for buying a new car since we wanted to buy a new home. We started looking for home in our budget in March 2021 thinking that homes might have become cheaper in pandemic , but we quickly realized that house prices has increased very sharply and inflation had been very high. Inflation in car prices has been nothing compared to house prices. We dropped the plan of buying house for 2-3 years to let that high inflation average out. My wife gave me go ahead for purchasing a new car. Research Process Kia Seltos: The no brainier actually. Red Seltos 1.4 DCT was supposed to be booked in March 2021 and get delivered in around May 2021. Test drive was great, SA was helpful, Chinchawad Kia dealership experience was professional(Baner kia dealership experience was bad). Engine was peppy,gearbox was smooth, ride was stiff but looks covered for it. All in all a great car to upgrade. Wife loved it. All good, what could go wrong ? Before booking the car, searched for issues on Team-BHP.I was not aware of GNCAP barely 3-star worthiness of Seltos since I had not been following car news when GNCAP ratings for Kia Seltos were disclosed. Explained to wife the reason to drop the Kia Seltos. It is really sad because Kia Seltos is such a nice vehicle to miss out. Hyundai Creta: I never liked the looks of new Creta although my wife was absolutely fine with it. Interiors are nice, but the central panel somehow does give you a feeling of being loose.The dashboard seems to be too plain and boring. The wow factor aka ""panoramic sunroof"" is there and gives airy feeling inside the cabin. I test drove 1.4L DCT, Test drive was good, ride quality in city is excellent. But the Creta has become too common now , the waiting period is insane. I had safety concerns also with Creta(sharing the platform with Seltos), so dropped the Creta from list. The worst dealership experience I had in my year long search has been with Hyundai dealers. Even if other dealers/manufacturers are selling fewer vehicles, they do have or will arrange the variant of your choice for test drive. But not with Hyundai dealerships. They are not even interested in selling you a Creta. I asked one of the salesperson for a test drive of any variant, he said why do you need test drive sir , just book the Creta, everybody does the same. I visited 3 showrooms , none of them had it for display forget about test drives. Finally, Kundan motors were able to arrange a test drive after long persistence since I did not want to reject a car without test drive. Jeep Compass: Jeep dealership experience had been absolutely best. I have test driven petrol automatic 3 times, diesel manual and automatic each once. Interiors are fantastic, quality overall is great. The manual diesel is absolutely hoot to drive. If buying manual would have been an option, I guess this is the easiest choice to make. Diesel automatic was also good but out of budget. I did not like the Petrol Automatic. It is little slow to react to pedal input and it almost felt like gearbox was confused lot of times on varied speeds.If driven in relaxed manner with gentle pedal push, the petrol automatic behaves as per expectation. Fuel efficiency with my kind of driving was around 9-10 KMPL in city which is good enough for vehicle of this size. Jeep should have provided at-least sports mode to make this one more enjoyable as rest of the car is wonderful. VW Taigun/ Skoda Kushaq: Both the dealership experiences were great with respect to test drives. I test drive 1.5 DSG Taigun/Kushaq. Both were almost similar to drive and liked them both. I booked Red Taigun on 24-Oct-2021 as I had familiar experience with the dealership. As days went by , I started seeing Red Kushaq and Red Taigun on road. I started liking Red Kushaq more and more. I cancelled Taigun booking and booked the Red Kushaq. Buying Process Booked the Kushaq at Akoya Motors, Baner, Pune and the experience with them has been very good. Got a discount at Insurance by sharing quotes from other vendors like HDFC Ergo. Took the 4 year service plan at 15,999 as well as opted for extended warranty. The car does not have electrically foldable ORVM. My car was delivered on 27-Jan-2022 and the circular from Skoda about Rs 15000 discount came on 28-Jan-2022. I sent email to Zac which was forwarded to Skoda customer care. They did not give me any cashback but gave in writing that Auto ORVM will be installed free of cost by year end. Other than that , the overall experience with Akoya Motors has been pleasant. Now a days, there is certain pleasantness in buying a car which is not much in demand(but you love the car), you are treated well and you get the car in reasonable time-frame. This is so unlike what you experience in Hyundai dealership(if you are buying Creta, with other cars especially Alcazar the experience has been good). Changed the tyres from MRF Wanderer 205/55/R17 to Continental UC6 215/55/R17 in the same evening. Drive Experience Already have driven 200km. Some observations: Thunderstorm rattling on first day evening from left door which just vanished with good night sleep. No rattling since then. Ride quality is very good but you do feel large/sharp potholes. 1.5DSG is super fun to drive and seems efficient too with its ACT technology. It gets activated a lot in city driving also and is seamless. The cabin is spacious for four people. The middle seat is only for small kid. Interior quality is almost as good as what competition offers(Except MG Astor). Audio quality is very good. Its compact size with clever packaging inside and great engine/gearbox makes it very practical car for a small urban family.

The un-damped vibrations of the road weakens the poorly screwed together assemblies and that IMO, is the root cause. Yes, the suspension set up is on the stiffer side as noted by many owners and let's attribute a good amount of the vibrations transmitted to the interior elements to this particular aspect. Which then points to the question: why mix stiff suspension with flimsy interior panels? That's like a recipe for iffy outcomes. For the record, I'm running with tyre pressures that are the minimum prescribed by Skoda for the Kushaq (33psi, all four tyres). I'm tempted to lower the psi by another 3 points or so, but with the kind of rough, pot hole filled roads I travel quite frequently for work reasons - I'm not too keen on taking a chance with the tyres and alloys taking unexpected strain/beatings. Getting the dampers & their rebound rate checked as you've mentioned is worth a try. It's going to be an uphill task to know if the SVC will actually do a check of these components. That being said, take a look at the part in the video where mild pressing/twists by my hand are enough to cause very loud creaking from the centre parts of the dash board.

Likes 1. Looks beautiful in exterior all around and all doors and bonnet is heavy. 2. Good gear ratio in Manual useful for City rides. You can easily run around in 5th gear at 40 Km/h speed. 3. Excellent visibility in the night due to good headlight throw 4. Good ride comfort in the short highway run I did. 5. Nice steering to hold and use. 6. Infotainment system is crisp and My Skoda connect App is useful. 7. Storage space is well designed both inside cabin and boot which makes it fully useful. Dislikes 1. Noisy. Everything is noisy. 3 pot engine noise is significant during start up. It starts up at 1200 rpm with high noise (sometimes with vibration too in early morning starts) and takes 10 second to settle down at 1000 rpm which reduces the noise but does not eliminate. 2. Windows roll up and down is noise is higher. 3. AC gets little noisy in just third setting of blower but Auto AC setting masks it better. 4. Tyre noise takes over once you cross 80 Km/hr in the highways. Car came with Apollo Alnac 4G tyres and spare is Goodyear Assurance Triplemax 2. 5. Small size spare tyre which can be driven only for 50 Kms. It is not suitable for Indian highway conditions. Unknowns: 1. Safety rating 2. Long term reliability 3.

Tata has been working hard to catchup with other brands but it looks like things will be easier for them as brands like Skoda are going down to meet the likes of Tata and Maruti. It should have been the reverse, you keep pushing yourselves forwards and not regress. What a shame to see plastic quality and Quality control that is poorest in the segment and even worse than the brand we bash the most. If this is what Skoda calls 2.0 it's shameful to put a Skoda badge on the car. They should do like Nissan and put a cheaper brand badge on it like Datsun. This does not deserve to be sold as a Skoda. Ford has suffered the same fate after the old Figo and Ecosport, they thought they can cut down on plastics and sheet metal feel and sell more cars with Aspire and new Figo. Both cars never took off in sales vs the Ecosport and old Figo. The biggest reason was they were trying to make their cars like Maruti and not make them like what Ford stood for. When a person buys a Skoda or Ford they don't buy it for features, vfm or after sales. They buy it for what the brand stands for and the image the brand portrays. If you dilute your cars and they no longer represent what your ethos is, the person may as well buy any generic Hyundai, Kia brand. You suddenly lose the only set of buyers who were buying your cars as you no longer have any USP over the competitor. A ford stood for driving dynamics, great handling and steering feel and solid sturdy feel. You can't dilute the ethos and expect to suddenly appeal to mass market. Like many Ecosport owners, I was looking at Kushaq as an upgrade. The Koreans just never felt like something an Ecosport owner will buy and the Skoda had similar traits on paper. After driving the Kushaq seeing the complaints here, it is no longer on my radar as the Skoda no longer represents the same values as someone expects from it.", 4th February 2022,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore,"17,716","43,228",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

After a long time, I had liked a car and was about to book it but after hearing so many basic quality issues from the current owners, I'm putting my plan on hold. It is unacceptable and unheard-of quality standards (lack of it) that I don't find in my very old hatch also. It is very apparent that Skoda India has managed to fail miserably in living up to the expectation of Indian buyers with their Kushaq product. Unfortunate that they thought they could take Indian buyers for a ride in the name of their brand. I just wonder ain't all these complaints/issues circulating in media reaching Skoda management? Isn't certain Mr. Zac quite active on social media? Is it not possible for them to course-correct and save the day for their brand/product. Because if they don't, they may be next Ford (shutting down business in India). Anyways, they are in the range of 2K-3k per month. How long the company can survive with such numbers?

2281, rideon74 , 17:54 ,BHPian,"Thanks everyone for taking the time out to respond/share with helpful suggestions. I'm taking a diplomatic approach with SGA cars out here in Coimbatore. To be fair to any SVC chaps, the Kushaq is a new launch. I think it takes time for a service team to get familiar with manufacturing/other hiccups. I suppose being among the the early buyers does put people like me in a spot when things wrong with the purchased product. But eventually, it's going to be the dealer's call on how best to go forward. No owner will wait indefinitely for issues to be sorted out... Quote: Originally Posted by maverick_kushaq Should we all Kushaq owners who are facing dashboard noises, tweet/email about this to Zac and get the same attention that EPC and door rattling got? Talking to service centers clearly isn't helping anyone in getting this fixed. Honestly, that's what all owners who have such complaints must do. Stick together and take it up with Skoda. But I doubt if that's going to happen anytime soon. The major reason being many owners might not want to highlight any flaws in their new acquisition, especially on social media. It was the same scene when the EPC errors where being suffered by many owners. Only a handful took the matter into public domain via social media. There were others too but one found that they only came up as mentions by someone else in the comments section of posts related to the EPC errors. Today morning I spoke with the service manager at SGA cars, Coimbatore - a nice gentleman named Mr. Wilson - and he says that only myself and one other Kushaq owner have reported the dashboard rattle. I told him I'm not bothered about the numbers - let's just focus on this one Kushaq which is mine. But I know this for a fact: when Skoda or any car company hands over poorly built cars to the customers, there's only a limit to which the dealership can rectify things later. I mentioned this to the SVC manager as well and told him I'll give him the car for as many times as they'd like to try various solutions - but eventually it looks like only a replacement of the errant part will do the job.

Please get that done, if not done already. The dashboard creaking is too much, I have some slight plastic squeak/creaks but that's like may be 10% of what you are getting, and only on super bad roads, and definitely not on ramps. But it just may be that I've done only about 1700kms so far. Since when did the dashboard issue start cropping up in your ride? Hi. The dash-rattle started getting noticeable by around 1200km and I'd mentioned about it in my detailed ownership review thread back then itself. By now, I've covered 5700km in around 2.5 months of ownership and things had gotten pretty bad. All the hullabaloo from the dash happens only when driving over rough/patched/broken roads. As for the door beadings, the car will be going over to the SVC tomorrow. It's going to anti-friction tape from Skoda now, they said. Well, whatever works is fine - as long as one noise related issue is solved, it'll help to better zone in on the other one.

Owners facing this issue can check for the same as the SVC is clueless about this. Thanks for sharing that video. The owner being an engineer has a fair amount pragmatism when dealing with the niggles that the Kushaq is/was suffering. Anyways, back to the point - the same clip I think was an issue in mine as well but for my car it was from behind the infotainment system. This was attended to when my car took it's first visit to the SVC for these niggles. I never had any rattles from the side AC vents as the owner in the video mentions. The location of the rattles in my car is very easily identifiable and the SVC guys who had come home to inspect the vehicle the last time had noted the same.

Didn't mention poor after-sales as it has been a Skoda hallmark since they entered. I am not going to recommend the Kushaq to anyone since these issues already indicate that the car will age poorly and become a resale disaster Well, in my case SGA cars at Coimbatore have been very helpful till date. No complaints about that. But I agree with you: if any one were to ask if they should settle for the Kushaq - I really wouldn't know what to say except wait up longer for later batches or just get some other brand. I think the Taigun doesn't suffer inconsistencies this much.

These creaks and rattles weren't there when i took multiple TDs of the Kushaq and in fact, when I'd done a personal PDI before taking delivery, I'd actually pushed/poked around the dash and other areas to see if things were in order. Things were absolutely fine back then. So what I've come to realise is that things are giving away slowly. 5700km in around 2.5 months, as I'd mentioned earlier.

Sanjeev, disappointed to hear your melancholy, your voice does exude that. From what I can see and hear in your brilliant video, especially the part where you press on the plastic panels on the head unit, it seems the plastic clips that join these two different set of plastics can perhaps be one of the culprit. Reminds me of the ol' days riding a Pulsar 220 famous for these unbeknownst rattles and repeatedly changing the rubber bushes myself, but to no vain. Did try the double-sided tape method where the male and female clips slide to click, lo and behold they reduced the high speed rattles by 90% in some instances, at certain speeds by 100%. A jugaad that was worth it, and was extremely pleased till I eventually parted off with the motorcycle. Is this a feasible option in yours? Perhaps yes and perhaps no (no cos, primarily it can't be done that way) or perhaps there can be a way, if the folks at the SVC can try it for your satisfaction. The jury's out there. Why not try it and observe if it helps, if it helps, then it helps. The squeals and squeaks are definitely a mood killer and robs one off the pleasure of driving an otherwise capable motor. No amount of silicone spray will solve these rattles, at most they will lubricate for the time being, and once they eventually dry up, these sounds return with an even intense vigor, and that's definitely not a pleasant one, my personal experience.

IMHO many people can't even stand the sound of a bottle squeaking against the door pockets and end up lining the cubby holders with felt! Hats off to You sir who's managing with these squeaks on a daily basis. Kushaq and Taigun are the newer offerings from the VAG group in India and are special in their own way. I would openly like to condemn the people who claim that the Polo hasn't changed over the years. It did, and here's a list when I compared my decade old Polo TDi to a new TSi. Seat foam: Didn't subside in a 10 year old car but was literally forming a bum-pit in a 1 year old 4k driven demo car Steering Feedback: Steering Racks Made in Germany Vs Rane Madras. Believe it or not, it's different. Pathetic suspension: Gas filled Made in Germany Vs Oil filled Made by Gabriel in India Spongy braking: FS-III callipers Vs TVS Girling Spare parts quality standards: Factory-fitted Ate Make brake pads still have life left at 1.3 Lakh kilometres of hard braking in the hills Stories of Suspension bearings squeaking within months of purchase: Börsehung Germany to Local Suspension mountings Squeaks: Well put decade old interior Vs chu-chu on potholes Horror Stories of alloy wheel bends: Made in Spain 7 Spoke R15 Alloy Wheels Vs Made in India Portago R16 Alloy Wheels Prone to dents: The thickness of the sheet metal was reduced by VW. Yes! You read it right! They followed MSIL. Just go to the junkyard and compare a New Polo/Vento's Fender w/o indicator with the Fender having a hole for the indicator Features engulfed: Split rear seat in older versions Vs a bench seat in new one Hard plastics everywhere: At least the door armrests were covered in fabric. These guys managed to make it all plastic which is a pain to touch! Sticky switches: Everything in my 2011 Polo felt so reassuring after use. The stalks, power window switches, hazard light switch etc. Just to reiterate the difference, every switch/stalk feels to be sourced from aliexpress Prone to scratches: Not the paint quality but the PLASTIC LOGO! Any exterior chrome painted part like the lettering or the VW badge didn't fade or develop scratches even after rough use of 10 years but the test drive vehicle had every chrome part fading out ORVMS: Larger ORVMs with great visibility Vs the tiny ones which can be retracted with the switch. Come-on VW. I'm ready to fold the ORVMs with my hands to not compromise on blind spots if You feel that bigger mirrors were expensive Plastic Quality of bumpers: This is something which I came across while checking out a facelift kit at a VW service centre itself! The finishing of the bumpers in the older versions of Polo, their thickness and weight was much more when compared to the new bumpers. Underbody Protection: A full underbody protection Vs an engine guard available extra Foam Fillers: Hollow chassis casings in the older Polos like the fenders were completely filled with foam filler pieces as impact and road noise absorbers, however while observing a few newer Polos, they didn't have it. Kanjoosi for a piece of foam. Anti-theft monitoring system with a large cabin light: Even though the Polo didn't get it, the Vento did. The bump near the cabin light always felt to be a sore, but what's hard for a Vento owner? An amazing feature sacrificed to save costs VAG cars have surely stepped down from their quality standards and I can assure you on it. With my 10 year old Polo 1.2 TDi getting old, I did consider the 2021 Polo for an upgrade but all the above mentioned factors changed my mind. Same is the case with Taigun and Kushaq. VW and Skoda pulled up decent numbers for these CSUVs because of their ancestral reputation in the name of build quality, TBH. Just check out a VW T-Roc in flesh and you'll feel like home. A home to real quality. Hard plastics? Yes! Cheap plastics? No! If You wanna have your meal at a fine dining restaurant, any amounts of welcoming gestures, food decor and designs on plates or cuisine presentation won't satisfy you until the food tastes good.

A dry door rubber sound will be more like leather crackling than this rhythmic sound heard in your video. Not quite. Have repeatedly noted that whenever I give the car a wash at home, then wipe down the door beadings with moist cloth, let it dry & again wipe them down with a mild amount of dash polish - the creaking vanishes for a day or two (max.) After that, when the exterior heat dries up the polish applied, it's all back to square one. I'd also conferred with my earlier sales contact at VW (when I was considering the Taigun) if they received any customer feedback with the same issue. His reply was that yes, but very few. Initially, their course of action was to apply silicone lube to the beadings but now it's a full replacement from VW similar to what Skoda's doing as well. The 'rhythmic sound' I'd mentioned about in the video was from the dash rattling when driving over rough patches at just moderate speeds. A point of note here: in the part where I've recorded the dash rattles for the video, I was off for the business trip early next morning, so the car got a wash the previous evening, with a rub down of dash polish of the door rubbers. I was driving on an empty but bad stretch at around 5:00am when I decided to take the video of the vibrations from the dash. Maintained a decent speed over the rough patches & since there was no door beading noises acting up at that time, it helped to pick up the dash rattles alone. I've also noticed that if I press down on some of the center areas of the dash console when rattles act up (especially just below the centre AC vents), the noises are muffled to some extent. I suppose there is only a certain amount of the experience I actually go through that can be imparted through a video. My vehicle's been picked up today morning by the SVC (again), so I'm waiting to see how it goes this time. Thanks much for your inputs.

All the investment over 20 years to build a brand that stands for solidity, robustness, built-to-last could quickly get eroded in months. I think the VW group is clearly seeing this risk picture longer term and the startegy may be to sacrifice the Skoda brand on this count and retain VW brand as the one that stands for these qualities. I remember reading somewhere that the VW Virtus will be the last mass market car that VW will introduce on the MQB-A0-IN platform in India. As a group they need volumes and with two brands in India, and if one has to stand for premium, better-built, exclusive and pricier, then the other has to compromise somewhere to achieve better pricing and volumes. So far, the group has not been doing a good job of having two brands and two brand positions to play with. They are in many mays, wasting the differentiation factor, with the positioning of the two brands coming across as heavily overlapping and confusing. There is no differentiation in pricing, build quality, safety features, powertrains etc. between like-to-like models of VW and Skoda. I am not saying it is correct to dilute the build standards in the new Skodas, but something has to give somewhere if they have to take a volume positioning with the Skoda brand. They have simply chosen to save costs on interior materials rather than on exterior fit and finish, safety features or powertrains. Rather sad, as this is the part the average Indian consumer cares the most about. Also, it may very well be possible to get good ""perceived"" interior quality at the same target price point or lower, as cars such as XUV300 (with a solid and built-to-last, though not luxurious, feel) have shown. My expectation is that beyond the Virtus, VW will go back to building cars with global standards and quality of interiors and Skoda will continue to play the volume game, trying to put together a package that retains some basic existing DNA in terms of drivability and safety and playing with other levers available to make pricing acceptable enough to make decent volumes.", 6th February 2022,skoda-kushaq,Chennai,"2,220","9,796",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

It is impossible to achieve this if you follow the global VAG standards and engineering processes. Hence you: 1. Define India specific standards and 2.

You need less thicker hinges, the door check-straps can be made thinner, the latch assembly cheaper and so on and so forth. Have you noticed that many of the new models nowadays do not come with three stage door opening anymore? There are a few Indian engineering service providers working on new models at VW Group India and they say the focus on cost, nowadays, is ruthless. Almost akin to Tata Motors and Maruti. But as Vid correctly points out: these European car makers had started off selling their cars with the tag of ""peerless quality"". Hence, when the customer base finds them making obvious cost cutting overtures the ""perception"" change, for the worse, is considerable. For Tata and Maruti their base was very low, hence any incremental improvement in PQ(perceived quality) is appreciated by their target customer base.

I do agree some of the issues discussed here is an annoyance which are hard to ignore but not all. Very minor irritants might be best ignored, but a quick purview of the main issues reported by some Kushaq owners (including myself) till date are hardly trivial - these make the car a terrible experience to drive/own. While the suggestion is well intended and you did mention that you had tried much to rectify the errors in your car yourself, there is always a risk that many issues may not settle down after year. By then, the interest/pressure on a dealer/the parent company to sort out matters will have waned and that puts one at a disadvantage. Immediate feedback is effective especially when large numbers of buyers report serious concerns within the early periods of ownership - forcing the companies to to make amends fast or face bad publicity. Let's take the case of Kushaq specifically as a good example. Since the first deliveries in started (late July 2021): 1. By the mid of September, unless numerous owners hadn't kicked up a fuss on social media channels and bombarded Skoda India with mails on the EPC issue, the existing and future owners would have had to swallow the initial response by the company to 'only fill RON 95 fuel'. What were they thinking before issuing an impractical statement like that? Lord knows. But eventually the fuel pumps were recalled and matters are better now. 2. Then came the hue & cry about the door beadings by around early October or so. My video link posted earlier is just a few seconds of how bad things can get - bearing with such noise over days/months of usage is really like a test of patience. Anyways, Skoda dealers were initially instructed to try quick fixes like silicone lubing and thanks to the complaints by the owners, complete replacements of new versions of the door beadings are being done since mid-November. 3. Now it looks it's the turn of the rattles - dashboard centre/left side AC vents/left side door panel - all of which seem to be emanate from certain specific zones (as reported by various owners) and once again, the negative feedback flow has started. To highlight what I mean, here's a few screenshots from a thread from another public group that I had peeped into before taking stand on my dashboard rattle issue (I'm not a member of this or any such groups of Kushaq btw): - Mods: please remove if cross-references from this site are not permitted - If the voices continue to get louder, this newly known manufacturing defect will also be addressed by the company - eventually.", 7th February 2022,skoda-kushaq,CBE,213,"1,352",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

Horror Stories of alloy wheel bends: Made in Spain 7 Spoke R15 Alloy Wheels Vs Made in India Portago R16 Alloy Wheels So far the alloys have held up Prone to dents: The thickness of the sheet metal was reduced by VW. Yes! You read it right! They followed MSIL. Just go to the junkyard and compare a New Polo/Vento's Fender w/o indicator with the Fender having a hole for the indicator Haven't checked it. But i am sure there will be surprises. Features engulfed: Split rear seat in older versions Vs a bench seat in new one Nope no split seats in mine. In fact did not knew that it used to come with split seats. Hard plastics everywhere: At least the door armrests were covered in fabric. These guys managed to make it all plastic which is a pain to touch! Soft touch ...ha ha whats that ? Sticky switches: Everything in my 2011 Polo felt so reassuring after use. The stalks, power window switches, hazard light switch etc. Just to reiterate the difference, every switch/stalk feels to be sourced from aliexpress Flimsy is the word for the quality of switches. Prone to scratches: Not the paint quality but the PLASTIC LOGO! Any exterior chrome painted part like the lettering or the VW badge didn't fade or develop scratches even after rough use of 10 years but the test drive vehicle had every chrome part fading out The paint is also prone to scratches. This despite self washing the car with micro fibre and shampoo. ORVMS: Larger ORVMs with great visibility Vs the tiny ones which can be retracted with the switch. Come-on VW. I'm ready to fold the ORVMs with my hands to not compromise on blind spots if You feel that bigger mirrors were expensive The ORVMS compete with those in commuter bikes. You are always surprised by someone sneaking past. Plastic Quality of bumpers: This is something which I came across while checking out a facelift kit at a VW service centre itself! The finishing of the bumpers in the older versions of Polo, their thickness and weight was much more when compared to the new bumpers. Haven't checked but i am sure your observation will be correct. Underbody Protection: A full underbody protection Vs an engine guard available extra Will have to check this. Foam Fillers: Hollow chassis casings in the older Polos like the fenders were completely filled with foam filler pieces as impact and road noise absorbers, however while observing a few newer Polos, they didn't have it. Kanjoosi for a piece of foam. No Sir, no foam in my car. Again did not knew about this. The road noise does filter in a lot. VAG cars have surely stepped down from their quality standards and I can assure you on it. Yes Sir, I 100% agree with that.

Once i asked the SA, why your service and spare costs are much more than industry standard. The reply was : Sir, 5 star mein khane ke paise jyada hote hain. I said OK agreed, but if that 5 star serves me pathetic food then i see no reason to eat there and pay a hefty bill !! Hence, I believe, load as many bells and whistles You want, the product won't win the customer's heart until there is a proper quality management system involved to keep a check on the quality of raw materials. It's seriously a wastage of all the time invested in the research and development of these vehicles with on-spot driving dynamics if they aren't holding up good.

I even own a polo gt and have experience with VAG cars, I would say the quality is not such a big let down as some comments have really shown here. The drive, handling of Kushaq is no match with any other car in the segment. Overtime, these small niggles like door beading noise etc will get sorted out. If you like the car go ahead and book.

Thanks in advance. In my opinion, if you like VAG cars, then Skoda Kushaq is indeed a good choice for your preferences. The niggles and rattles are not dealbreakers. Generally, Skoda cars age very well on fit and finish components. But good to keep away from the DSG version if you plan to keep the car for more than 60k km or 3 years. 1.0 with Torque converter would be the safest version to go for if you need an automatic.", 8th February 2022,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore,122,247,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

I drive mostly in Chennai and occasionally we take a long a drive. Mostly the car is only for two of us. Welcome aboard, sir. As a Kushaq owner (Style variant, 1.0L MT) since Nov 2021, here's a few points on the Kushaq from my personal observations: 1. Excellent in drive feel, stability and onboard safety features across the variants on offer. I loved the way this car makes me want to drive it when I took a few test drives before the purchase and I still have the same feeling. 2. Since the car's usage would be predominantly within the city limits with an occasional long drive, mainly for yourself & the Mrs. - the 1.0L variants (manual or automatic) would more than suffice - both are great packages. 3. Two extra passengers in the rear seat and some luggage in the boot doesn't really weigh down on the 1.0L engine at all. Surprisingly. 4. 3 adults in the rear is possible but make sure the one in the middle is very, very skinny 5. Since you're based in Chennai, perhaps you have more than one dealer to choose between. If yes, do try to find out which dealer has a better track record with the after sales service. As you may well be aware, this is the only thing that will matter in the years to come. Had it not been for the good name that SGA cars, Coimbatore (the only dealer + SVC we have here) - I wouldn't have taken a chance with the Kushaq purchase while some of it's quality issues were still in the news. 6. The quality issues that I have brought up in my recent posts (door beadings + some rattling noises from around the dashboard areas) may/may not be prevail in the latest batches of the Kushaq. It's anyone guess. I'm sorry to say so but that is the truth of the matter. 7. The door beadings are not something one should worry about, since it's just a matter of getting a full replacement done and that's on offer by Skoda through all dealerships presently. Perhaps this may not even plague the new batches as Skoda has been very responsive to negative feedback from customers. Kudos to them for this approach. 8. What one should hope for is that the dashboard rattle does not crop up (which may be very minor as some owners have reported or quite bad, as felt in my case). Rectification of such type of niggles is always a hit or miss. I sincerely hope this has been sorted by Skoda in the recent batches. 9.There's no point in asking the sales chaps if such niggles have been eradicated - they'll only say 'Nothing to worry. All is well, sir...' - exactly what I was told in November. Take such gung-ho promises with a pinch of salt. As long as the SVC of the dealership is good, things can be sorted out in the unfortunate circumstance. 10. As another member had rightfully mentioned just recently, the niggles being reported these days are not deal breakers. The Kushaq is wonderful in it's design, stance and delivers great driving experience. Period. 11. Both the Taigun and the Kushaq are diet-milk like products from VAG. So any expectations from the days of yore is best forgotten. These two products are still very much cars that enthusiasts will enjoy driving - but from a new kind of VAG brand quality that we will have to get used to. 12. Coming from the Hyundai Asta, you may find the suspension set-up a little stiff. It's the way it is in both the Kushaq and the Taigun. So running across some unexpected pot hole may be felt as a louder thud than your Asta. The stiff suspension is a boon when going into wide bends on highways at higher speeds. 13. For Chennai summers, you may need set the AC temperature in the Kushaq a degree or two lower than your previous car. The Style variants come with ventilated seats - a great feature to have for hot & humid climatic conditions. 14. Consider opting for the full option Style variant in 1.0L or 1.5L if you're planning to own this car for more than 6-7 years. 15. Also consider investing in the 5th + 6th year extended warranty pakage if your ownership will cross 5 years. Skoda has a lot of parts that are made in India now, but it might be a saving grace later. Well, that's all I think of right now.

After 1.35L km of trouble free ownership in my 9 year old Vento Tdi, started looking for my next car. I considered Kushaq/Taigun in December 2021 and also test drove (1L AT). There were good offers too. The exterior is no doubt gorgeously done and the drive was super good. Among other things, the interior though didn't feel like an upgrade for the price you pay. As someone mentioned before, the door/dashboard squeaks are a concern, but probably will sort themselves out in the long run. Only time will tell how much compromise on materials has been done. For now, good interior quality seems to have moved upwards of 25L-30L segment. Not sure what they have done with Slavia, waiting for its unveil (how many unveils before they finally unveil it?).

Did you just perform a thumb press test on the new vs old car to check the sheet metal thickness? Or there was more?

Please don't mind asking the above questions. Hello sir! I read your thread the day it went live on the forum and it was literally a pain to see the condition of your car. However, I'm glad you got it back in perfect shape. As far as the sheet metal is concerned, the weight of the new Polo's fender is lesser than that of the old fender. I confirmed this from VW Chandigarh. The fenders of my car were having tons of small imperfections bothering me, all thanks to the 2 wheelers in Patiala. The guys at the service center clearly said that both the fenders were similar dimensionally but the weight of the new fender is lesser than that of the old fender. That is because of the change in quality over the years. The same was with the seats. The thigh support is highly compromised when comparing the old and new seats and so is the quality of foam. This can be confirmed from any upholstery guy who has worked both on the old and new polo. Also, the observations regarding the foam were that the quantity of foam/thermocol pieces have been decreased in the whole vehicle as the fenders and runner boards in newer Polos are no longer stuffed with these materials. Moreover, thinner sound deadening materials used.

My experiences in bold itallic to the points raised in this post. I would like to reiterate all my observations with respect to other vehicles on offer in the market. If Volkswagen was to score points out of 100 for safety and quality control a decade ago, it would have easily scored 90/100 or even more, when compared to other brands ruling out safety at that time and scoring around 50/100. However, if Volkswagen was to score points with its current offerings, it would score an 80/100, which is still better than other tin-can coffins out there which would still be scoring 60/100. I would like to narrate a small incident. I was cruising along the Chandigarh-Patiala Highway at around 50 kmph because of the fog and was rear-ended by an overspending Baleno at 90 kmph. Even though the relative speed of impact was 40 kmph, I was just shook inside the car and was wishing for the damage to be somewhat less. I was happy that the airbags didn't deploy though. I'm posting a picture just 2 days after the accident (Touchwood). Didn't click any pictures of the Baleno as the two guys were way too furious even when they were the ones overspeeding and drunk. The Baleno was just 7 months old, had its airbags deployed, a flat bumper, a high bump in the bonnet, green coolant all on the ground and the radiator grill into pieces. Unbelievably, my car was perfectly fine with just a few scratches on the bumper paint which are not even visible with the naked eye and a fallen off numberplate. I rubbed off the paint transfer using Meguiar's rubbing compound and polish that very evening. The Baleno took 3 weeks to hit the road as the impact was transferred to its steering column too, while I was off on a road trip to Kalpa just a day later after an alignment and balancing session. There have been many incidents like these where decently built VAG, Tata and Mahindra cars have won our hearts but there are just some bits and pieces which do hurt. VAG cars are still loved for their safety and quality which is good enough, but it used to be better back then. I mentioned my observations with respect to the brand's perspective towards cost cutting and nothing else. VWs are still safer and better engineered, and I don't think anyone would complain about it.

While the need is not immediate, my garage does require a car for city runs and occasional short outstation drives with our four-legged kid. Was passing by a Skoda showroom yesterday and on a whim, decided to check the Kushaq out. Had a good look at the Style variant on display and also got to test drive the Style 1.0 MT and AT. The engine was surprisingly peppy for its size, as long as kept above 2,000 rpm and had a nice, throaty hum when revved hard. The MT was super-fun to drive with short throws and light clutch. The AT was as good as a TC can get, working very well to mask the turbo lag on the tiny mill. Could not try the 1.5 lit engine, as the car was out to a customer site for TD. My test drive car had ~10,000 km on the odometer and was already showing signs of wear and tear.

Quite abused. No noises at all in new cars, all issues have been addressed"". Net-net, the car did not feel worth 20 big ones! The Ambition MT at 15.xx would be better VFM in my opinion.

I believe Indian car makers use a generous amount of anti-squeak grease, gels and sprays all over the car while it is built. I was surprised how much grease was applied to the seat sliding mechanism and door hinges of my Thar when I took delivery. Now, if even in the visible parts of the car they use so much of this material, imagine how much of these substances may have gone into the invisible interior dash parts that are prone to squeaking while the car is built at the factory! In the hot Indian summer weather, are these things going to emit ""not-so-healthy"" vapors that you may breathe over all the time you spend inside the car? I would not be surprised if this is not a big focus area of research for MoRT&H or the Indian car makers.

Such kind of responses may deter the minority of car owners (any brand, any make) that suffer from manufacturing issues to stay away from posting about their negative observations in discussion forums. We write/post about what we go through when in a dilemma and I doubt if being condescending/questioning their integrity would help anyone. Cars may have plastic components that creak if pushed hard - yes of course. Plastics in cars are never designed with the highest tensile rigidity. Fastenings would otherwise fail when the car's driven over various road conditions. But no part of car is ever designed with an allowance to squeak/rattle in the future when driven in real world conditions over time. I presume that I'm not wrong in saying so. If it has come across in my video that the dashboard rattles I experience are attributed to the very loud creaks I've shown while pushing them, then yes it is. Simply because, in my case, certain areas have become a little too pliant. Much more than it was earlier. This is again expected to a certain degree over usage periods but when it started leading to a build-up of constant rattling while driving over patched roads, things were not kosher any more. Not in just 2.5 months of ownership. PS. - That point about 'touching up' the audio to deliberately make the noises seem louder than they are - in a way, you're questioning my integrity there. Frankly, I don't get what purpose that would have served me since I wasn't expecting a wave of sympathy that would resolve the issues nor do I harbour aspirations of becoming a auto-vlogger. Well, everyone has a right to their own opinions.

Some of the posts are just getting ridiculous now What is getting ridiculous (and sad) in my opinion is how my detailed post with a video of my personal situation has brought forward various very negative posts about the Kushaq in general. It's like watching a thread implode. What it points to the fact is that the maturity of being being able to call a spade a spade is best kept aside. Yes, we do have the freedom to air our views on any thread in the forum, but don't we also need restraint when we can see that a thread is losing out on posts that actually help present and future owners to better understand their vehicle? Some of the recent posts are have been brilliant (the one by Vaibhav with the comparison of parts used by VAG over the past decade, for example). But most other have resorted to actual 'Skoda bashing'. But does this mean that those of us in the minority (with the minor/major issues) should stay silent to avoid being ridiculed as OCDs or have their genuine concerns get labeled as 'trivial'? Anyways, me speaking up to get heard by Skoda has borne good results. I waited for a week since I got my Kushaq back from the SVC after they'd rectified the niggles I'd reported on.

Currently we own a Nissan Sunny XL Diesel (2012). The car has served us really well with no complaints. It has run 78,000 Kms with no fuss. Since we stay in Ghaziabad (Delhi-NCR), we need to replace it soon since it completes 10 years in May'22 and becomes obsolete. We would have loved to hold on to our car for a couple of more years if not for the stupid NGT regulation Requirements & Constraints: We are looking for petrol MT car in the range of ~15 Lakhs on road (with hard cutoff of ~16 Lakhs). We are very sedate drivers and never cross speed limits. Even on highways, we generally drive at 90-100 KMPH only. We are open to considering all body shapes but Sunny's boot space has spoiled us, so hatchbacks have been ruled out. We generally keep our cars for 10+ years. Also, not ready to take the pre-owned route. Since we have been driving a sedan for 10 years, we have always been conscious about speed-breakers and big potholes. The car has scrapped underbelly occasionally but nothing major. Thus a higher GC will be most welcome. We began TDing the cars last weekend and below is the list of cars considered: Shortlist Honda City City has been our aspirational car from the word go. Even when we brought the Sunny in 2012, City was the top contender and lost out only because it didn't have a diesel mill. Coming back to the 5th gen City, we really loved its elegant design when it was launched last year. Visited the showroom this month to see the car in flesh for the first time. Really loved the car's exterior and interior. However, the headroom felt a little inadequate. Sunny offers much better headroom and City made us feel claustrophobic. Also, GC felt inadequate and thus we didn't even opt for a test drive. Maruti XL-6 First car we test drove in our search. The main intention was to see the comfort of captain seats since parents are growing old. The interiors felt rudimentary. The NVH levels also didn't seem par and overall it was a pretty poor experience. However, will take a pause to applaud Nexa dealership. The car was vacuum cleaned before the test drive and dealership was very professional and courteous. Kia Seltos (HTX 1.5L MT) Immediately after driving the XL-6, we entered into Kia showroom. Initially, it was ruled out due to questionable safety rating, however since the showroom was just next to Nexa, we went in. Again a very courteous staff and were offered a test drive straight away. We were very impressed by the interiors, airy feel of the cabin and NVH levels. HTX model was decided and we were almost convinced of booking the car. Tata Nexon Next day, we thought of exploring the Nexon since everyone talks so positively about the vehicle. Entered the showroom and it was a mela out there (Sunday). However, staff was courteous and TD was offered. We didn't like the car since the TD vehicle was poorly maintained. Door-pad had cracks and the text on the push button had faded off. Also, the car felt a segment lower when compared to Seltos, thus we decided the drop the car from the list. MG Astor Since we were in Patpargang, wherein we have all car showrooms within 500 mtrs, we decide to check out the Astor as well. Again very friendly staff. We liked the car with nice interiors and pano sunroof. However, post the TD, felt that the roof-lining is very thin and car (with pano suroof) will be a hot chamber in peak Delhi summers. Thus it was decided that only variant without sunroof will be considered. Only concerns seem to be MG being a new and relatively unknown brand. Skoda Kushaq (1L TSI MT) Skoda was ruled out due to horror stories on the forum and issues faced by Kushaq owner's when it was launched last year. Casually walked into the showroom with no intention of taking the test drive. After taking a look at the car, the SA tricked us into taking a TD. We told him that we'll take TD only if he allows us to take it to the highway to check its performance. He promptly agreed and this was probably the mistake we made. We took it to the Hindon Elevated road - a more than 10 Kms access controlled road with sparse traffic. Even at higher speeds it was rock solid. We were might impressed. Only downer were the hard plastics, slightly smaller cabin and dark theme which makes it look even smaller. Just to be sure, we went back to Kia again and TDed Seltos on the same roads again at similar speeds and difference was clearly visible. We have been impressed with Kushaq and I request fellow members to guide if we should go-ahead with Kushaq or stick to the likes of Cretas and Seltos'. Our main concerns mentioned below: - Skoda ASS horror stories in terms of both cost and reliability. In our 3 decades of ownership, we have faced Nil breakdowns (we are not even sure how will we react if our car breaks down in middle of a trip ) - EPC issues, Rattles and other minor irritants being reported on the forum and fellow members complaining that the car is not of the usual Skoda quality (although we are moving from a Japanese brand and driving Skoda for the first time, thus have been pretty impressed) Pls also let us know if we have missed any car that we should be considering.

2381, rideon74 , 09:21 ,BHPian," Quote: Originally Posted by anto1212 TSI engine needs break in? Few people suggesting to keep RPM below 2000 for first 1500 km That's a good question there! It would be best if you'd refer to page 10 of the owner's manual and use that info balancing the road & traffic conditions you drive in. If you're in the mood for a bit of reading, here's some info I'd gathered from the net before my switch to TSi engines after many years of TDi and VTG mills: These days engines are mostly made by robots, which have a massively more precise output and are also infinitely more conforming. Everything is built to such fine tolerances that the engine is perfectly 'just so' right from the factory. Because of this, many brands these days don't have any special running in procedure. They just advise customers to drive like normal and forget about it, and that certainly doesn't seem to cause any real problems. But VAG (including Skoda) do still include running-in advice and as such it'd be prudent to follow it. Regardless of what the Internet says, the people who designed and built your engine are likely the ones who know how best to treat it. That said, the manuals are not exactly clear or detailed - especially when it comes to the topic of running-in. The guidelines are very general & open to interpretation. Generally speaking though, the manual's suggestion involves not exceeding 3/4 of the rev range for the first 1000km and then progressively increasing the revs (including, shortly, trips to the red line when warm). The manual also advises not using full throttle and as we know: do not labour the engine at too low revs. This makes sense, as the end result is a drive that allows the new engine to warm up, and then uses most of its rev range to help 'stretch in' the new engine and its many components. You're not just bedding in one thing, but rather thousands of complex moving components, all mated together 'just so'. Luckily, due to the aforementioned excellent manufacturing processes you won't find lots of swarf in your oil any more, and a running in oil change is no longer mandated. Your engine, regardless of how well built, is still a new beast however - and still requires some TLC. Some points of note: 1. Make sure the oil is up to operating temperature before you start increasing the revs past around 2,500rpm. 2. That said, once the car is warm don't be scared to use the engine. The worst thing you can do is 'baby' it and just drive it everywhere on the low end torque, never seeing over 2,000rpm. This will be almost guaranteed to cause you problems with seating the new piston rings and can cause issues with oil consumption in the future. 3. As per the manual, vary the revs. Your new engine will still be 'tight', and that is something you will physically feel as you start to explore the rev range over the weeks and even months after acquiring your new car. For example, there will be a slight resistance/hesitancy/flat spot in the power when you reach (for example) 3000 or 4000rpm. This is the engine resisting itself and a manifestation of the parts claiming their space and rubbing up against each other under high load for the first time(s). Gently push through it, but gradually. 4. Once you get past about 1000km you can consider the car mostly run-in according to the manual. At this stage, if you have managed to restrain yourself thus far (most of us can't!) you can start to push further up the rev range. Perhaps 5000rpm when accelerating, before dropping into a higher gear for cruising & then 5500rpm or 6000rpm the next time and so on. 5. Drive away soon after starting the engine & the initial warm up sounds subside - never leave it idling for more a minute or two (depending on how cold the weather is).

2391, thilipk , 12:43 ,Newbie,"My first post after been accepted to the Team-BHP community few weeks ago. Have been reading the reviews and comments in the forum for as long as I can remember. Recently purchased Kushaq Ambition 1.0AT (Jan 22 version) from SGA cars, Coimbatore. Sales experience was good, car was delivered within 2 weeks after being told that there was a 2 month waiting period. very cheap sales gimmick to push 2021 stock. Felt cheated when I had to pay full price for a car which was probably manufactured within days after 2021, when 2021 stocks where on 60k discounts, only because the carbon steel wasn't available. It was looks, comfort and safety that made me choose Kushaq. I personally have very low expectations on performance criteria, being a sedate driver who doesn't push RPMs or cross 90km speeds even on highways. The shortlist was between Kushaq and Harrier and finally the 7lac price difference between Kushaq 1.0AT and Harrier AT XZA (have my own reasons for comparing two different cars in 2 different segments) and slight body roll in Harrier made us choose Kushaq over Harrier. It was immediate and continuing regret due to issues found during delivery and soon after. Not that Harrier would have been niggle free, but the helpless feel after having waited 6-7 months, multiple TD's of almost every car in the 15-25lac price bracket, pay 17lac of your hard earned money and still ended up with a sub-par car is heart wrenching. 1. Came to know that the Auto folding ORVM is taken out from 2022 cars on the day of delivery. The sales guy till the date of my payment said that there is no intimation about taking this feature out from the 2022 cars. I have since followed up with Skoda customer service multiple times. Except for a call from local dealer that I can retrofit this after the semiconductor shortage is resolved but no confirmation whether this will be recall or do I have to pay for it. Skoda didn't reply to my multiple follow ups. I am not in any social media sites, so not sure if this was decided already 2. The volume mute button in steering wheel wasn't working from day 1. Took it back the next day for inspection and few days again after being told that replacement part have arrived, but after a day in workshop, they discovered that the wrong part was delivered and I had to come back again later. 10 days since and still waiting 3. The infamous door creaking noise, on both sides for me. What a frustration this is. A brand new car making horrible old car noises even on slight undulation. I had to put off my trips to show off my new car to the family. Can't imagine the feedback for a new car, when my own ten-year-old Hyundai i10 AT (70k) and my dad's 8 year old EcoSport (110k) are still like squeak free. SGA Service told me that the door beading was replaced when I took it for replacing the steering button, but noise came back within a day. Now waiting for a supposedly premium door beading and some tape that will arrest the noise. The tape thing sounded like some quick fix idea to mask a manufacturing defect. I can't imagine how a supposedly premium German car manufacturer can let a car come out of its factory with so many issues. Really pathetic. On top of this, I am continuously being harries for feedback through phone calls and emails. Honestly, if Skoda spends fraction of the money to hire QC's instead of hiring call center agents, they probably would need to ask for feedback at all.", 19th February 2022,skoda-kushaq,Coimbatore,4,33,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

Hopefully, Skoda already took stock of these issues and next generation will not have any of these niggles. Still makes us think, how come no such issues were reported in the Taigun thread. The final fit, finish and QC is somehow done differently for both products?

Sales experience was good, car was delivered within 2 weeks after being told that there was a 2 month waiting period. very cheap sales gimmick to push 2021 stock. Felt cheated when I had to pay full price for a car which was probably manufactured within days after 2021, when 2021 stocks where on 60k discounts, only because the carbon steel wasn't available. 1. Came to know that the Auto folding ORVM is taken out from 2022 cars on the day of delivery. The sales guy till the date of my payment said that there is no intimation about taking this feature out from the 2022 cars. I have since followed up with Skoda customer service multiple times. Except for a call from local dealer that I can retrofit this after the semiconductor shortage is resolved but no confirmation whether this will be recall or do I have to pay for it. Skoda didn't reply to my multiple follow ups. I am not in any social media sites, so not sure if this was decided already 2. The volume mute button in steering wheel wasn't working from day 1. Took it back the next day for inspection and few days again after being told that replacement part have arrived, but after a day in workshop, they discovered that the wrong part was delivered and I had to come back again later. 10 days since and still waiting 3. The infamous door creaking noise, on both sides for me. What a frustration this is. A brand new car making horrible old car noises even on slight undulation. I had to put off my trips to show off my new car to the family. Can't imagine the feedback for a new car, when my own ten-year-old Hyundai i10 AT (70k) and my dad's 8 year old EcoSport (110k) are still like squeak free. SGA Service told me that the door beading was replaced when I took it for replacing the steering button, but noise came back within a day. Now waiting for a supposedly premium door beading and some tape that will arrest the noise. The tape thing sounded like some quick fix idea to mask a manufacturing defect. Welcome and congratulations on your new car. I hope things will get sorted out soon so that you can enjoy the car. I guess in Coimbatore, you have a single dealer and hence these type of sales tactics. In Chennai, 2021 cars were available even at end of Jan but with limited colors and I was provided an option to choose 2021 with discounts or 2022 without discounts. Probably because here there are at least 2 dealers. I went to 2022 due to the color. I don't think Kushaq is setting the sales charts on fire and guess more discounts will be available soon. 1. For Ambition there is nothing for the ORVM feature delete. Only for Style variants, 15,000 INR is provided as discount and can be retrofitted when available. Overall, it is very poorly handled with all this discount for top variant only and retrofit later. A better way is to add a voucher usable against that as an accessory and tied to the VIN number in the digital records like My Skoda app and handle it during services. Except for Zac Hollis none of Skoda Social media handles will reply anything. 2. On the mute button, will you please post a picture of your steering wheel as I am not aware of dedicated mute button in steering wheel (Mine is MT)? It has only Voice control ON/OFF and Previous/Next selection buttons. Are you referring to the Voice control ON/OFF button when it is used with Android Auto/Apple Car play to search things in the connected phone. 3. I am surprised at this as the new door beading foam in the door is supposed to be fixed in Production models from 2022 onwards. So it seems only the older door beading foam is still being used in production line till the stock is exhausted and do the replacement at service center based on customer complaints.

I have never owned a car in the past, but have driven many. I absolutely used to hate the interiors of Skoda cars except Superb. It didn't matter how rugged the setup was, the looks were dull, boring and made me feel like why the hell I was even sitting there. That's the same with Honda, exception being the old Civic with that huge digital cockpit, used to drool over it.

Feels frustrating, because Skoda always seemed to market Slavia as more premium and thus more expensive than Kushaq, which is why I didn't go for it Well, common sense says that the C segment sedan has always been placed below the C segment compact SUV till date. Slavia is a better product only in the enthusiasts eyes and it doesnt hold a candle against a product like Seltos or Creta when it comes to the interiors, features on offer and brand value. Hence, when Kushaq itself is priced at par and slightly above Creta and Seltos for the 1.5 Variants, no one in their sane minds would price the Slavia higher than these products and expect a brand new product from a company like VW/Skoda to do justice to the investment costs. In fact, the Slavia being priced at a premium to the City itself is a little overconfident on Skodas part. But yes, compared to the City, there are a few differences, positive or negative. However, since this thread is on the Kushaq, I dont think Skoda trolled Kushaq customers by Slavia pricing. Rather, they trolled customers with Kushaq pricing itself. It is not equipped well enough for the pricing it is placed at. Things like the interiors, roof liner etc are from a segment below and customers would definitely notice it. The test drive car I got impressed me on the performance front, but the interiors were really not feeling good. Everything looked dull and poorly put up. The choice of greys are really not good.

It should have been the reverse, you keep pushing yourselves forwards and not regress. What a shame to see plastic quality and Quality control that is poorest in the segment and even worse than the brand we bash the most. If this is what Skoda calls 2.0 it's shameful to put a Skoda badge on the car. They should do like Nissan and put a cheaper brand badge on it like Datsun. This does not deserve to be sold as a Skoda. Ford has suffered the same fate after the old Figo and Ecosport, they thought they can cut down on plastics and sheet metal feel and sell more cars with Aspire and new Figo. Both cars never took off in sales vs the Ecosport and old Figo. The biggest reason was they were trying to make their cars like Maruti and not make them like what Ford stood for. When a person buys a Skoda or Ford they don't buy it for features, vfm or after sales. They buy it for what the brand stands for and the image the brand portrays. If you dilute your cars and they no longer represent what your ethos is, the person may as well buy any generic Hyundai, Kia brand. You suddenly lose the only set of buyers who were buying your cars as you no longer have any USP over the competitor. A ford stood for driving dynamics, great handling and steering feel and solid sturdy feel. You can't dilute the ethos and expect to suddenly appeal to mass market. Like many Ecosport owners, I was looking at Kushaq as an upgrade. The Koreans just never felt like something an Ecosport owner will buy and the Skoda had similar traits on paper. After driving the Kushaq seeing the complaints here, it is no longer on my radar as the Skoda no longer represents the same values as someone expects from it. Irrespective of the cheap plastic which most car manufacturers are using these days to save costs, I never had a high opinion of Skoda or VW in general owing to their problematic cars with critical components like engine and transmission failing prematurely. The German cars are supposed to be unreliable in long run but VW has taken it to an altogether different league with their planned obsolescence.

Its very difficult to keep the acceleration in check I did a road-trip of around 500kms as well and your post just reminded me to share the experience. I have Skoda Kushaq 1.5TSI with the (in-)famous DSG transmission and completed 1200kms till date. 1.5DSG is a hoot to drive and you just want to keep driving. It is effortless in the city and on the highways. DSG never gets confused whether you are on the biggest of inclines, you are trying to overtake or just want to drive sedately. Kushaq never feels unsettled at any legal speed and is joy to drive in the ghats. This car is really meant for long trips. It has been a very enjoyable initial ownership experience of Kushaq. So, how do I feel about my overall experience as first time Skoda customer till date? I was disappointed when Skoda Kushaq 1.5DSG was launched with only two airbags. I went for a test drive nevertheless and was mighty impressed with its performance. I told the SA that I really like the vehicle but I will only buy the six-airbags version and to contact me whenever Skoda launches the same. Meanwhile, I took test-drives of Seltos, Creta, T-Roc and Compass. I really liked T-Roc but rejected it because I was skeptical of part availability. Jeep Compass Petrol gearbox is very sluggish and did not suit my driving style. Seltos and Creta are good cars to drive but 3 stars safety rating went against them. So, I waited for Taigun, and booked one in Oct. In the same period, Skoda launched the six airbag version of Kushaq. The same SA called me and asked if I am still interested in Kushaq and would like to test drive. I said if you could bring it home for a test drive then why not. He bought the car home for a test drive and returned with booking amount . I had a budget of 27-28 lakhs but did not like any other car than Octavia which was little over than my budget. I thought let's buy Kushaq and keep the amount saved in a well-balanced portfolio named as DQ200 . The car was delivered on time, no bad experience as such to share; in fact all the good memories. Lately, there have been lot of bashing for Kushaq/Slavia for its cheap looking interiors, roof liners, rattling, EPC issues etc. EPC issue is a serious one and I think Skoda got the well-deserved stick for that. Let's see how good a job is done by service centre. I am still fine with the interiors and roof liner as I think those are comparable in the segment and only MG Astor has better interiors. There has been some rattling noise from doors, but it is ok, it happens. I just sent my car for replacing door-beading today and I will receive it tomorrow. I know it will get fixed and that 1-2 service centre visits a year may be required. But, I am not too cynical about it. The car drives exceptionally well and I keep finding reasons to drive it. I think Skoda has improved, is putting the efforts and I have decent experience with them. Skoda Kushaq Style variants are definitely overpriced by around 1.5 lakhs. But Ambition variant is priced well for what it offers. Let us not be too negative and appreciate each car for its strength. No car is perfect and nor is mine.

In other words, the angular displacement remains same, while the distance covered by the bob is different. There are a ton of factors which determine the body roll in a sedan, as well as an SUV. One of the major reasons is the height of the shock tower w.r.t. the seating position and the roof height. Therefore, weight distribution plays a vital role in designing a vehicle.

Please let me know whether this makes sense. Attachment 2280530 I have an engineering degree in this sector, so let me explain it as simply as possible: People always tend to confuse between body roll and handling. The 2 are different, although it's very easy to confuse them. Handling is primarily how the car sticks (weight on the inside wheel) when going into corners at high speed, dependent on 3 factors: 1. Center of gravity 2. Width of the car 3. Suspension stiffness The first 2 factors decide the how much, basically the amount of traction available on the inside wheel. The 3rd factor decides the lag. Stiffer the suspension, quicker the load transfer. That's why a lot reviewers complain they aren't getting proper feedback when they are driving/riding vehicles with soft suspension, because of the lag in load transfer. Body roll is basically this 3rd factor in cars. It has nothing to do with the center of gravity of the car. So, it doesn't matter what the ground clearance is or how high the passengers are seating. Now, generally the reason we associate body roll with SUVs is because they generally tend to have softer suspensions. Softer suspensions and damping make you feel like you are floating around when the load transfer happens in corners. The added ride height of SUVs also contributes to this feeling as the car is less stable (lower weight & traction on inside wheel). Generally, you can solve or atleast significantly reduce the body roll by having stiff suspension, which will basically kill the comfort anyway.", 6th March 2022,skoda-kushaq,Gurgaon,86,198,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Neutral

2457, DocHudson , 17:15 ,Newbie,"Hello everyone! I've recently joined team-BHP and this is my first post here. Please forgive me for any noob mistakes. We recently bought a Kushaq 1.0 Ambition AT (Buying experience coming soon) and I'm planning to buy a dashcam for it. Before buying, I wanted to confirm a few things.How is the 70mai pro plus dashcam? Should I consider hardwiring the dashcam? Can I navigate the wires through the A-pillars or someplace else? Don't want the wires to be visible openly. Any other good dashcam options in the market, my budget is around 10k. Ending the dashcam discussion, my second question is, has anyone upgraded the horn in their kushaq? I'm not a fan of the original horn and the dealership has quoted 12k for the horn that comes in the Octavia/Superb. I'm looking for aftermarket options, if anyone was ever in the same boat as me, please let me know the resolution.", 26th March 2022,skoda-kushaq,Yamunanagar,19,36,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

Here are some +ive and -ive. + Built in feature like GPS & ADAS. + It comes with electrostatic sticker, so chances of 3m sticker or suction cup mount adhesive melting and sticking on wind screen are unlikely. + good image resolution and storage upto 128gb. - Product quality is questionable, its 12v usb charger has stopped working a week after the purchase and also caused a short circuit in my Kushaqs cigarette lighter(had to replace fuse, it cost me ₹34 only). So dont use that instead buy a good quality one. - You will appreciate ADAS for couple days, but there after you might feel irritated with its prompting for Lane change or vehicle ahead warnings every now and then . Yes you can navigate wires through A, B & C pillars and regarding hardwiring if you really need parking surveillance then only risk it. My SA has warned me if it cause any electrical issues then your warranty may be voided. So I didnt risked it and you can check with your own SA .

I am contemplating a Dashcam for the last couple of months and following the other Dashcam thread but scared to touch anything electrical in a Skoda due to warranty fears. I read in VW/Skoda theads that the (Cigarette lighter), 12V socket will still be ON after car is switched OFF and will keep the Dash cam powered and cause battery drain. Is it the same case in Kushaq too? I do not need parking surveillance, so hard wiring is not needed. I just want a plug and play connect to the 12V socket. I am also not too keen on sticking the Dashcam in Windshield. I was rather thinking of sticking one it in Dashboard recess area.

I drove my Kushaq 1.0 Ambition MT (delivered in July '21) for around 11000 kms in 4 months (from Sept to Dec '21) and it has been taking rest since past 3 months with occasional city rides only. Few days ago I got a call from my dealer based in Delhi that I need to bring my car to the service center for a campaign service (software update + driver side window motor change + one rear wheel hub replacement + one I don't remember now). I took the car to very recently inaugurated showroom (Singhania Skoda in Ranchi) where they couldn't do anything other than software update as parts mentioned in the campaign were not available with them (this was expected so I was not surprised). Since time has come to run the mill again on highways for long, I thought of getting the engine oil topped up a bit as 11k is quite near to 15k service mark and the oil level would be low. I asked the service adviser to top up the engine oil and they refused to do saying that they don't advise mixing new oil with contaminated old oil. I could sense lack of confidence in his words and he kept on telling your car is new and it is just a matter of 4k kms more, get it serviced then. I had topped up engine oil several times at ASC in my Vento 1.6 TDI after running 10k kms even though the service requirement was to change the oil at 15k kms. Now, this comes comes as a surprise to me.

2508, KapilD , 16:17 ,BHPian,"4000 KM update Subsequent to my last update many days ago, im jotting down the experience with the Kushaq 1.5 TSI MT Style in the recent past. 1. Once I completed 1500 kms, did an Engine oil change. No difference in performance but peace of mind that no initial new engine metal micro particles would be present. 2. Past 2500 kms, the engine has become so smooth that I never know of the engine has shut down or is idling. Absolute 0 vibration on the brake pedal and gear lever. 3. Around the 2500 km mark, the rattling noise from left A pillar cropped up, which was rectified by the service centre with padding on the cables running on the left A pillar. Seems that the clip on the pillar holding the cable is having a larger diameter than required. So the cables come off. 4. The dashboard also has a squeaky noise if pressed. It seems that there is lack of padding underneath and can be rectified at the service centre and would need 1 full day. So I reserved this work for next visit. There is no noise when driving. So no nuisance at the moment. 6. Did a long drive: Kolkata-Puri-Kolkata. Observations as under: 4 adults, 1 kid, 75% boot filled with luggage, tyre pressure: 33 PSI all around Onward Journey: Cruising at 100 kmph in 6th gear for most part of the route returned an average of 14.9 KMPL will AC running at 22* along with seat ventilation. The Return Leg: Cruising at 80 kmph in 5th gear for most part returned an average of 16.3 kmpl. All other factors remaining the same. So the observation is that the engine is able to get into 2 cylinder mode more easily when doing 80 in 5th gear @2000 rpm. It rarely got activated in 100 kmph in 6th gear @2000 rpm. So the return leg was showing a total distance to empty of 800+ KM which was pretty acceptable was compared to my Polo 1.2 GT TSI which never could do this much on 45L tank where as I can now on a 50L tank. The over all average chart is as under: The mileage in city is hovering around 12/13 kmpl as I drive most of the time in 3rd gear only and try to get the most out of the 2 cylinder mode. It feels like a nice game each time I go to office and come back. Best possible extraction of mileage.. The best I could extract with seat ventilation on and AC off, during the winter is as under: And finally a parting shot with the hot selling Korean.

Dealer took an additional 30k and provided music system, 4 speakers, bucket fit seat covers, mats and mud flap. On road price difference between this and Active variant was approx 1.3L, we bought this for our father who upgraded from Honda Brio and he is very happy with the car. The search for an upgrade began post covid 2nd wave as our very reliable Brio was nearing 10 years. We(me and my brother(another BHPian) had 10L budget in our mind and wanted to give our parents something which has decent height and drives good. I have a Polo TDI currently and my brother Jeep Compass Diesel, so one can understand how difficult it would have become for us to take a final call for the car. Cars taken into consideration- XUV 300, Kushaq, Taigun, Glanza, Kia Carens and Scross. We went ahead and booked Kia Carens after seeing the car in showroom but then thought it will be difficult to manoeuvre in traffic. Cancelled Carens and booked Glanza G with 6 airbags keeping reliability in mind. Toyota dealership experience was pretty good and we were happy to see Glanza replacing our Brio but then it was always playing in our mind that we have booked a Baleno which might have issues with build quality. TBH maruti has done a better job this time around, car feels much better when compared to last iteration. Then on a nice Sunday morning, I saw a video of BHPian Sunderdeep of Skoda Kushaq Active peace. Called my brother and asked him to check if dealership in Ahmedabad has the variant, dealership had 4 cars in stock-3 white and 1 carbon steel. Though are budget was a strict 10L we discussed and checked on our financials along with the pros and cons. Since we had already owned VAG cars earlier, we knew what we were getting. I had driven the 1L in the Polo and man that car is a stunner, so whats the negative then, lets book this my brother said. I was a bit worried if something happens to Kushaq as many have reported in the earlier versions it would be difficult for our father to manage all those useless visits to Skoda service center. Reliability was a concern we both agreed upon but then Skoda dealership experience was very good and the TD sealed the deal. Father liked Kushaq among all the cars we had shown till date so we were ready to take the risk.

Going by what I observed for in gear acceleration too, I think you should be able to take the car anywhere.

Difference between the Active Peace and Active is Rs. 1,30,000 just for the 7 inch infotainment system + speakers. Dealer is offering an Skoda approved accessory at Rs.30,000 only. So why will anyone choose the Active variant? In many states, the road tax is less under 10L as well there will be savings in the insurance. So it does not make any sense to go for Active variant. 2. Difference between Ambition Classic and Ambition is Rs. 30,000. It seems the only difference is the Auto AC. Isn't this too less value proposition for a customer to choose between these two variants? And they offer the AT in both variants with Rs. 50,000 apart. At least they should have differentiated with transmission option. Overall, this seems to be an internal margin adjustment exercise (yet again) without thinking about customer value. I must admit that I did not checked the brochure to see whether there are any other differences. Now, with the starting price of Kushaq is brought under 10L, I guess there is very less chance to get a Sub 4M (Sub Compact) Crossover from the same platform with the 1.0L TSI engine option unless Skoda springs a surprise. I thought they will launch it in a year between 8 - 11L bracket to push up the volumes from the platform. Now coming to the Monte Carlo edition, since the changes are cosmetic, it would have been better to launch it in 1.5 TSI only to give the aura of exclusive sportier variant in it.

I want to give a shoutout to the skoda RSA. As soon as I called the toll free, I was immediately assigned with an agent. He promptly replied to all my queries and made sure the flatbed reached on time. From calling the toll free to sharing all my details and confirming that I require assistance and car is not in a condition to drive, it only took the flatbed 45 minutes to reach my home. Live tracking on the skoda connect app was a boon in this situation. As soon as the car reached the service center, I got a call from my SA. He made sure everything went smoothly. I even got timely updates from the service agent about the issue and how they resolved it. They also did a software update and taping on doors to prevent rattling noises even though I had no complaints regarding this. 2 weeks after all this, I got a call from Skoda RSA services asking for my feedback and if anything can be improved. I understand Skoda has been notorious in it's services in the past but I feel they have come a long way and have improved a lot in keeping its customers happy.

Is the smaller 1.0L engine worth it? Does it feel under powered in any circumstance. Does it make sense to pay a premium for a 1.0 Litre engine?

After a few calls and telling him I will buy 2 sets (one for my friend's Rapid), he agreed for a price of 3.5k without bill (I guess i could have bargained more). I wasn't getting warranty anyway so I bought the horn and boy is it loud!! And it's not weirdly loud, it has that proper insulation and sounds really premium, It's worth every penny and I don't regret it at all.

But the moment I sat inside the Kushaq, I knew it was going to be my final choice and after TD it, I simply wasted no time in booking it.

All in all there were a few trade offs when it comes to feature while picking this over a sonet, but no waiting period and (at the risk of offending others) the feel of sitting inside a Skoda is simply much more premium and solid (imo) than a Nexon or Sonet.

But at that time there was no issues with the car. I'm guessing as I drove more, the silencer must have displaced further which later started to make that noise. I want to give a shoutout to the skoda RSA. As soon as I called the toll free, I was immediately assigned with an agent. He promptly replied to all my queries and made sure the flatbed reached on time. From calling the toll free to sharing all my details and confirming that I require assistance and car is not in a condition to drive, it only took the flatbed 45 minutes to reach my home. Live tracking on the skoda connect app was a boon in this situation. As soon as the car reached the service center, I got a call from my SA. He made sure everything went smoothly. I even got timely updates from the service agent about the issue and how they resolved it. They also did a software update and taping on doors to prevent rattling noises even though I had no complaints regarding this. 2 weeks after all this, I got a call from Skoda RSA services asking for my feedback and if anything can be improved.

Kindly help with your insights for me to take an informed decision I own the 1.5TSI Manual, so can't directly comment on the DSG performance. However, I am under the same category as you, this was my first car purchase ever and I mostly driver outside the city (road trips) since I have been working from home. For the occasional city rides, I have a motorcycle. Coming to buying a 1.5 over the 1.0, it depends on what you want. If you are single or a small family of 2-3, the 1.0TSI will do just fine. The 1.5TSI is basically a safety buffer, a peace of mind that no matter what, the car will always pull through. Recently, I did a 2 week trip in Himachal with a fully loaded car (4 passengers + luggage) and AC switched ON almost all the time and I had no trouble whatsoever even in the hairpins. The 1.5TSI is just too OP, managing to climb even in 3rd gear provided there's decent momentum. Answering whether the VAG sisters are worth it, depends on what you are looking for. The USP of both cars in the build and driveability. Drive either of the Korean sisters and Astor and then drive either of Kushaq/Taigun and you notice the difference. The ride offered is just sublime and personally, I have had fun pushing my Kushaq in the twisties considering just how stable it is. If anything, the tyres are the limiting factor than the car itself. I wouldn't dare do that in a Creta/Seltos and absolutely not in the Astor which is the least compliant among all. However, if you are sedate driver who although likes road trips, doesn't really push his car around, the other options could be better. As for the DSG, it literally is the best gearbox in terms of performance. However, this does has a compromise on reliability. This though depends on how you drive. If you are out and out enthusiast who pushes the car all the time, the gearbox will give up quickly. However, if you drive sanely, it should last you. The new generation gearboxes definitely are more reliable than the earlier ones. If you are still worried, just buy the MT version. BTW, why aren't you looking at the Slavia? It offers everything the Kushaq does and more (bigger boot, digital cluster, better beige interiors) and at lower cost. The GC is marginally lower (179 vs 189mm) which would make no difference practically and being a sedan, would be better at handling. Has anyone tried retrofitting the digital cluster in their std Kushaq? Considering that Monte Carlo is coming with the digital cluster and Slavia already has it, retrofitment technically shouldn't be a problem, rather a matter of component availability and quality of fitment.", 15th May 2022,skoda-kushaq,Gurgaon,86,198,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Apparently, there was a delay from RTO, and the dealer, itself, had received the number plate after 15 days of the car delivery. Today I went to PPS Skoda service center to get the number plate installed (with rivets). Unfortunately, due to poor workmanship, the number plate on the boot was not installed in the correct alignment (horizontal) and so was tilting on one side by half an inch. It was clearly visible and hence I immediately demanded to take the plate out and reinstall it with proper alignment. The service center person tried different tools to pop the rivet off the plate i.e. hammer and chisel, drill machine etc. Finally, he could pop one of the rivet. He tried to correct the horizontal alignment of the plate. It helped a bit but not much because of grossly misaligned holes drilled on the plate itself. The final result is that plate is still tilted on one side. It's an eyesore. So, I would like to get a new HSRP number plate. By the way, is it possible to get a new HSRP number plate issued in Bangalore? Should I ask the dealer to arrange a new one on his expenses as his person has spoiled the existing one.

2601, akkalra , 17:44 ,Newbie,"Hi Everyone, First of all, thank you for making me a part of this wonderful community. This is my first ever post on team-bhp forum and I hope I can contribute more often on this platform going forward. This post is about how I ended up buying the Skoda Kushaq 1.5 DSG - Carbon Steel in May 2022. To start with I owned VW Polo GT TDI and when I started searching for a new car, I knew I will really have limited options to match the performance of the GT TDI at a budget of INR 15-20 lakhs. My Polo GT was a beast of a car and the driving dynamics of the car were extremely good. It was a 2015 model and the only reason I wanted an upgrade was due to space crunch in the polo as the family is getting bigger and the poor road conditions around the new place I have moved to. I wanted an SUV to take care of long stretch of bad roads and pot holes that comes in my way of commute to office everyday. I also wanted a petrol car this time around given I was only able to drive my Polo for about 50 thousand kms in 7 years. Below are the details of the cars I test drove before purchasing Kushaq Jeep Compass Petrol AT: Even before test driving the car I knew from team bhp forums that this car is not loved by the enthusiast given it is made for sedate driving. I always liked the looks of the car and therefore I thought I would at least give It a try. The test drive vehicle that came to my home had clocked 5k kms on odometer and I would say it must have been handled in a pretty rough manner. The car is definitely made for relaxed driving and I had to really push the paddle hard and wait for the power to kick in. Despite the SA suggesting me that the car is not performing that great as it was not serviced at all, I was just not convinced with the overall driving dynamics. Hence Jeep was ticked off from my list. Tata Harrier: I did not want a diesel car but I did want to try the Tata Harrier as it has the X factor specially the exterior looks really good and even though I would have had to stretch my budget by about 5-6 lakhs, I thought it was worth trying at least. The car performed really well in bad stretch of road and I felt really comfortable driving the car. It did feel like a bigger car specially coming from Polo but I was not uncomfortable anytime with the size of the car. The interiors of the car especially the touch screen really needs an upgrade. However this was something I could have lived with given the car performed well in terms of driving, making me feel secure and the space it offered. I almost wanted to finalize the car but then I read a lot of horror stories on the forum about the after sale service and how it is still a half baked product. To me spending more than my intended budget and taking a leap of faith with Tata was not worth it. MG Hector and Astor: Some of my collogues in office suggested me to check out the MG products and I was not convinced given MG is a new brand and still has some work to do to build service centers. I did test drive both the cars back to back and both of them and somehow did not like both the cars. I test drove the CVT version of both the cars and the SA kept on suggesting me to test drive the turbo AT of Astor but it just does not have the road presence to spend around 20 lakh. It was just not making sense to me. Just my personal opinion. Skoda Kushaq: I know Skoda 2.0 strategy has some sort of polarizing view specially from the legacy owners of VW/Skoda cars. I feel every car in this segment has some pros and cons and therefore I went with an unbiased view while test driving the Kushaq. I did not test drive the Taigun because I liked the looks of Kushaq more subtle as Taigun and I knew Kushaq/Taigun being cousins both will offer same driving dynamics. I test drove both 1.0 and 1.5 DSG and immediately felt connected with the 1.5 DSG. The car has really good driving dynamics, still has a decent door thud ensuring safety and it did take the potholes and bad stretch of road decently well. Now I know DSG is notorious but remember I was going in for Harrier so I though lets save the money and keep it aside for DSG repairs in future. Also Skodas 4 year plus extended warranty was reassuring. I did not test drive the Koreans as some of my friends own it and I have driven their cars and did not feel the connect. Also XUV 700 was not considered given the insane amount of waiting time. I booked the car in April 2022 and got the delivery in May 2022. So far so good! Coming from a manual, the automatic does make the driving a bit relaxed. The ventilated seats- though not as good as I thought it would be do offer some comfort to the back.

Approx 10% reduction in quality of parts used, doors are not as heavy as my Polo but they are more than decent-better than Honda Brio/Amaze (we upgraded from Honda brio so the comparison). Door thuds are still good. 3. For a turbo petrol, mileage returned was good. We were cruising on expressway stretches at 110-115 before that annoying 120 speed warning starts singing. 4. Boot space might look small on paper but is very usable-feels more than Creta/Seltos. Loading lip is a bit higher which might be a concern for lifting heavy luggage out. 5. I found the handling to be better for most of the part, stance of the car is more car like than a forcefully raised hatchback. 6. Rear seats are very comfortable for 4, 5th passenger won't be happy for a distance of more than 100km until 2 out of the 3 are kids. Ride quality is decent with the suspension on the stiffer side.

AC system turns off recirculation when Auto mode is turned on!, In a dusty country as India , I would never turn off auto recirculation. Clutch is bit on the stiffer side. The clutch actuation is a bit springy and almost similar/ heavier than the Dzire's clutch. Interiors are fairly decent and would last a long time. The hard touch plastics everywhere don't bother us and frankly the upkeep on leather/ soft touch interiors is too steep IMO.

Here's what's mentioned in the Kushaq brochure: ""EDS helps to stabilise the vehicle when driving on road surfaces with different grip under the individual wheels. XDS+ helps to keep the vehicle on the turn by effectively braking the wheels on the inner side of the turn. XDS is functional up to 30km/hr."" As for the second part of your query: I've been using my Kushaq since Nov 2021 for my frequent work trips in the Nilgiris. In fact, I've just completed my 15k service yesterday and I'm pretty sure that approx. 40% of the 15k clocked has been on the hill roads of the Nilgiris. The Kushaq's driving dynamics are excellent for this kind of usage. There is some body roll felt by the back seat passengers, but not such that they are thrown about. Since most of my work trips are done solo, I've noted that the Kushaq feels confidently planted on the curves even at higher speeds. I'm on the stock MRF Wanderers provided. About the performance on bad terrains - well, my city doesn't seem to have any tarred roads left and the Kushaq's ride quality/handling/cabin comfort is fine. I wouldn't say it's plush but whenever I've had to go to some off road trails for my work, it certainly has handled the rough terrains quite well. I suppose the key is to use it for what it actually is: a spacious hatchback with a wee bit more GC & not an SUV (compact or whatever).", 5th June 2022,skoda-kushaq,CBE,213,"1,352",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
2634, thanixravindran , 20:44 ,BHPian,"I have used my Kushaq 1.0 MT heavily in the last few days for a family wedding at Chennai. It was used with dense traffic inside the city for running multiple errands, idling multiple times as well good speed run in Chennai bypass. Family loved it as they are quite comfortable and felt fresh being ferried around at any point of day. I did not drove but a temporary experienced driver drove it and he loved driving it effortlessly in the city traffic. AC performance: First day found the AC to be slightly underwhelming in the middle of the day but once I reduced the AC temperature to below 20degC, it was okay. I neither faced any sweating on my shirt (like in my earlier trip) in the hot and humid Chennai weather nor any issues with AC cutting off even in the (in)famous Nelson Manickam road traffic crawls during the afternoons. I have used it in both modes always in air re-circulation setting - Auto mode initially to get the cooling though it is noisy and then manual mode to maintain it. Did not bothered about fuel efficiency but MID fuel efficiency is 12Km/L but will post the accurate measure in next tank up. Some quirks/observations - It sometimes does not connect to Jio dongle (WiFi icon is OFF) and hence that trip is lost in the My Skoda connect app. But even in the unconnected trip, the notification always comes for speed alert. I have logged out of Jio motive app and use now the My Skoda connect app but Jio app still pushes all the notifications. So the notifications are now duplicated in the phone Driver side Window Auto Up/Down often acts up. Have already tried the soft reset written here and it temporarily solves the problem. Our driver only used it for Auto down and he holds the button manually Close Up the window. I believe the software is buggy as it loses the end points calibration and can be easily fixed in a update. When idling during a shopping stop, car was idling for more than 20 minutes and couple of times, there is a notification on the mobile app to stop the engine as the car is idling. There is no info whether it is just a reminder to turn off (Caring for environment) or a warning to switch the engine off (Caring for warranty & wallet). I have read idling is not good for Turbo engines. Can someone provide details regarding the same? I have idled my i10 1.2 NA engine with AC ON even more than 30 minutes and never bothered on it. With Skoda, I am always worried and not willing to take any chances. Trivia - Skoda manual recommends keeping the interior temperature (set point) of not more than 5 degC from outside temperature. All the best if you try to follow it Edit: It was driven about 500Kms in 4 days all in the Chennai City and Suburbs, if it helps.", 5th June 2022,skoda-kushaq,Chennai,554,"2,725",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

If you have Goodyear Assurance Triplemax, you'll get the Primacy 4 ST for 23,000. This was done in Ashoka Tyres,Hyderabad. The only sizes Michelin's are available in India for the Kushaq are either 215/55/17 or 225/50/17 where 225 is the closest to the original spec, but the 6.5J stock alloys would damage the 225 section tyres very fast IMO. That's the main reason I went for 215/55/17. The stock tyre size has very little choices and almost all choices in stock size are either average or very expensive.(Pirelli Runflats are very expensive and not worth the hassle.) Economy will dip by 5-10% in my observation compared to stock size but the excellent grip and low cabin noise make up for the dip. The car has very little road noise even at speeds of 120-130 Km/h.

2661, vishal_b , 02:00 ,Newbie,"We recently upgraded the wheels on my cousin's Kushaq Peace Active in Bangalore. After much deliberation, some cost-benefit assessment and a lot of search for the 17 inch OEM alloys, we landed at Madhu's at Wilson Garden! Choice of tyres We were certain that we want to go with Michelins. As per our research, the closest sizes to the OEM size were 215/55/R17 and 225/50/R17. We also briefly considered 215/60/R17, as they were significantly cheaper, but the increase in overall diameter was >5%, so we summarily rejected that spec. So, now the decision was between 215/55/R17 Primacy 4ST and 225/50/R17 Pilot Sport 4. I am sure many others will also be confused between these two sizes, so I am briefly listing down the pros and cons for each: 215/55/R17 - Primacy 4 ST Pros: 1. Good sidewall size and hence a cushier and more comfortable ride; 2. Tyre width only 10 mm bigger than the stock size tyres, so a comfortable fit on the 6.5J Skoda OEM alloys 3. Easily available tyre size Cons: 1. Not as attractive looking as the 225/50/R17 (because of the slightly bigger profile) 2. Slightly more expensive than the 225/50/R17 225/50/R17 - Pilot Sport 4 Pros: 1. Exact diameter as the stock size tyres 2. Wider tyres, so better grip 3. Better looking tyres with lower profile 4. PS4 is a slightly superior Michelin product in terms of ride quality, road noise and stopping distance Cons: 1. Significantly lower profile from the stock 16 inch tyres, hence perceived risk of poor ride comfort 2. Significantly wider tyres from the stock size tyres, hence a little bulging of sidewalls on the relatively narrower 6.5J OEM Skoda alloys. 7J would be ideal, but 6.5J is also acceptable. 3. Perceived stiffness in the steering feel due to significantly wider tyres The decision making Once we had the above analysis clear in our head, Mohsin from Madhu's made the decision making clear by suggesting the 225/50/R17 PS4s. He allayed our apprehensions about the not so wide alloys and the potential stiffness in steering feel. We also physically saw the tyres next to each other. True to their name, the PS4s do look comparatively sportier. Keeping all this in mind, we decided to go with the 225/50/R17 PS4s. The Experience at Madhu's The experience at Madhu's was brilliant, right from Mohsin's expert advice, to Islam's meticulousness in fitting the tyres - everything felt very reassuring. Also, the tyres were manufactured in Nov 2021. While the overall outgo for the tyres and the fitment was about Rs.2-3k higher than the best rate in the market, I would happily go to Madhu's again as the cost is fully justified by the professionalism with which they operate. [b]Initial impressions[b] While we are yet to take the car out for a proper spin on the highways, but immediately upon the installation and a short drive back home, the following became clear: 1. The wheels look slick and provide a massive improvement in the overall look of the car. 2. The steering feels great - not stiff at all. 3. The ride comfort doesn't seem compromised at all, if anything, minor road bumps feel smoothened and blunted now. 4. Can't comment on the road grip yet, but theoretically it is bound to have gotten better on account of the wider tyres and better compound.

Same in my Slavia since I tried this today. In manual mode, early upshift to 2 is not allowed whereas in D mode it does that as soon as car starts moving. I guess this is normal since in D mode there is also some clutch slippage done in D1 and D2 to create a smooth ride, whereas in M2 that does not happen. Hence it requires you to accelerate a bit more in M1 before the shift to M2 is allowed. Initially I thought it was an issue but both using paddle shifters and the tip tronic, shift isnt allowed.

We visited Chennai, Thiruvannamalai and Kanchi as part of our plan to explore the amazing architecture and the temples in these areas. Car returned 16.8 Km/L when doing tankful-tankful calculations even though I'm running on an upsized tyre and was cruising triple digits all day long. Average speed was 70 Km/h. Really impressed with this figure. Car was very comfortable for long distances and I can safely say that the ventilated seats are life savers. Now everyone in the family fights for the front seat. This was not the case in our Dzire. While going to Chennai, I had driven 80% of the journey while my Dad took over for the last 20%. I had just returned from abroad and the thought of going on a road trip just excited me and I was off!. We started at 8 in the morning and we reached Chennai in 9 Hours including breaks. I was really happy doing triple digits and overtaking almost every vehicle on the road safely. We never felt any fatigue or need to take a break. After 3,000 Kms, I have a few dislikes which I haven't been able to make peace with.If you are an aggressive driver, who has driven a diesel previously, you will not like the mileage when you drive the Kushaq the same way. I tried this and you would average high single digits or low double digits on the highway. Skoda Part turn around time is really horrible and they need to get their stuff together. The back quarter panel glass had cracked due to the error of the PPF applicator. They owned up to the mistake and wanted to replace the glass from the service centre. They had ordered the part 1 month ago with my Chassis number, but received the part for the opposite side. Skoda is still asking another 7 days and saying the part is in transit. AC is noisy at higher blower speeds and the Recirculation turns off randomly. Im thinking to get the recirculation memory enabled through coding.(This is done in various VAG cars like Tiguan and Kodiaq). Wireless charger does not work 90% of the time.(Not a deal breaker, but still I am going to get it checked next week or so.)

Not sure if the low temperature in the region was affecting the coolant. Typically the capacity of coolant in the vehicle would be around 6 odd litres. Of this perhaps 3.5 litres will be circulating around in the radiator and engine keeping things cool and at even temperatures. And the rest will be visible in the coolant reservoir where ideally one should never let it go below the Min Mark and at the same time one mustnt over fill above the Max mark. Low coolant can damage the engine and Over filling can damage the coolant pump, and hoses and connectors. It is quite normal for the coolant to expand and contract to some extent like any other fluid on account of temperature. (It literally builds up a head of steam). Which is why it is never recommended to open the radiator cap and/ or the coolant reservoir cap when the engine is hot. Which in turn, is why you will find that the coolant level typically will show a little higher in the reservoir after driving. And when at rest it will come down a little. But I have never until now heard of the Low Coolant lamp and warning coming on because of low temperatures and consequent contraction of coolant fluid. In matters of Coolant level, Oil level, brake fluid etc I go by visual cues and feel more than anything else.

Although I would recommend that you try negotiating a bit harder and insist your sales advisor to match the quote with the one you have chosen. Even if the dealer's quote is 3-5K more than yours, get it from the dealer itself. Reason = Hassle free insurance claims and thus peace of mind.

General consensus in this forum is to get EW for European cars for peace of mind. You can decide on this if you plan to keep the car beyond 4 years. I have not taken during the purchase and planning to take it now as the cost is 26,999 till 6 months of sale. You can take it later too at slightly increased cost. Check whether they are giving any discounts on it from both Skoda and dealer side. I have asked now whether there is any anniversary offer available but got a negative reply. 2. This is insurance and service package Drive assure economy is Basic Comprehensive insurance. Drive assure elite is Zero dep and other covers added. This is all Skoda assurance which in turn will be insured with 2 or 3 insurers by Skoda as agent in between. You can check it in Skoda website itself. If dealer is offering insurance or you are taking outside, this is not needed. SMP is 4 years (4 service) service package. I took it as anyway the cost of service will be higher in next 4 years but got it discounted at 16,999. It was given free also some point of time. Please check offers from Skoda and dealer. 3. Insurance from dealer will always be higher due to the big fat commission. Check which insurer dealer is showing 65k, and get your quote from outside for same insurer and give it to them to price match and they will do it mostly. I went with HDFC Ergo which seems good on paper. 4. FasTag is needed during registration to be verified by RTO but only physically as he is not checking the Tag tied with Engine/Chassis number. So I asked my dealer to get it done with just another Tag (what is the use of ticket holder otherwise ) and then got it from my preferred vendor at Rs.350 after I purchased and registered the car. Some banks like ICICI or HDFC offer it free of cost for their customers. You can do it if you wish. 5. I did not opt for it as I felt it was quite useless for me. Once again, I purchase accessories separately and don't mix with car purchase. 6. Please provide the quote/calculations so that it can be verified easily. Just remove all the costs like insurance, FasTag, SMP, EW (I never mix these things during car purchase) etc all of which can be done by you. For a car to be sold by dealer, the minimum should only be Ex-showroom, discount at base price with GST added if any, 1% TCS on invoice (discounted price) and finally RTO charges added to it for registration. PS: I remember Skoda was offering some discount for booking Kushaq with HDFC Regalia credit card sometime back and check whether it will be of use to you if you have it.", 6th July 2022,skoda-kushaq,Chennai,554,"2,725",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Don't buy Acko, it's cheap for a reason. I haven't read great reviews and HDFC generally is a safe choice. With that said, I bought my Future Generalli insurance from the dealer and I got a good deal (don't remember exact amount, but it was around 45k or so and was on par with HDFC) and it included a lot of add-ons. Haggle with them. Only advantage of buying from dealer is they can raise a claim directly in case of repairs since they have a tie up with the insurance company. 4. Buy the Fastag yourself, that provides you with a choice from whom to buy. Plus, the dealers can mess up. I have seen couple of customers here whose Fastag didn't work from the get-go because the dealer messed up the kyc. Get Airtel if you already haven't bought. Banks have zero customer support in case of issues 5. Skip the accessories. I fought hard with the dealer to provide for free and I only got the rubber mud mats and door blinds. Everything else is pointless 6. Discount will depend on the dealer. Just inquire about maintenance package, are they still offering for 16k? At 25k, it isn't value for money since the standard service cost itself will add up to approx 28k.

Quote: Hot on the heels of a record-breaking June (5,023 units) and H1 2022 (28,899 units), Skoda Auto India has introduced a host of updates and changes to its Kushaq SUV as part of the cars first anniversary celebrations in India. Quote: The Kushaq range gets a new headliner in the cabin and a Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) as standard across the range. Moreover, all variants powered by the 1.0 TSI are equipped with the Start-Stop Recuperation system as standard. This has improved fuel efficiency by 7-9%. The interiors now get a 20.32cm Skoda Infotainment System with knobs and buttons for select functions increasing ergonomics and ease of use for the driver. Another addition is the Non-Sunroof (NSR) Style trim. It sits between the current Ambition and Style variants. The NSR Style variant is based on the 1.0 TSI Style. It will offer a 4-dial medium analogue instrument cluster and will be exclusive with the 6-speed manual transmission, thus offering one more value price-point for the customer. The top-of-the-line Style variant with the Sunroof is now upgraded with a 20.32cm Skoda Virtual Cockpit for the drivers instrument console in place of analogue dials.

2749, RijuC , 13:56 ,BHPian,"Yesterday I had the TD of Kushaq 1.0 TSI AT: Target variant Ambition Classic 1.0 AT. The white colour test drive vehicle was brand new, just arrived at Ring Road Skoda, Golf Course road Mega Mall, Gurgaon. The SA Mr. Jeetender and his colleagues were very courteous and helpful and explained features and customer feedbacks beautifully. They had many options of test drive vehicles. The ODO reading was at 39 Km only. The route selected was towards Pahadi road from Sikanderpur and after few turns, back to Golf course road. This route didn't have any potholes or broken patches. However, I took the car through the studs on road and few small broken patches on the side. Cabin was silent, audio quality was acceptable (we prefer to enjoy music at home. Acceptable quality inside car is ok for both of us). The foot print / dimension of the Kushaq was just adequate for us. Visibility was very good. No problem of A pillar blocking the vision (I drove the Harrier just after 30 minutes, the A-pillar was obstructing the view in every turns). I set the AC at 22 deg C. Wife complained at rear seat that it was not adequate and felt just like our Swift. I would like to have another longer TD with AC set at lower temp. On some potholes and stone laden roads. Drove the car upto 70 km maximum, and with 3 persons on-board without any luggage, the power seems to be adequate for my use. I loved the feel of the steering and the entire control console in front of me. There was no knee and central console wall interference. Observation: 1. Technical - This brand new car has a loud bang/ clang sound and little vibration due to this banging of something metallic whenever I pressed the brake pedal. The SA told it happens in all brand new cars. Is it true? It didn't happen to my earlier brand new cars- Zen Estilo 2009 and Swift 2016. 2. Seats: Rear passenger seats were too upright. 3. Headrests: Worst quality headrest I have ever seen. The headrests of my Swift are firmer, chunkier, properly stitched. 4. Commerical- The dealership says maximum extended warranty is upto 6th year. Is it upto 6th year or 7th year? In many threads I remember it was mentioned as 7th year. The dealership is open for negotiation for price. Also, they agreed for another TD. I would like to drive the 1.5 TSI DSG as well. If I shift it to neutral position always at traffic signals or in bumper to bumper can I extend life of DSG or it is destiny that DSG will fail every year? Overall, we loved Kushaq otherwise except this brake issue in brand new car. Side note: I really liked the Exterior and Interior of Slavia.

Ive TDd 3 variants of Kushaq. None had this. So the SA is bluffing. The only sound which comes is of the autohold brakes releasing which makes the sound of rubber releasing the hold of a vaccum hold on metal. 4th point, Skoda gives 4 std + 2 ext warranty, whereas VW gives 7. 4+2+1. Not sure if the +1 is still available. I had it during my Polo GT TSI days. Coming to the DSG woes, it depends on the way you drive it. If you are always crawling with half pressed brakes and stopping without fully pressing the brakes, you will get a failed gearbox/clutch assembly soon. Clutch pack is 70K if im not mistaken. I drove without going into N on signals, staying on D all times on my GT TSI with fully pressed brakes all times and whenever moving forward, the foot was never on the brakes. So it lasted me 7 years without trouble of mechatronics. The only thing which I faced it the flywheel and water pump problem as I used to redline the engine in 3rd or 4th gear while almost every time overtaking on highways. So the torque took a toll on these parts. Flywheel alone cost was more than 30000. The above is absolutely as per my experience.

Nevertheless, will be completing a year of owning this pocket rocket this month, it has been an incredible journey so far with loads of fun and memory to cherish. A detailed write-up on how the journey has held up so far in my thread is on the way. Replaced the stock pedals with MC`s aluminum pedals, as Tafe had them in stock, and the same was priced around 800 including GST. So people in Bangalore, if you have been envious of getting yourselves sporty pedals for MT, then do rush to Tafe. Apart from routine service, there was no major issue reported except for the right side window motor which was replaced as one touchdown was sometimes getting stuck. Overall I would say Tafe, Kudlu gate did a good job and since I had SMP, the overall bill came around 2k which included a set of front wiper blades, air filter, and aluminum pedals.

I was actually more interested to replace the stock grill with the one from Kushaq Monte Carlo because you can`t expect to achieve a factory finish from outside shops. But I didn`t get an encouraging response from SVC so had to resort to this approach. As far as wrap goes, from a cost perspective, even though vinyl is cheaper but it is prone to pulling up in places and the final outcome also depends on the skill and quality of wrap involved. Also, you need to be beware of things like car washes and power sprayers if you go this route. Quote: Have you also painted the window chrome lines?

I have seen cars way cheaper than kushaq with proper frameless wipers. Ever since I read BHPian @Atharva14's thread on how he replaced the rear wiper of his Taigun with that of a Polo, I have wanted to do the same. The only thing I was concerned about was that it was not an exact replacement, you would have to do some adjustments to make it work. I continued my search and found the below video where brezza's wiper is used to replace the wiper of another Taigun and is a direct replacement. You can also refer this video for the process of how to change the arm of the wiper. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbOaGJIT1AI&t=110s I know it's just aesthetics but I liked the design of polo's rear wiper more than brezza, it just looks more premium. So I went ahead and ordered the arm and blade for polo from amazon. Link: https://www.amazon.in/AutoClean-Teflon-Coated-Wiper-Volkswagen/dp/B081NQT5XL/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3Q6RZWNOKF627&keywords=polo+rear+w iper&qid=1660308809&sprefix=polo+rear%2Caps%2C233& sr=8-2 I had to go to my local mechanic to get that pulling bearer mentioned in the video. The tricky part that @Atharva14 mentioned was the size of the blade, it's an inch bigger and gets stuck under the spoiler. All I did was pushed the lock of the blade a few cms towards right and voila!, the wiper works without any problems whatsoever. I didn't have to use any adhesive, you just press the two beads on the lock of the blade, move towards right and release them and it locks itself. I apologize as I don't have any photos of the whole process but I will attach the before and after photo. You can checkout the below link for Taigun's wiper replacement.

One option is to have a USB A to C converter and plug it to the phone charging port. If you are worried it won't supply enough power, I have used my GoPro that way a lot when it gets discharged.

An interesting update. Spoke with the SA and the GM. I asked about the decrease in screen size and the deletion of features. I told him how important wireless CarPlay is to me. He said hell get back to me as there are very few unsold units with the 10 inch screen (with the subwoofer and wireless CarPlay) left at the factory and the company would allocate this stock to the dealer. He got back to me an hour ago and told theres one white 1.5 DSG available with the 10 inch screen. The grey I wanted isnt available. I asked him to find out the VIN number so that we can decode the manufactured month. Its just that I cant decide if this a good decision. Old leftover stock at the factory vs newly manufactured car. God knows how the old white one was taken care of. Do you think its safe to purchase the white 1.5 with the 10 inch screen?

I have checked various cars in sub 4 meter segment like Nissan magnite, Suzuki Breeza, Tata Nexon, Mahindra XUV3OO and found that rear seat leg room is inadequate. Last week I test drive the Taigun 1litre TSI version and found it better. Leg room in rear seat is very good. Boot space was also adequate. I also checked the Kushaq Taigun Amibition classic version of it, both looked similar in terms of boot and seat comfort. Finally decided to book either Taigun highline or Kushaq Ambition classic. But later read reviews in this thread and found that there AC issues in Taigun and Kushaq. Some also reported door rattling and gear shift issues. Are these issues fixed?

Hey!, congrats on the new Kushaq!, 1.5 DSG is a beast and you would love your time with it!. 1. After 6,000 Kms, overall performance of the tyres are amazing. There is a noticeable difference when compared to the stock MRF's which come stock with the car. The road noise is very little and the overall comfort is really good. Would totally recommend. Stock MRF's are noisy and are not great compared to P4ST's. The wet grip is really good as well. Just that, these tyres are not made to have the least rolling resistance, so when compared to the Energy series, these tend to give a little less mileage.(But totally worth for the Silent Thread) 2. There is a small drop in fuel efficiency. I usually get around 9-10Km/L in the city and upto 12-13 if there's little traffic. I'm running the tyres on 34PSI as I've found this to be a great balance b/w comfort and FE. For very short distance runs (Less than 2-3 Km), the car returns around 7Km/l anything above 5 Km, the car should return 9Km/L to 13 Km/L depending on the traffic. ( My long term trip meter shows that I had around 13.2Km/L for 1320 Km. This was done in 80% city and 20% in Hyderabad's beautiful ORR.) 3.I had enquired a lot of people and received a response saying that they cannot deny the entire car's warranty(Just that if a trivial thing such as suspension fails, they would not honour it, but suspensions rarely fail). As the upsize is 1.6% a lot of them said that it won't matter. Ex: if an electrical item fails, they cannot deny saying that upsizing the tyre has caused this to happen. I had my viper blades harden in 3 months, Skoda decided to replace it under warranty.

2805, smilingakash , 11:06 ,BHPian,"I took a TD for 1.5 DSG yesterday (will take another one for manual soon). Monte Carlo Edition Interiors- The pictures for its interiors online were ugly and I did not want to sit in ONE. The SA still wanted me to check this one out. I can safely say the looks are polarizing- Some people will hate it and some will truly dig the sporty feeling. Exteriors- Hands down, everyone loved the exterior treatment for Monte Carlo Edition Is it worth it additional 80k over the 6 Airbag Top variant? - If wireless Android Auto/ Apple Car Play are must for you then this is the only current edition in Kushaq which offers the same. Also, the unit has a 10 inch screen (as offered initially by Skoda). - Better sound quality with Sub-Woofer. Good for music buffs but if you are not too keen on music, this is not the most important factor. - Exterior and Interior cosmetic features are a plenty with lot of Monte Carlo Badging Monte Carlo edition also has 6 Airbags so if that is a priority for you, then only Monte Carlo and Top model Skoda (Style with 6AB) will fit your bill. DSG Drive DSG is a hoot to drive However, coming from a Duster, the assured feeling with acceleration was somewhat missing. In no way, Skoda felt light but Duster always feels a lot more comfortable with sudden acceleration surges (Perhaps my love for the car over 10 years). What I liked about Kushaq was it felt like a very easy car to maneuver in tight areas, parking etc. Felt a lot smaller while driving and that makes it very good for the city ride. Has enough juice (1.5 version) for good highway runs as well. Boot Space After Hyryder disappointment (I still have the booking), I have started looking for backups. Budget is flexible 20-35L but in NCR due to no-diesel mantra, the options surprisingly become very limited. Unless Hyryder makes practical sense (Will check if by removing the parcel tray and false tray, the weekend luggage is feasible), I may have to cancel the booking. Now, the Kushaq boot space. On paper it says 385L (less than Duster). However, I have learnt to take these figures with a pinch of salt (Case in point with boot space figures of Creta which in real life do not equate to same usable bootspace). Pleasantly surprised by the height provided. Make no mistake guys, the usable boot space is good in Kushaq. If you are like me worried about boot space in this car then you can put your doubts to rest Back seat comfort Seats are alright- No complaints there. But can you seat 3 healthy adults on the back seat for a long trip? Sadly the answer is NO. The only 5 seater cars (20-35L Budget) which can do this today are Duster, Creta, Tucson and City. Even Jeep Compass fails the back seat width criteria. You can always buy a 7 seater and use the last row for your boot. Case in point- Carens, Alcazar, Innova. However the 7 seaters are too long for most people and are often chauffeur driven. So if you are a family, which often seats 5 then your options are limited. For city runs, it should not be a problem. However, for long highway runs, the comfort for 3 adults in the backseat is highly questionable. Worth spending 22-23 L for Top Model (6AB version)/Monte Carlo? Kushaq has niggles but also is perhaps the best to drive (Even compass DDCT is laggy). Average is decent for a petrol SUV. However, for this money there are options in the market. Hyryder/Vitara hybrid models will be in direct competition. Also, the omnipotent Korean twins which are the behemoth in this segment. Yes, we do not like them for average safety and banality of their presence on the roads. However, Creta is still the most spacious, has Hyundai reliability and has great resale value. Join the circus of conundrums before buying Kushaq.

2808, Blanktrails , 10:25 ,Newbie,"Got delivery of my Kushaq Ambition Classic AT this week. It's second Kushaq in the family. My brother had bought Kushaq Ambition AT six months back. I had considered Seltos IMT and IVT models primarily other than Kushaq. IMT couldn't match the convenience of AT. Seltos IVT felt good but driving feel was slightly poorer to Kushaq. Further, the middle seat in Seltos was really bad in our opinion due to protruding arm rest. There were no discount on Seltos and waiting period was also too high. After driving Kushaq and seeing the final price I had to pay for Kushaq vs Seltos IVT, I decided to buy Kushaq. Got discount of 1.15 lakh on on-road price inclusive of all add ons. I paid 14.75 lakh for car with BH series registration, Extended Warranty, 4 year service package and Skoda Accessories Kit for ambition classic model. Kit includes black roof wrap, seat cover, chrome garnishes. Its a July 2022 manufactured car. Observations after driving around 200km: 1. In city fuel economy displayed was 12 kmpl. On Mumbai Pune Highway, it was 15 kmpl. 2. Even the manual AC on ambition classic is not strong. On AC temp set at lowest and fan at 2, the cabin was not cool enough. Temp displayed on driver's display didn't go below 29.5 celcius in sunny weather. This is my biggest disappointment with the car. 3. Car drives well in city and on highway. No problems with power or steering. I do feel car veers off to left if I leave steering. But need to test it more. I'm not sure it's normal though. 4. Sound quality is just adequate. At high volume, its very lackluster. Bass is weak. However, for low volume, it's good enough. Can't see myself enjoying it too much with EDM or Punjabi dance music. A major gripe I have with Skoda is lack of accessories or option to modify. Even neck rest are not available in official accessories list. There is no option to improve sound quality. In comparison, Hyundai lists so many accessories for creta, multiple choices in each segment.

After repeated explanations of how the excess amount is ""somehow"" related to the SMP package, and with me raising more questions on their explanation (as it is complimentary), There is a latest explanation as mentioned below. They gave me a new corrected tax invoice document for the car which has a lower special discount component, so that it almost covers the excess amount I paid to them. The old net ex-showroom price was 18,24,000 and the new one is 18,39,000. I'm not sure how they can generate another invoice for the car. The invoice number is also different. The original invoice has the date as ""27th June"" (payment date) and the new one has ""29th June"" (car delivered date). I don't know if they actually created it on 29th June or just yesterday with that date. They are claiming that it was a mistake and they corrected it. Has anyone come across this? Doesn't make sense to me as the TCS (1%) amount is also higher now (I see the old amount reflected correctly in my Form 26AS). Also, I'm thinking of escalating it to Skoda as this has been going on for quite a long time. I'm yet to get back to the dealer on this explanation.

I have been following this thread for quite some time and I must congratulate the participants for such quality and in depth discussion. Previously I purchased Duster AWD 122 based on reviews of bhpians and still cherishing the decision I took despite all the noise regarding injector failure. I have done 800000 kms in my duster.. have crossed rivers climbed mountains numerous time with fair bit of offroading and it never gave a single major glitch. Hence the decision for going with Kushaq despite EPC horror stories was not a difficult one for me. Now I want a bit of help as I can still change the variant. Pls help me in choosing the correct variant by answering following questions : 1. What extra will I get in style variant over ambition apart from sun roof which I don't need anyway.. and is it worth spending extra 2lakhs 2. MT vs AT in 1.9 3. Honey Orange or Red..

I don't think anyone here would know the each and exact difference. But on top of my head, style has six airbags, leather seats, ventilated seats, 17 inch wheels vs 16, diamond cut alloy wheels vs normal ones, LCD instrument cluster vs analogue one, rain sensing wipers, automatic headlamps, sunroof. Some features might be there in ambition too, check skoda website to be completely sure. I think that's a good set of features, it all depends whether you find them useful and worth 2 lakhs or not. Colour choice is always upto you, but if you're asking, honey orange is last on the list according to me.

2836, djangokl , 15:42 ,Newbie,"I got my KUSHAQ around 5 weeks ago and have completed almost 4000km. I think it is time to share a small initial ownership review. My car is a 1.0Ltr Automatic Ambition (old model, with automatic AC, April 2022 made). Purchased from EVM Skoda, Kochi. The entire booking & delivery experience was smooth. They promptly informed us about the car's status (starting from the plant) and called for the PDI as soon as it arrived at their yard. Overall it took only 14 days (2 weeks) to book & take delivery. Speaking of driving experience, remember my previous car was a 2015 Figo Aspire 1.5ltr Diesel manual. So all my comparisons are related to my last car as well. I love to drive. I am the kind of person who uses the car to go to point A to point B just to enjoy the drive. In that sense, KUSHAQ is an absolute pleasure to drive. It is the best drivers car in the segment. It feels well planted to the road, cornering always puts a smile on my face. Basically, thats what I want from my car. I dont care it doesnt come with a 360-degree camera or other state-of-the-art goodies. Let me point out a few pros & cons. Pros:Outstanding driving comfort and stability. The car is truly peppy and sports mode makes it even better. Breaking. Gives a tremendous amount of confidence. Have been a lifesaver in a couple of situations already. Headlights (maybe my previous cars headlights were too poor). Small small ""simply clever"" features from Skoda like how indicators work when hazard lights are on, how the boot space will prevent locking itself out if the key is inside the car..etc. Torque converter: such a brilliant gearbox. It is clever enough to understand my input and behave accordingly. Almost never used paddle shifters. Maybe one or two times on highway overtake when I was having a full load. Cons:Power window noise. Milage of 1Ltr automatic: I am from a state in India which have the smallest highways and 0 access controlled highways, Kerala. Roads are decent enough but not big enough. All the mileage screenshots I saw in this group before the purchase were from outside Kerala mostly. I am fully aware of that too. So with my usage of daily city commute + weekend highway run, I am having an average of 13kmpl. City mileage is around 10 to 12kmpl depending on the traffic. The worst mileage I saw so far during daily office run (7km) was 9kmpl. Remember, traffic in Kochi during the morning time is hectic. The car never goes beyond 2nd gear. On the highway, during the night I have managed to pull off 19kmpl once. I dont drive for mileage. I dont really look at 2000 rpm usually. So there is that. Overall, this car is a gem of a machine.

2837, _Piyush_ , 12:03 ,BHPian,"Greetings fellow BHPians, This is the second post that I am writing on the forum, this is going to be a recap of September and October 2021. It is gonna be a long post with different parts My father switched his job in August Last year, following which he had to relocate to Mumbai, which meant that the 2.4 Innova ZX we had was gonna leave the garage and my elder brother obtained his MBBS Degree which implied that the 2017 Honda City needed to be with him due to odd working hours of MBBS interns in India. So, towards the end of August, we started to look for a second vehicle. My dad really wanted to get the Innova again, but a 6-7 seater was ruled out due to the non-usage of 3rd Row Seats on a daily basis. Our limit was about 20 Lacs OTR (Ghaziabad) for any 5-seater. Sedans were ruled out due to two reasons 1) we had a 2017 Honda City VX MT 2) Only three sedans dominated the market under 20Lacs out of which one was already owned by us. the only viable option left was the Compact SUV Segment which I realized was so densely packed with options that shortlisting cars became more of a hassle. Cars Shortlisted 1. Skoda Kushaq 2.Hyundai Creta 3. Kia Seltos 4. Tata Harrier 5. Volkswagen Taigun 6. Mahindra XUV 300 7. Hyundai Venue 8. Tata Nexon Starting august end, every day I woke up I would just see different reviews and read about the cars which could possibly end up in our garage. Me, my elder brother and dad decided to go and TD the shortlisted cars, which are penned down here under. 1. Hyundai Creta Pros: 3 Adults can sit comfortably (all three of us are near about 5'7) Connected Car Tech Panoramic SunRoof Rear window curtain blinds Hyundai's diesel engines are an absolute hoot to drive Cons: The turbo Petrol just did not make me smile enough. the newer generation styling was not my cup of tea. Absurd waiting periods (was Quoted beyond 9 months for black color top variants irrespective of the engine options) 2. Kia Seltos did not even TD as Dad had concerns regarding the build quality and safety of the car. 3. Tata Harrier Pros: Huge Boot Ample Leg room and Headroom Panoramic Sun Roof FCA sourced Engine is amazing and the 6speed TC was working flawlessly. The design was liked by everyone in my family Cons: Harrier poses a challenge of finding parking spots in NCR Parts sourced from different manufacturers made me question the long-term reliability. Read about the horror stories of TATA ASS Felt that the suspension is a bit stiff. No LED's even in the top-end variants... Why TATA? The infotainment system somewhat felt lacking in comparison to what others had to offer. Mahindra XUV 300, Hyundai Venue, and Tata Nexon were rejected as my father felt they are quite small belonging to the Sub-Compact SUV segment. Skoda Kushaq 1.0 TSI AT Pros: Solid Build Quality. German Engineering Unique Styling (Standouts between the million Seltos and Creta which are running on Indian Roads) 1.0 TSI with 6-Speed TC was and is one of the best cars for day-to-day city driving. Boot Space on paper looked small but in terms of practicality I found it bigger in comparison to Hyundai Creta the dashboard looks amazing. UNMATCHED driving dynamics in this segment. even though it is small in size, it has plenty of legroom and knee room on offer in the 2nd row. Cons: just 2 airbags in the top-end Style AT EPC error 4 seater in reality lack of Electric adjust Lack of Digital Tachometer appears to be a Crossover rather than a CSUV Skoda Service (based on what I had heard at that time, have different opinions now) Lack of Aftermarket accessories Volkswagen Taigun Mechanically same as the Kushaq Only the design is different. The process of test driving cars took us almost 2 weeks and reading on Team-BHP and other platforms about the shortlisted cars put me in a greater dilemma. One big issue for us was the need for another car as soon as possible, while the other was no diesel until it is a 6 or 7 seater, which ultimately left us with two choices Skoda Kushaq and Hyundai Creta, we were just about to book the top Spec Creta turbo Petrol, but I suddenly came across a post that Skoda is going to produce Style AT with 6 airbags. Now comes the trickiest part of car purchases; getting everyone to agree. This time it was Dad who had his mind filled with concerns about Skoda's Service experience as his colleague who owned a Skoda Rapid, did not have a pleasant experience. After some persuasion and showing the Twitter handle of the then Director Mr. Zac Hollis, I succeeded in convincing him and my stomach had butterflies flying. On September 29th, 2021, I visited the dealership with my mother, and she absolutely loved the car, which made it pretty obvious that it is the Kushaq Style 1.0 TSI AT 6 Airbags was coming home, then the SA asked which color, and after some discussions, we finalized Carbon Steel. however, none of us had seen a Kushaq in Carbon Steel which was really annoying and the dealership did not have any Carbon Steel Color in the stockyard as it was among the fast-moving colors. We were really adamant about the color, it had to be Carbon Steel. Now the waiting time started, after every 3 days, I used to call the dealership in hope that there would be some news from their side, but efforts went down the drain as Skoda had not officially started the production of 6 airbag variants, which was quite annoying in reality. On the evening of 8th October, I received a call from my SA saying that they have a 1.5 DSG in Carbon Steel which was canceled and could be allotted to me if I act fast, I immediately asked him to forward me the proposal for the same stating that I will need at least 1-2 days time to confirm the same, which he happily accepted The biggest problem was the 1.5 DSG manufacturing of September 21 had 2 airbags as opposed to 6 airbags which we wanted, I guess the odds were in my favor, a video of Kushaq crashing in Gujarat floated on my youtube, and after watching that video I came to a conclusion that the Car has a strong build quality, and 6 airbags will just increase some amount of passive safety and I decided to gamble on the 2 airbag variant. The proposal was a very lucrative offer. Ex-showroom discount 30,000 K insurance discount of 20,000 K Corporate discount of 5K and an additional discount of 4,122. Got the accessories for free (apart from the tyre inflator) Extended Warranty which was 29K I selected the enhanced SMP which includes Brakes in addition to whatever is offered on the basic plan The OTR was about 20.3 Lac including the SMP and EW excluding 1% TCS The OTR for the 1.0 TSI AT (6 airbags) was somewhere near 19.4 Lac including SMP and EW. excluding 1% TCS So, all in all, I was offered a deal which was very hard to refuse to see the pros, especially the better engine option which could be mine. Spoke to Dad and he said go ahead if it's what your heart says and seeing a discount of almost 1 lakh on the 1.5 variant I really did not want to miss this deal. The real Irony at that time was I had not seen a Kushaq in Carbon Steel and I had not driven the 1.5 DSG even once, only knowing about the engine through videos and reviews. the First drive in 1.5 TSI was when I went to PDI and then pay the final amount before delivery. Took the delivery on 15th October 2021 on the auspicious day of Dussehra. Moderators, please move the thread to the correct subforum.

Many Kushaq/Taigun owners have reported multiple issues. Have you faced any issues with your car, like: - AC not cooling enough - EPC problems - Any other software or hardware issues? Thanks! Let me address each point. - AC not cooling enough I kind of agree with this point. My six-year-old Figo Aspire's AC compressor was way more powerful than Kushaq's. Kushaq takes a bit more time to cool the cabin if it is parked under direct sunlight. Automatic AC basically increases the fan speed which I hate in any car (I want the music sound or no sound at all inside the cabin ). So when starting from direct sunlight, I tend to opt for the manual mode to stabilize the temperature faster, then switch back to automatic AC after 10-15 minutes. - EPC problems No, never. Also, I never filled XP95 fuel. Always running on normal petrol from day 1. - Any other software or hardware issues? Nothing in particular. I have seen some people complaining about Apple carplay disconnecting automatically from time to time. but never happened to me. It is working (wireless) flawlessly from day 1. The small annoying thing is Apple carplay has limited features for example you won't get call logs inside the small screen in the instruments cluster while using Apple carplay, but Android auto got this feature (though I don't think Skoda is the culprit here, It must be Apple). Answering phone calls using the steering mount controls only works 100% time if the small screen is set to ""Phone"" view, but on other screens, sometimes it works sometimes it won't. Speaking of hardware issues, I would say the wiper blades are poor. Absolutely poor that I haven't seen anything low quality as this in my life.

Alejandro Furas, Secretary General of Global NCAP, said that both the models were voluntarily offered by their makers for testing. The two SUVs are the first to be tested under the new GNCAP protocols that also tests for side impact protection and requires ESC as standard. Quote: Frontal impact: the protection offered to the driver’s and passenger’s head and neck was good. Driver’s chest showed adequate protection and passenger’s chest showed good protection. Driver’s and passenger’s knees showed good protection. Driver’s tibias showed marginal and adequate protection and passenger’s tibias showed good protrection. Footwell area was rated as stable. The bodyshell was rated as stable and it is capable of withstanding further loadings. Side impact: head, abdomen and pelvis protection was good while chest protection was marginal. Side pole impact: curtain airbags meet the fitment requirements and pole impact test was performed in a version with side head protection airbags showing good protection to the head and pelvis, adequate protection to the abdomen and marginal protection to the chest. ESC: meets the fitment rate requirements and the performance shown in the test was acceptable according to Global NCAP’s latest requirements Quote: Frontal impact: the child seat for the 3 year old was installed rearward facing using the i-Size anchorages and a support leg and it was able to prevent head exposure during the frontal impact offering full protection. The child seat for the 18 month old was installed rearward facing using the i-Size anchorages and a support leg and it was able to prevent head exposure during the frontal impact offering full protection. Side impact: both CRS’s offered full side impact protection. The car offers 3 point belts in all seating positions as standard in all versions. It does not offer the possibility to disconnect the passenger airbag in case a rearward facing CRS will be installed in this position.

Things like the passenger shell, body in white cannot be re-engineered from the MQB platform. That is because they will not be able to justify the development costs v/s volumes. Maruti/Hyundai and the likes can do that with their larger volumes The same car is built for the export markets as well. So they should keep the differences minimal between local product and export product to keep their supply chain effiicient So the cost savings which might come as a result of some compromise in sheet metal might not be much The same car would be graded for the LATAM markets as well.

That doesn't cost as much as the diesel gate scandal or the lessons every car company learned out of it, with respect to technical compliance. I'm sure no global company will have the guts to repeat something like this. There is no way you can create a special body shell which can score high numbers in crash tests and do away with higher ratings while the production units will be different. And it's not just one or two additional structural members which can bump up a 0 star car into 5. In fact Tata did that exactly to score one extra star for the Nexon by adding reinforcement to the driver footwell. But for a global company like VW, the diesel gate has been enough. It is not something like adding a roll cage in a rally car. Due to the same complexity itself such companies don't water down the structure itself for local adaptations compared to their global models.

It passed the checklist with flying colors, except for a couple of things: 1) Using the VIN Decoder, i figured the car was manufactured in Jun 2022, but the sticker on the car wrote May 2022, is this a point of concern? 2) The front passenger door was squeaking a bit, which the the SA said was because the car was just washed? does that reason make sense? If yes, why only the FL door? 3) A metal rubbing noise when suddenly braking at crawling speeds. No such noise when slowing the car to stop when driving at normal speeds. Reason given was that the brakes are new and this would go away once they were settled in, but IMO it felt like this was suspension noise. 4)After the TD, was checking the engine bay and pavement for any leaks when noticed a little bit of water dripping down from about the middle of the vehicle. SA told that this was water from the AC unit. Other than that there were no dings, dents, ripples, or scratches. The car drives like a beauty and there was no rattling from inside that car.

For further clarity on the matter as to what constitutes a voluntary test - (*) Tested in compliance with the requirements of Global NCAPs voluntary test procedure. Manufacturer reaches out to Global NCAP with a request to submit a model for voluntary testing. Global NCAP selects the vehicle for testing. If the model is already in the market, the vehicle is sourced anonymously from a random dealership. If the model is pre launch but in production, Global NCAP makes an independent selection from production vehicles at the plant (not accepting any special series). Vehicles are sealed and transported to an accredited crash test laboratory. Global NCAP informs the manufacturer of relevant VIN numbers selected and invites representatives to observe testing. Crash tests are performed and a detailed technical inspection completed. Global NCAP shares the test report with the manufacturer. A one to one meeting is held with the manufacturer to inform them of the results. Results are published through Global NCAPs communication channels. After publication, Global NCAP invoices the manufacturer for all relevant testing costs. Global NCAP retains the right to audit any of the voluntary models tested.

I seek your valuable inputs in finalising my new car. Background: Presently I am driving i20 (2010, top model) with 85,000 kms on the odo. Planning to upgrade soon (3-4 months waiting wont hurt though). Requirements:  Budget- 16 lakh  The car would be the primary car and shall be retained for at least 10 years.  Most of the driving is going to be in the city (30-40 km in Chandigarh with speed limit of 60) and occasional highway drives (500 km in a month) mostly with the family (wife and a toddler). So, although I am an enthusiastic driver, barring once in a two-month highway drive with friends, enthusiastic driving will probably take a back seat and shall be replaced with sedate & mature driving.  Road presence is an important consideration.  Safety is a non-negotiable.  Automatic will be preferred since wife will also be driving (though only on weekend trips)  Diesel is not the first choice in view of the ban in Delhi and future uncertainty that comes along with it.  Cabin ambience should be appealing. However, lack of gizmos, bells and whistles is not a deal breaker. Options under consideration (not necessarily in the order of priority):  Kushaq 1.0 Ambition AT  Grand Vitara Delta AT  Hyryder S AT  Xuv 700 MX Diesel MT  Seltos HTK+ (facelift is also expected early next year) Thanks!", 17th October 2022,skoda-kushaq,Mohali,4,3,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

So far I have covered 1000km mainly city driving with a bit of highway and here are highlights of my experience so far.. What I like 1. Smoothness: everything is so smooth in driving as soon as you hold the steering and press the accelerator, you feel it, the clutch, the suspension and overall driving experience is amazingly smooth.. yes I am impressed by it, may be due to the fact that I have been moving in Duster for 3years.. 2. Looks: it looks very sharp and slick to me.. there is a contrast to bold and boxy looking SUVs like Creta which is fresh and pleasing. 3. The linear power delivery of 1.5tdi is so reassuring both in bumper to bumper traffic and when you are overtaking on highways. 4. Solid built and reassuring safety 5. Rear seats have plenty of leg room and overall car feels spacious. 6. Boot is very practical What is lacking 1. The pricing is very high..If you compare with what others are offering in the same segment. 2. Suspension feels too soft.. not meant for any amount of offloading. 3. The clutch is also very long and needs getting used to 4. Poor ergonomics : almost impossible not to touch AC button while changing gears..Same with seat belt slot and box lid. 5.

2908, sid__kaps , 12:19 ,BHPian,"Good afternoon everyone. I am not entirely sure as to where to post this, but I believe this is a start. My family and I are looking to purchase a new secondary vehicle at a price point of under 18 lakhs, to replace our i20 which is has started its journey into the 9th year. The vehicle has been very reliable and has served us very well. Our primary vehicle is a Toyota Fortuner (2017). Now here is the conundrum, prior to the Fortuner, we owned a Skoda Superb TSI MT, and our experience with that vehicle was beyond awful. The car proved to be a liability, with several breakdowns, and in the then-typical Skoda fashion, heavy costs to have it repaired. It reached a point that my father, decided to stay away from the German/Czech vehicles because of the awful experience we had. Now, while purchasing a new second car, we don't seem to be able to find our money's worth with the cars we have seen. No vehicle seems to have the fit and finish that of the Taigun and Kushaq. This is why I come here to ask: 1) Have the service and maintenance of Skoda improved over time? 2) Is there a longer service warranty that I can purchase, to cover major wear and tear? 3) For those owners, who have had the Kushaq for a while now, how is it doing for you, and in terms of servicing, what has been your experience?

Yes I have experienced it myself in my 10 yr old Polo that the costs have reduced. Also with child parts availability now in new platform cars this would add to reduction in cost. Regular service costs are between 6-7k per year if we take the SVP for 4 years at 25k. 2. All VAG cars get 4 years standard warranty now and we can purchase 2 years extended at 29k, so warranty coverage lasts for 6 years from the date of purchase. 3. We bought a Kushaq this year for our father and have had no issues so far, car has travelled 7000+ kms now. Initial batches had rattling problems which have now been fixed it seems, our car did rattle and it was fixed after a 1 hour visit to service centre. The new platform MQB A0 IN recently received a 5 star safety rating from GNCAP with the updated norms so that gives the VAG twins a new USP apart from the driving and performance.", 29th October 2022,skoda-kushaq,"UP32,HR26,MH12",279,941,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

It is going to be the first car to be bought out of own funds and I am really excited about it. I am planning to get the delivery tomorrow. Have already completed the PDI (as per team BHP checklist) and everything looked good. I have a few doubts and would like to get your valuable inputs on the following: i. Should I purchase the extended warranty? And if yes, should it be purchased right away or can be done before expiry of the existing warranty? The sales guy told me if I purchase it afterwards, the price will increase but he couldnt clarify the quantum of price increase. ii. I am being offered an accessory kit costing Rs. 7999/- which includes mud flaps, rubber mats, car cover, perfume and a refill, rear sun shades, two cushions, a starter kit (which includes small packs of car cleaning products) and c to usb converter. Since all the items dont seem useful to me, I would like to get some of the items replaced with other useful accessories. I am ready to pay the differential amount, if any. Has anybody had success in getting the items in the default accessory kit replaced? iii. Should I get the seat covers installed from the dealership or get it done aftermarket?

2929, Pappukanghi , 21:35 ,Newbie,"Hi Folks I've been contemplating buying the Style 1.0 AT for several weeks. I was concerned by the user reports on insufficient cooling of the AC so I paid special attention to this during my test drives. Sadly in all of the TDs, I found the cooling to be insufficient - I did 3 TD with different cars to rule out any anomaly. Even after overriding the auto setting, and keeping the fan and temperature at its max setting, the cooling barely reached a ""comfortable"" level in all the instances. The passengers on the rear seat found it even more insufficient. The drives lasted 15-20min to allow sufficient time for the cabin to cool down. Surprisingly, none of the 2 dealers I did the TD had received any complaints regarding the AC, they were not even aware of the software patch that has been discussed on this forum previously. I also spoke to a couple of friends who have bought the 1.0 AT Kushaq and Taigun, and they found the cooling to be satisfactory in the Mumbai weather. I'd request the recent owners of the 1.0 AT to please help with the following: 1) How has been your experience with the AC cooling, specially in hot humid weather and with passengers in the rear seat. 2) Does the cooling improve over time or at a certain speed/rpm? 3) Is the software upgrade being rolled out only in select cities and dealers? How are some dealers not aware that this exists? This concern is making me hold back my decision of buying this otherwise spectacular car.

That is because, when torque demand (A-pedal position, gear engaged, rpm, wheelspeed -> these measurements are used to figure out how much torque is demanded by the driver right now) is super high, the A/C compressor is forcefully shut off (clutch disengaged or blade angle set to benign no compression , depending on the type of A/C compressor) by the engine ECU. This supercedes what the climate control computer is trying to do with the compressor.

Thanks neochanger for your valuable inputs. 1 I already got a pretty good bargain at the time of booking. I thought that getting a reduction in price was a better option than getting extended warranty for free. Plus I was not sure whether I needed it. 2. I tried but didn't insist on it. As I had got a good bargain on the price, the sales guy requested me to purchase the kit. Hence, ended up buying the kit. 3. The sales guy gave a negative feedback about the accessories guys and suggested to get the covers aftermarket. I also found their work below par as the chrome finish I opted for was not properly installed. So, as suggested by you, will go for aftermarket seat covers in a couple of weeks.

I am also planning to get the seat covers installed aftermarket in a couple of weeks. Hi everyone, Happy to share that I am now a proud owner of Kushaq 1.0 AT (candy white). Enough has already been told about the driving experience on this forum. The car makes you fall in love with it pretty soon. Put your hands on that two spoke steering wheel, turn on your favourite song, gently press the accelerator and I bet the minimalist yet classic cabin (especially at night) will make you forget all your worries. Coming from a 12 year old i20, the upgrade feels worth every penny. Apart from the drive, some of the not-so-talked-about but useful features I liked about the car: i. Speed limit beeps: Yes, there are mandatory beeps at speed of 80 km/hr and 120 km/hr. However, there is an option of setting an additional beep at user defined speed limit. Although the beeps might annoy some, however the function is really useful for driving in cities like Chandigarh where the speed limit of 60 km/hr is strictly enforced. ii. Cornering lights: The function seems really helpful in dark/ poorly lit roads/ corners. I am sure that the function will come really handy while driving in the hills. iii. Tyre pressure monitoring: Although the Ambition classic variant does not have TPMS, but I noticed that there is an option of setting a warning when the tyre pressure drops from the defined level. Although, I am not sure how itll work and whether tyre specific warning will come when pressure drops. iv. Central locking: The doors wont open when central locking is activated. However, pulling the door handle twice deactivates the central locking. Shall share more such features as and when I discover them. However, I have also noticed some of the issues as below: i. The blower intermittently makes loud sound as if the fan speed has increased, though it remains same. ii. The reverse camera takes some time to disappear after the gear shift. At times, it does not switch off and has to be done manually. Hs anybody else faced the above issues and found the solution? iii. When seen very minutely from a certain angle under light, micro scratches/ swirl marks are visible especially on the bonnet. Is it a cause of concern or I am being too much obsessed with the new car? And whether I should go for any kind of paint protection? iv. Lastly, I have read that tiny bits of piano finish in the interior gets scratches quite fast. Has anybody opted for any protection for such areas inside the cabin?

2942, pravs3012 , 22:56 ,BHPian,"Dear BHPians - after the initial introduction this is my first post. I have tried best to follow the guidelines but please feel free to suggest anything for future. The moderators are requested to edit as per the rules. Here we go: Vehicle: Kushaq MT 1.5 - Style . Booking and delivery: August '2022 Distance covered till date: 1500 KMS Likes : 1. Engine : 1.5 MT  just awesome. The power-torque combination is confidence inspiring. I consider myself a conservative driver but I know the car can provide the necessary shift when needed. 2. Sitting comfort: 4 adults are treated with absolute luxury. 3. Driving position: I am 6 ft with lean frame, and this suits me well. 4. Size: A LIKE for me but may not be for others  I am not worried about road presence. 5. Visibility  big difference coming from Polo. 6. Cabin sound : Good handling but I feel this is yet to be tested . 7. Boot space : may be smaller in numbers but well designed and definitely good for our usage 8. Exterior  subjective but my family loves it. 9. Skoda smart features  make the spacing of different pockets / charging points very usable 10. SAFETY Rating : This is more of a relief than happiness as safety was one of the primary reasons we booked Skoda (or VW) and hence anything less might have left a bad taste in the mouth. Not so likes : 1. Any family with regular usage for 4+ adults : 5th passenger is not so welcome unless a kid or for short distance. 2. Positioning of AC controls : I feel I need to focus away for a moment. On the other hand, steering controls take some time to used to but then help specially 3. AC cooling : can be termed average. Takes time to cool and the sound is bit more for my comfort. Bangalore weather last 2 months means I never had to keep it at higher level and that helped. 4. Cabin size : Subjective but a driver with bigger frame/physique may find the cabin slightly smaller for comfort. Given the segment, someone may want to compare the others for exact dimensions. 5. Average interiors : Wish they were better designed. 6. Tires : I have the manufacturer given CEAT ones but I am sure people would want to go for better variants. 7. A feeling of lottery : you may get 10 inch or 8 inch display no matter the cost you are paying. 8. I am not a music savvy person but so far felt this is not the league of what Seltos had (BOSE of course) 9. Wipers  average. 10. A constant feeling  why 20 lakhs given some average stuff inside (listed above) Booking experience Our first car was Polo highline Petrol which I drove from 2014. An absolute beauty in looks and driving, it was perfect for a family of 3 and occasional 5-member drive. I actually learned driving in that. Barring initial scratches /dents  maintained it very close to heart. Followed all the service routines and ensured insurance is used perfectly to clear off any hatred signs. We drove 67k and was a very tough decision to let it go. The primary reasons being rear seat spacing and my legs starting to complain of the seating position  age catching up perhaps? . I can go on and write more but I would summarize by one line  the moment it was driven away I kept looking at it till I could and that took me back to 2014 when I had to let my kid enter day care gate and I would watch him till I could. Not to drown you into emotional well, let me jump to the second part. Criteria of change: 1. Safety (fact it got 5 stars only helped feel better of the decision). 2. Driving pleasure with seating comfort for a family of 3/4. We have an automated Kwid for city commute. It does its job quite well. 3. Ground Clearance 4. Budget not exceeding 20 L. 5. Engine capacity  wanted more than what Polo offered. Next steps: Test drives and booking I shortlisted 4 cars in the preference order  Jeep, Taigun, Kushaq and Seltos. First one remained etched to the heart, but I cancelled the test drive simply because I did not want my heart to decide the budget. Loved both Taigun and Kushaq in driving sense. Found Kushaq better in looks but Taigun in its interiors. Seltos was fun to drive, amazing features, cabin was nothing short of a gadget gallery. The sales team was very smart and responsive. Why I decided against  not very sure as it was a tough decision but somewhere deep in heart VWs experience played its role. The story then on is a perfect example of sales team helping you make a decision and Skoda SA just latched on the opportunity while Taigun guys simply did not care at all. This should not mean anything in generic and might be simply an individual experience. I had decided to exchange Polo via dealer and here again Skoda guys were very aggressive while VW team was as laid back. I felt as if the destiny is moving us toward Kushaq and same day we were driven to PPS motors, Jakkur- Bangalore. My decision to go for 1.5 MT was clear from day one though it was challenged multiple times mainly to go for DSG by wife and dealer. I had heard about improvements but wanted to still skip the potential DSG issues in future. I wanted honey orange, but wife and son clearly zeroed in the Red (Tornado) and I was vetoed. As I would be the driving the car, color had to as per family. Booking process was straightforward. The delivery time was 2 weeks. The SA kept me in loop all the time. He was fine for a PDI and shared details if I would like to go for it. Given the experience with him all this while and him sharing every detail and answering all the queries about vehicle like OVRM, VIN, tires, I decided to skip that and trust the instincts. And finally the date arrived  took a gift for SA and completed remaining formalities. There was a slight confusion regarding the payment of SMP. I was under the (wrong) impression that by removing it from the cost breakup, dealer is paying but it meant I would pay at the time of delivery if I wanted it. Special shout out to Vaibhav from PPS Jakkur. He was very courteous and prompt throughout the process. He deserves a lot of credit for me going with Kushaq when comparing with Taigun. The details are (booked in August22) : Ex-showroom: 17,19,000 Road Tax: 3,27,038 Loyalty bonus for Polo (-20k) Insurance: Drive Assure: 55k (went with dealer) Final Price = almost 21 lakhs including 25k for 4 years maintenance package and 30 for 5th and 6th year warranty. Just to mention we had also used HDFC Regalia to get a 25k discount. I did not go for any PPF or any other accessory. Hindsight tells me I should have gone with different tires but that is left for the future now as the budget seemed stretched by that time. Experience so far: 1. Took some time to adjust to the difference in engine power, torque and mainly the clutch/gear. I had to be careful taking it out of basement as the car would move faster than I was used to. Engine is peppy and no speed actually feels like the number due to smooth handling of variety of roads. 2. Suspension is good, if not great. Some potholes ( not rare here) were felt but usually the suspension and GC helps. 3. The driving is fun and so far during the only highway drive to Pondicherry , enjoyed it without doubt. The car beeps every time you cross 80 and continuously above 120. I dont prefer driving above 100 no matter which highway but my son wanted to hear the continuous beeping once and the car duly obliged but that was enough not to try again. 4. Coming from 3 -spoke polo, the 2 spoke Steering took some time to adjust. It is slightly lighter to my liking but confidence inspiring. 5. The steering controls need some training but once we understand are easy to maneuver. 6. Love the seating posture which has not given me any complain in 3 months. 7. Barring the first time, I have been using Shell OR XP95 on Indian Oil. I am yet to experience a change if I use something else. 8. I feel going for better tires would have been a good decision but I was sure not to spend a penny more. 9. A couple of times experienced a feeble shrieking sound while reversing  will wait and watch and decide after that. 10. Reverse camera works every time, but the lines are not too sharp. 11. Wireless charging worked 8/10 times. 12. Finally - I cannot be tired driving this vehicle. Happiness is the word I would associate with the experience so far. I am not a knowledgeable person who can pin-point the technicality and this decision was driven more from heart than mind. Future will tell from after-sales perspective.

Infact, there are quite a few differences like the seating position, the height of the dashboard, etc. coming from Asian manufacturers (mainly Honda, Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai).

Once you book the vehicle and it arrives at dealers yard then they call you for Pre Delivery Inspection.

So now if any fault is observed there is nothing cant be done except for repair. I learned it hard way at the time of my car delivery , everything was good except for couple things, odo reading was 96km and vehicle build was 4 months older than delivery date, but nothing cant be done then. Dealership performs PDI before car delivery from their side so there are less chances you will observe anything. Except for Team BHP PDI check list check for a few extra things : 1. Exterior : fuel lid should open/close properly(this was a problem in 2021 Kushaqs). Open and close it multiple times. 2. Interior: Turn on the vehicle observe any unusual Noise or Vibrations. Observe Central console armrest panel for vibrations, Observe it from rear seat. It vibrates a lot if not fitted properly.

Car has an automatic engine ON/OFF system. I always disable it as it switches off on almost every signal within 10 -15 seconds. This needs to be disabled every time you start the car. Even if the car stalls, starting is one clutch away. 3. The ECO mode - Kushaq running on 2 cylinders rather than 4 - is very seamless and I notice it multiple times whenever the car is strolling at a fixed speed for few seconds. 4. The fuel efficiency: (a) City: 10-11 in peak traffic but elsewhere I get 12-13. (b) Only one trip but I got 16.3 from Bangalore to Pondicherry. Little less while returning but that was partly due to slow driving owing to weather and timing. 5. I should read about the exact acceptable deviations, but I had enabled the Tire Pressure detection. I filled 34 but did not get any sensor when the pressure was down to 30. Perhaps this is needs to be set every time - weird if so?

2952, _Piyush_ , 18:50 ,BHPian,"Greetings fellow BHpians, Due to ongoing exams and other personal work, I was not getting the time to write a thread. The Odometer was at 25309 Km on 15th October 2022. Installed the Sporty Pedals of Monte Carlo for 549 from Zedex Skoda, Sahibabad. Got Graphene 9H coating done from Ekaa Detailing Hub, Indirapuram. Will update you on the same in a later thread with pictures attached. I was quoted 18K for the coating for one car. As I and my friends decided to go for the ceramic coating almost at the same time, it allowed us to get a very good bargain. A discount of INR 4500 per car. Likes and Dislikes post one year of ownership are mentioned here: 1. The engine performance and the driving dynamics are the same as they were on day 1 2. The Paint quality is just amazing in comparison to other cars in the same segment. No dullness in the factory paint. 3. The DSG has adapted to my driving behavior and tends to hold the gears for a while near 1850 RPM before upshifting. 4. The newly built expressway and national highways just make it feel that the car is finally being driven where it was meant to be. 5. Overtaking is a breeze, no downshifts or upshifts are required. 6. The FE (what we Indians Love), the FE purely depends on how the car is driven and what kind of throttle inputs have been used. I generally get 13.5 - 14.1 (tank to tank) in 70:30 city: highway usage with AC on, with the AC off the mileage increases by 0.5-0.7. On pure highway usage, the FE never goes under 18KMPL. The ACT helps in increasing the FE of this fuel thirsty 1.5 TSI 7. The Touchscreen response is by far the best I have used. 8. Being a 2021 model, it came with the 340 watts Skoda Sound System, which I would not say is the best in the segment but is decent enough for the dimension which Kushaq has. One thing which I have noticed is the sound increases exponentially once you cross the volume of 15 and at 20, the whole car is dancing with the bass. 9. The double pull to unlock never fails to amaze anyone who sits in the car and most of my friends say ""yaar yeh feature sab gaadi mai hona chaiye"". How this works is on the first pull, the doors get unlocked and on the second pull, the door opens. (NOTE: the driver door would unlock and open on the first pull itself.) 10. Noise rarely finds its way into the cabin, and if it does it is more wind noise and some minor squeaks of the dashboard trim. 11. Using 95 Octane has resulted in better performance and fuel efficiency. 12. Service has improved in comparison to before but it still needs significant improvement in comparison to Hyundai, Honda, and Toyota. 13. The sound of the engine and the Turbo post 2500+ rpm is soothing to the ears. 14. LED headlamps have a good throw, however, I feel that they are a bit more angled in the left direction. I know it is to avoid HighBeam glaring at the oncoming traffic but I feel a bit more center-oriented light would work like a charm. 1. The odd 205/55 R 17 sized tyre is one of the biggest dislikes I have. Michelin does not make tyres of that size and changing the tyres to a different dimension would void the suspension and associated components warranty. 2. Why can't a car costing upwards of 20Lac not come with led foglamps? Even bigger trouble, the headlamp, and the foglamp are one single unit, if by any chance you crack the glass of the headlamp or foglamp it is the complete unit that will have to be replaced, The price on boodmo for one headlight is INR 25K. 3. lack of a digital driver's display in the car feels annoying at times but the analog cluster gives a good old-school vibe. 4. No electric adjustment available. 5. The one-touch auto window is a hit or miss (already replaced once under warranty) 6. DSG DQ200 is jerky in lower gears and tends to engage D1 on bad patches of road. 7. The rear seats cannot accommodate three adults comfortably. 8. There should have been some hood insulation to reduce the noise level a bit. 9. The window motors are noisy. 10. AC performance is just okay, have not gotten any software updates done, and did not feel the need as well. Note (I found the controls and the performance in manual mode is better in comparison to auto) above mentioned are my likes and dislikes based on one year of ownership Issues faced: 1. One-touch window motor replaced under warranty. 2. Contacts fail to sync over AA and Bluetooth 3. in August this year, my parents were on their way to Mathura and somewhere near Jewar I received an alert stating SKODA diagnosed a Fault, the Error code was P0440 which was EVAP failure. (reason for this was the monsoon season and some amount of moisture entering the Fuel tank during the fillup) The current Odometer reading is at 27387 KM Will post updates after the Second service due at 30,000 Km.

I believe Skoda Myconnect app is just reskinned Jio motive app. If you have used both, it would have been identical. It is most likely developed by Jio and free of cost to Skoda if they have purchased with a certain MOQ of dongle from them. Now the contract wouldn't have been renewed and new provider is Airtel but they can't update the app. So they would have ended up with new app. Hope this time it is developed in house.

Recently faced a strange issue related to Kushaq. Being from the automobile industry let me tell you something, apart from the body of the car nothing is manufactured by the manufacturer, everything comes from the supplier, you may think that the car is only 6 or 3 or 1 month old based on the VIN, but that is just a data printed by the manufacturer. All the parts and components inside the car are from the suppliers, some local, some imported, which are being manufactured well in advance in time. You don't even know the dates of their manufacturing. And cars when cared for last for 10-15 years easily. It's not like 3 month or a 6 month old car is not gonna last. You are right about cars being manufactured in advance, due to part shortage cars were manufactured in advance without electronic components, and when the parts get available, the cars are finished, tested again and dispatched to dealers. All the manufacturers follow these practices. Production is planned well in advance, so due to part shortage these things happen. I would suggest don't worry too much about it, you have 4 years of standard warranty, plus you can get 2 years of extended warranty. You can do PDI before payment too.

In fact, my biggest worry is not about how the chassis was stored for more than 6 months at the factory, instead it's about carrying over the initial niggles associated with the vehicle i.e., door/bonnet noise, window motor issues, EPC error, etc. Knowing about the manufacturing status while paying upward of 21 lakhs makes it really difficult .

3023, neeravnaik , 15:57 ,BHPian,"I booked the Skoda Kushaq 1.5 L DSG Style White with PPS Skoda Mysore Road. Current Garage: BMW 320 D F30 (2016) Sportline Red - 75K kms. Honda Brio V AT (2012) Silver - 60K kms. Since we shifted to the outskirts Brio usage has decreased as it feels inadequate for daily use on Highways and Expressways. Lack of Safety and Power are major reasons for the upgrade. Currently BMW is used as daily driver which gives great mileage and is also very comfortable and can take most bad roads and traffic easily. Since BMW is now out of warranty we wanted to use it less in city traffic and bad roads so we can use it easily for years to come. Preferred body type was SUV though Budget was flexible 20lakh CSUV segment was the sweet spot being easier to drive around the town while being adequate for longer trips. Higher segment also considered if it felt like a sufficient upgrade. Both me and my wife will be driving it. Options considered Hyundai Creta: Feels nice sized with good space and features and would have probably gone for Diesel AT. Driving dynamics and performance was decent not great compared to the Germans. Feature loaded but it did not matter greatly in the choice. Looks did not appeal and somehow they seem to be making the car uglier with each iteration. Test car had not age well with the Parking hold switch broken and seats etc. all frayed. Safety also a factor to reject it. Hyundai Tucson: Definitely more refined and plush with quite a lot of features which are more good to have. Size just felt bigger than needed when moving around the city. Value definitely a factor Toyota Hyryder: Impressed with the smooth driving hybrid. Great choice if comfort and not performance is your primary concern. Big deal breaker was the boot size for such a large car. The flimsy sun roof undercover is also unacceptable. Overall while seats etc felt nice but overall build etc. felt like a Maruti and car does not feel that solid. XUV 700: Great product but this was an academic choice due to waiting times. Almost a complete choice with great build, interiors and good performance on both fuel options. Diesel Engine/gearbox combination is very good but Waiting times for car size bigger than needed made it easier to reject. Some parts like door handles feel cheap but overall great value product. Citroen C5: Nice ride and upgrade looks great. However seats felt bit narrow for the driver. Backseats are also narrow in effort to make it true 5 seater. For the price again was never seriously considered Jeep Compass: We seriously considered the Diesel variant. Interiors are probably one of the best in the segment and feel very premium. It is also great to drive over all types of road surfaces. Seating position is nice and feels like a complete product till you start driving it. Somehow the Engine and gearbox combination feels not up to it. Engine is too noisy and gearbox is laggy. Difference in driving it back to back with 320d is too stark. Gearbox which feels even 20% lazier would really add up a lot when you have to drive it everyday. I feel for this price it should be effortless driving when many others like XUV 700 have managed to get it right. SKoda Kushaq: Both of us had arrived at our choices pretty early in the process. It really feels powerful and fun to drive. Driving is effortless and the nimble size and driving dynamics makes it a fun experience taking it around town or on highways. This was the primary criteria for both of us and no one else came close to it. 1.5 L was the clear choice as 1L driven back to back felt just a bit slower to respond. I am realistic about potential DSG troubles and will budget for it and as long as it does not leave us stranded badly I am ok. Extended warranty has been taken. Decent interiors and seating comfort. Kushaq out scores Taigun in terms of interior and we also preferred its exterior looks. Great knee room for people in the backseat and boot also is adequate though not generous. Features have been comprised and you wish they would give a proper TPMS and electric seat adjustment. Good to see a manual handbrake though. Infotainment etc. is also ok and livable and not very exciting. Finally for us at this price I am happy to pay for a better core product and live with acceptable add ons.

Even without the memory seat this would have worked if the door had a dedicated control unit.

3035, worldlife83 , 09:18 ,Newbie,"So a new issue has popped up in Skoda Kushaq and this time this is an equally severe issue like EPC failure as this is related to brake failure. I have purchased Kushaq Ambition AT 1.0 on June 3rd from Garve Skoda Pune, and the car started to cause problems within 500kms for running. Brakes of the car gets suddenly jammed while running and don't get release so the car comes to a sudden stop. This happened 1st when car running was just under 500km, skoda service centre kept the car for few hours and told me that it was due to some brake switch. Then same issue happened after running the car for 100 more kms, I was with my family, it happened at 9:30pm and for 30mins I tried to connect with RSA but it was busy, tried calling sales advisor, he made a couple of calls but in the end told me that he is not able to help at this time and will connect with me in morning, and all this was happening in Pune city, not sure what would be the scenario where there are no skoda service centres. After waiting for almost an hour, suddenly car brakes got released and I was able to drive the car back to home while. This time they took it a bit more seriously as I escalated the matter and told me that this will get diagnosed by their technical team. Technical team came up with the reason that it is due to faulty master cylinder and same was replaced and old part was sent to their research team to identify what was the issue. I was ensured that they will share a complete detail of research outcome but looks like it was just a gimmick as no one came back to me with any thing on that issue even after 4 months. In next 4 months I drove car for around 3k kms and although the irritating brake noise was continuously there which Skoda has conveniently started to called as operational issue, but apart from irritating brake noise in bumper to bumper traffic and on slopes I don't face any other issue. Suddenly the issue reappeared while I was going to drop my kid to school, again in the middle of road without any prior warning of signal of any issue. After keeping the car for 1 week, again they have came up with a solution that master cylinder and brake booster needs to be replaced along with the Master cylinder gasket. I don't understand how skoda can be so careless and diagnosing the issues and replacing the parts randomly just to get it tested by customers. How can a robust part like brake master cylinder and brake booster fail twice in 4000km of running, these are the parts which usually don't get replaced ever. This was my 1st and definitely last Skoda, I was one of the person who gave safety a priority although NCAP rating was not out at that time but still it felt more solid then the competition but it is true that safety rating won't help you if your car is ridden with such severe issues like brake failure. Now I am looking to sell this car asap and book a Toyota (hopefully hyryder will get a good safety rating). For new buyers, that's the only advice that its a fun to drive car but no amount of fun is worth if the car is not reliable, I made a mistake of putting my money in such an unreliable brand when this is my only car. We see issues in other cars and brands as well but just compare the number of units they sell in comparison to skoda to get those number of issues. Failure rate in skoda is just too high. One good gesture is that after 3rd failure they have immediately provided me loaner car to cary out my day to day duties but I have kept 3 cars in past and I never had to take a loaner car as my cars never went to service station apart from regular serivce.", 22nd December 2022,skoda-kushaq,PUNE,6,28,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Positive

It's no surprise that despite the fun-to-drive factor and robust safety, response to Skoda/VW cars manage to sell unenviable numbers thanks to reliability issues and the lack of urgency in addressing them. As a potential buyer, these episodes repose more trust on the more reliable, fuss-free brands we usually don't hesitate to brickbat on the grounds of performance and safety.

See be it any vehicle or any manufacturer, it's a mechanical vehicle with many components, and with these many components the chances of breakdown or failure increases too. Mahindra might be more reliable but BS6 diesel engines have DEF issues, many people have faced them. People take their luxury SUV's to remote places where there are no service centers, no people with repair knowledge and no support whatsoever, but people do drive them throughout the country. I have been driving my volkswagen polo in Rajasthan for the last 9 years where there are like 4-5 service centers in total. Have not faced any breakdowns, whereas you might find many breakdown cases of polo in our country online. If you're that concerned about reliability get a car with a simple engine and simple mechanicals, where chances of breakdown are less and can be repaired easily anywhere. Maruti Brezza has 4 star safety and a NA 1.5 engine, fits your criteria. Or if you want to enjoy driving your car everyday, and not that concerned about occasional breakdowns get a car which you like.

My dad bought a Willys when I was 3. But now my holiday car is an Ertiga bought in 2012, though it has done only 40000km and is very well maintained.

However as you rightly guessed Im looking for an SUV type to keep for the next 10 year (till Im 70 ) You see Ill be driving in the mountains to our home and also in the city. Thats why Id zeroed in on Kushaq 1.5 dsg. Dont want manual and the 1.0 would be underpowered Im told. Also didnt like the immense lag during the TD.

3054, abhinav1817 , 21:53 ,BHPian,"Hi Experts and Owners, I am in the wait of an SUV since some time now. I am an enthusiast and love to revv hard. Looking for an automatic. Live in Bangalore; Mostly City plus occasional highway trips. Now, as my overall KMs run is low, Diesel is ruled out. I am looking for Turbo Petrol and mostly will decide between Creta DCT, Seltos DCT, Kushaq 1.5 or Taigun 1.5. My research has been via mostly Teambhp and Youtube reviews/ownership reviews but also some friend's / family's personal feedbacks. The OTR for 1.5 DGG Style is ~25L OTR including extended warranty which is approx 3L more than what i want/desire, so had some question specific to Kushaq: 1. Space: We have a 2 year old daughter and we use Car seat at the back? I am given to understand we cannot / should not put the seat in middle, and once you have put the seat at one side, 2 adults cannot sit. My parents are retired so they usually come live with us and we do have the need for 2 adults at back on most occasions. Can some one please provide their experience or feedback on actual comfort? --> This is a primary concern of shortlisting Creta because there 3 adults could sit very comfortably. 2. Mileage - Although not a deal breaker, as even today i drive for pleasure and ""do not really"" worry about the FE. But will a DSG + Turbo be a disaster for FE if i am not careful about it?? 3. DSG gear box - have read and watched almost all articles, dos and donts, didnt find a single source of truth or a common pattern for failures/issues, so this is more of a generic question if this is a sure shot issue or case to case, considering I live in whitefield Bengaluru. (but can avoid school/office traffic, have flexibility in office timings) 4. Suspension - Again my research says that Kushaq is class leading in terms of bad road performance, much better than Seltos and Creta. Even better than Taigun. I hear Taigun and Virtus both have very hard suspension and bad roads can be tiring at the end of long driving trip. Can i get some real life experience here? (even from Creta owners, i might be wrong) I have booked a test drive; hopefully by this weekend should have more clarity myself but i doubt 20-25 mins can give a real picture and hence reaching out. As a driver, i am ok to let go Panoramic sunroof, but voters in the family are strong yes for that, so will not go there for now.

People are mentioning offers upto 1 lakh currently, do enquire at other dealers too. This is the best time to get discounts. Just ask them to give discount on ex showroom price. 1. My brother has a kushaq, a 2 year old kid and parents too. So what he does he make larger people sit in the front. In the back with the child seat on one side 2 people are able to sit. See it depends on the size of the people too, although creta/seltos might be a bit wider, but would you prefer a 5 star rated car for your family vs a barely 3 star car? 2. Coming to the fuel economy part, that too depends on traffic, city vs highway usage, your driving habits etc. But on highways people have reported good fuel economy. The 1.5 TSI even comes with ACT technology which shuts 2 cylinders under less load. You will get similar fuel economy in turbo petrols with the same power figures. But the ARAI rating of 1.5 TSI is higher than 1.0 TSI. 3. Kushaq is coming with 4 years of standard warranty, 2 years of extended warranty, and recently they have announced extended warranty for 7th and 8th year. With the launch of the India 2.0 cars they had announced changes to the DQ200 gearbox which made it more reliable and fit for our country. Recently we haven't been hearing DQ200 failure cases as well. There are some practices to preserve DSG gearbox like shifting to N in traffic too. 4. Well many people including GTO have praised the suspension of Kushaq a lot, having the perfect balance of Dynamics and comfort. German cars are known for this only.

This is a very hard problem to solve. You are not supposed to put the child seat in the front seat unless there is a provision to turn off front passenger airbag. Keeping the child seat in the middle of the backseat doesn't leave much space for two adults to sit comfortably on long journeys. Quote: 2. Mileage - Although not a deal breaker, as even today i drive for pleasure and ""do not really"" worry about the FE. But will a DSG + Turbo be a disaster for FE if i am not careful about it?? Good FE is one of the main reasons why lot of manufacturers are using dual clutch transmissions. If you drive sedately, you will get very good FE. If you drive aggressively, you will still get good FC compared to any other transmission including a manual when driven in the same manner. You can't be wishing to drive aggressively and blame poor FE on DCT. And yes, DSG does encourage sporty driving. This is a feature and not a bug, just as Hybrid/eCVT of Toyota encourages you to drive sedately. Quote: 3.

(but can avoid school/office traffic, have flexibility in office timings) DSG (dry type) is not a reliable transmission. Failure rates have come down but still very high when compared to TC/CVT transmissions. You most certainly have to protect yourself against a potential failure with extended warranty. VW group has a tendency to reject warranty claims for reasons the defy logic - though you should be fine if you don't do any aftermarket fitments including battery and stick to scheduled service.

3057, Livnletcarsliv , 09:53 ,BHPian,"Yesterday, I took an extended TD of Kushaq 1.5 DSG. The following are my observations, especially in comparison to my ex-2019 Harrier XZ. Positives 1. It is definitely a hoot to drive. The paddle shifters are a boon for enthusiasts. 2. The car is very agile and a great handler. Of course, Harrier is 1 size larger than Kushaq. 3. Even though the car is compact, there is more than enough space for 4+1. Of course, the rear legroom was less than Harrier but it was nothing short as well. I was able to sit comfortably (I am almost 6ft) at the rear with the driver seat set to my driving position. 4. It has almost all the bells and whistles one can expect in the market with very few exceptions like powered seats, etc. I did not check all/most of the features because I am not a gizmos person. 5. The ride was good enough, not exceptional though. However, it was still on the stiffer side as expected from a driver's car and Skoda. 6. The boot has good space management. It was good enough for a car of this size. 7. Upto 6 years/1.5L km warranty - one of the best in the industry. Even though sales the person mentioned that during the 6th year, based on the goodwill and customer relationship, the warranty can be extended to 8 years (additional 2 years). I still doubt how can the warranty be extended only to select customers based on the so-called goodwill. 8. The torque was as expected for a 1350 kg car. Personally, I felt underpowered purely because of the Harrier diesel effect. However, I don't have any complaints though. 9. The steering was so light and easy to maneuver, especially at slow speeds. The high-speed heft was as expected and good enough for an enthusiast. 10. Fit and finish were good enough. Not exceptional though. 11. NVH is well controlled. Negatives 1. There is a serious downgrade in terms of quality. In fact, the airflow control knob of the AC vents felt so cheap that it can be compared to a Rs. 200 toy car that we get at the festival exhibition. 2. The cost-cutting is so evident. Harrier was way better in terms of quality. The plastic felt so cheap in Kushaq. 3. Somehow I felt claustrophobic inside the cabin (Probably because of the Harrier effect). 4. Even though DSG did its job to the T, the initial pick-up/response from the standstill could have been better. I definitely felt a delay in response from a standstill. I am sure the manual will not have this issue. No, I am not talking about the turbo lag. 5. AC definitely needs an upgrade. The full HVAC system was screaming at the top of the roof to cool the cabin. The temperature was set at 18. Even then, I never felt colder for the entire 50min TD. This is not even summer. Just imagine how will it be in Chennai summers. 6. The weight/heft of the bonnet was not as expected (evident cost cutting). The weight of the bonnet feels like it is 50% lighter than that of Harrier's. Even the door-closing thud was way better in Harrier. Harrier was way more robust. 7. I am not a fan of touch AC control. 8. The sports mode is literally a joke. The only difference is that gear shift happens at a higher rpm increasing the torque availability for the appropriate rev range to feel like it pulls faster. In Harrier, all 3 modes (Eco, City, Sports) are significantly different from each other. There is a power difference between modes. Only in sports mode, you will be able to utilize the full 170ps in Harrier. 9. I somehow felt the driver's seat back small (Again Harrier effect). In Harrier, I was able to comfortably sit with my back fully cocooned by the seat. In Kushaq, I felt my back a little squeezed to fit in the seat. No problem for short drives. I wonder how comfortable will it be for the long drives. 10. Finally, the cost. It is expensive (23.5L ONR for Monte Carlo DSG - 2022 pricing) for what it offers. Regarding reliability, the salesperson says that for the past 2 years, the number of DQ200 complaints is significantly lesser than the old one. For this price, overall, I am unsatisfied with the Kushaq. This is not a true Skoda. Except for the driving thrill which includes handling and ride quality (which again is not exceptionally good compared to Harrier), this Skoda is a serious letdown in many departments like the quality of materials, build, and AC performance, etc. I might as well choose another Harrier.", 11th January 2023,skoda-kushaq,TN66/TN14,829,"2,075","Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

I own a Kushaq and I have a similar family (My wife, 7 year old son, 2 senior citizen in laws) joining for short and long drives. Once you keep the baby car seat on the rear left seat (my preference as it is on kerb side and non traffic facing), the middle and right rear passengers are a quite a bit of squeeze.

Thank you very much for that feedback. This helps a lot to get real life picture. I had read about the middle seat hump but can co-relate now.

Looking for an automatic. Live in Bangalore; Mostly City plus occasional highway trips. Now, as my overall KMs run is low, Diesel is ruled out. I am looking for Turbo Petrol and mostly will decide between Creta DCT, Seltos DCT, Kushaq 1.5 or Taigun 1.5. My research has been via mostly Teambhp and Youtube reviews/ownership reviews but also some friend's / family's personal feedbacks. The OTR for 1.5 DGG Style is ~25L OTR including extended warranty which is approx 3L more than what i want/desire, so had some question specific to Kushaq: 1. Space: We have a 2 year old daughter and we use Car seat at the back? I am given to understand we cannot / should not put the seat in middle, and once you have put the seat at one side, 2 adults cannot sit. My parents are retired so they usually come live with us and we do have the need for 2 adults at back on most occasions. Can some one please provide their experience or feedback on actual comfort? --> This is a primary concern of shortlisting Creta because there 3 adults could sit very comfortably. None of these could be comfortable for you with car seat and 4 adults. Since you are good with Hyundai and Kia levels of safety ratings, I think you need to buy a 2nd-row bench version of Carens or else Alcazar for your use case. With a marginal increase in budget, you would be able to get a very similar or even better car from your Creta/Seltos options, accommodate all of your family and once your daughter grows up, say after 4 years, you can just fold the last row down and use it as a 5 seater with an extended boot.

I love the engine response in this car, because of lower curb weight, it's happy to rev, but overall power and safety seem inadequate now. Till date, I had no extra repair than regular services and tyre change for 8 year old Brio(60k) - she has been very reliable. Budget: around 15 lakh Priorities:Descent power - i cruise at 85-100 on highways, city has very light traffic. Run:8-10k/year with 60% city, 40% highway. Discarded XUV400 for the same reason, price is not justified for my run. Safety - It must have solid frame/body apart from safety features, so Kia is ruled out. Powerful AC is must, as I live in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, temperature easily reaching to 45 in summer. It's scorching in afternoon already! Nice ICE/Clear sound(open to get aftermarket upgrade, if it does not void warranty. I do not need subwoofer, nice speakers are enough) - I like kushaq audio very much! Hated XUV300's audio. Reliability - I do not want to get stranded with occasional road trips I've started taking. Somewhat premium feel and interior space - want to feel upgraded! I cannot be inside all black interiors, feel claustrophobic! open to after market solutions. Descent milage, or I'm okay with milage if base price is lower I will keep only 1 car, as it's jut me and my wife. So it needs to be small enough to go easily with city traffic, big enough for stability on highways. Can compromise on boot for the same.

I feel they may do little more discount probably. Pros: Power seems okay for my need, accelerates quickly. Cabin feels super premium over rivals, I just loved it! Loved the sound! Considering lower numbers, they have it in stock, so no waiting. Doubts: Will it get me stranded on one of my road-trips ? AC performance for 1.0 TSI would be adequate ? XUV300 Another deal I'm getting is 2022 model of XUV 300 W8(O) Petrol 1.2 Turbo(not TGDI or turbo sport) for somewhere below 13L from a friend's dealership. I will compromise on color, but that's okay. Interiors are okay, but they have light grey option, which is great for me, and everything ticks apart from rear AC vent, Music(sound's horrible, my 15k JBL 300W sounds better at home)Milage is low, but considering overall price diff, I can buy fuel for remaining or my budget! Also loved the test drive, the engine is very responsive. Brezza Seems to be the most practical car with milage, and all features, nice speakers. I'm yet to get a test drive. No offence, but Maruti Suzuki Arena seems super lousy, they did not arrange for test drive, no follow up either, makes me question if I will feel upgraded from Honda or degraded! Doubts: Have 4 month waiting period Lacking 6th gear seems incomplete, and has to rev hard even after 80kmph I heard! Not sure I will feel upgraded actually seating inside! Discarded Kia for safety, Hyundai for being too common, but I will test drive creata, just not to miss, Didn't like the Hyrider/Vitara because of bigger on outside, smaller on inside, didn't check other competitors. Nexon seems somewhat smaller, pricier and not so refined.", 26th February 2023,skoda-kushaq,Gandhinagar,3,2,Features/Controls/Displays (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Headliner is old design, you can see it shakes a lot more than the new car parked next to it in the yard. The new one has no flex but the old one even with 1 finger flexes. 2. The door beadings are old and not as thick and padded as the new car. This means rattles will come for sure and can be replaced under warranty. 3. The discs look old since car was parked.

Is this true ? Be it city or highway the 1.5 will give you better FE ONLY if you use it more sedately than a 1.0 driven in the same stretch. The engine never lets you do that and I doubt that the 1.5AT will ever be more efficient if driven back to back by the same driver on the stretch in the same traffic condition. On the highway, the DSG has a seventh cog which means constant cruising + ACT will end up in very good FE, but again when driven at the same speed with a 1.0 in parallel. But driving the 1.5 in a sedate manner is a challenge I have not been able to overcome so far. Over the last 8k kms I did, I had never really used more than half the throttle. Still the acceleration was impressive. Off late, I am addicted to switching to manual mode and accelerating in 3/4th gear and what a pull and feeling The engine note with the turbo in full spool at 4k RPM is beyond anything else. I do this a few minutes before reaching home so that the turbo gets enough time to cool down and one must be careful not to cut throttle abruptly in this scenario since that will lead to backpressure in the intake which will damage the turbo compressor in the longrun.

3109, nilanjanpaik , 10:04 ,Newbie,"(Up/Down)grade from Polo 1.5 TDI highline to Skoda Kushaq 1.0 MT Ambition 8 years & 100k kms later it was time to change the car as my polo started to spend more time in service centers. And VW service in Kolkata is so pathetic every time I sent my car to the service center I became more determined for a switch. Although the service center let me down, I fell in love how the Polo drives. It has got an unparallel handling. So while searching for a new car I was searching for one with similar fun driving characteristics within a budget of 15 lakhs. Sedans ( tried slavia, city) were too long for my parking, creta felt more suitable for chauffeur driven. Hector felt too big as I was upgrading from a hatchback. Tried new Breeza as well. Build quality is flimsy. Did not give me confidence. Same goes for Venue. To be honest I was ready to settle for a Polo TSI, and was cursing VW for discontinuing it. Then tested the Taigun. It was nice, familiar cabin, handling. But that big chromes in the front was a turn off. Also I am never a fan of digital instrument cluster. Something about those analog speedometer I just love. They also did not offer me a good price for my old car. Kushaq looked better, got my analog instrument cluster, and they gave me almost 40k more for my old car. So booked the Kushaq in September. After two months wait, got my car end of November. Now some of the features I miss from my old polo: 1. Window control from the car key. Absolutely fabulous feature. A 15 lakh car must have this. I don't like going back to the car, keying it in to close the window. 2. OneTouch window control for all windows. 3. That wonderful flat bottom steering wheel. The kushaq's steering wheel is nice, but ergonomics of the Polo steering wheel was better. 4. The touch ac control is not good, i still have to take my eye off even after 4 months driving. Polo's physical buttons were better. 5. 1.0 TSI seems underpowered at low rev until the turbo kicks off especially when I compare it with my 1.5l TDI. 6. The automatic engine shut down in traffic seemed too aggressive. When in bumper to bumper traffic, you cannot take your feet from clutch. Even if I take foot off for two seconds the engine shuts down. It's annoying. 7. Quality of materials and plastic seem inferior to polo. 8. Instrument cluster for my 8 year old polo was more posh and cleaner than this 2022 Kushaq. The MID could have used some more pixels. 8. Instrument cluster doesn't light up unless you switch on the headlight. This seemed to be a bug with my car, need to get it checked during my first service. Now some good things: 1. Handling is great. Although polo felt better, probably because of its low centre of gravity. 2. Pocket Hercules of an engine. The tiny 3 cylinder 1 liter packs so much punch! I could do good speeds on Durgapur expressway without touching red lines. 3. Very confident handling on high speed, the steering weighs up nicely. The super build quality and extra weight keeps the car planted. 4. The engine is so versatile. It gives you super mileage if you don't push it, but when you do push the engine, it surprises you. 5. Leg space was a problem with polo, upgrading to the Kushaq solved it. On a summary Kushaq is a nice rounded car with killer looks and I am happy with the purchase. But it shows me how good and complete the Polo was. Undoubtedly polo was the best hatchback of our generation.", 4th March 2023,skoda-kushaq,Kolkata,2,19,Entertainment/Navigation/Connectivity (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
3110, Nazy , 16:36 ,Newbie,"Hello everyone, It's my first post on TeamBHP and I am looking for advice regarding my next car. I own a 2013 Skoda Rapid 1.6 Diesel with MT and after exchanging the same the best quotes I could get for Brezza ZXI+ MT is 12.52 lakhs on road (including extended warranty upto 5 years/1 lakh kms and 11,200 worth of accessories) and for Skoda Kushaq 1.0 TSI Ambition MT is 12.7 lakhs on road (including 10,400 worth of accessories). Things in favour of Kushaq: 1. 5 star NCAP safety raiting. 2. Solid build quality. 3. Premium looks(both exterior and interior) 4. Powerful and fun to drive engine 5. Premium touchscreen infotainment and UI 6. Nice speakers Cons: 1. Only 2 airbags with Ambient model 2. Engine vibrations 3. Gear knob on manual version feels jerky and noisy while shifting as compared to both my Skoda Rapid and Brezza Things in favour of Brezza: 1. 6 air bags 2. 360° camera 3. Better camera quality 4. Better road view and commanding driving position. 5. Cabin feels roomier than Kushaq mainly due to its more vertical windows. 6. Very refined 1.5 ltr engine and also feels punchier than Kushaq's 1.0 turbo at lower rpms and lower speeds. 7. Other features that Brezza has over Kushaq but don't mean much to me personally are: sunroof, HUD, 'hybrid system' Cons: 1. Poor interiors and plastic quality. 2. Unknown NCAP safety rating. 3. Okay-ish Infotainment system UI and speaker quality. Apart from the points mentioned above another important factor is the resale value, maintenance cost and ease of repair(in terms of spare parts and repair shop availability) where Maruti Suzuki is the obvious winner. Overall Brezza looks like a more financially sound choice here but Kushaq appeals more to the heart. As far as the requirements are considered, the car will be driven mostly in the NCR region for short 10km commutes, 50-60km once or twice a week outings within NCR and twice monthly highway trips of 350-400kms. I am an active driver and enjoy weaving through traffic during commutes within NCR and keep the car below 120kmph on expressways and around 80-100 on other highways.

I'll try and describe the Kushaq's A/C for you. I drive a 1.5 DSG. The A/C is pretty useless if set at 22 degrees or higher. The performance is okay if you set it lower than that. My default setting is 20. The fan is really weird. It seems like there is an inherent design flaw that prevents it from circulating air properly. It either creates a lot of draft or none at all. You are always fiddling with the system. You cannot set it on auto and forget about it. It creates these pockets of hot and cold air so you are tweaking it during a drive. The recirculation feature has its own mind. The HVAC system is noisy overall. Ventilated seats work well and it's switched on 100% of the time in my case. If you are buying the Kushaq, buying a version with ventilated seats is mandatory. It's not a deal breaker in my opinion as the car is lovely to drive but is a significant irritant that detracts from the overall experience.

Nothing drives like the Polo. I hate VW for having discontinued it. All the newer cars they have can't hold a candle to the Polo. Quote: 1. Window control from the car key. Absolutely fabulous feature. A 15 lakh car must have this. I don't like going back to the car, keying it in to close the window. 2. OneTouch window control for all windows. 1 & 2 go together. Since they have done away with one touch feature to control costs, they can't give the key fob window control. It is an underrated feature. My Karoq has the key fob control. And it opens and closes the Sunroof too! Neat. My dad drives a 1.0MT Ambition Kushaq and I didn't even know it came with Idle Start/Stop!! Are you sure yours isn't Style or 1.5? Quote: 8.

I have noticed that it lights up inside tunnels or underpasses even if the headlight is off but it doesn't inside the basement parking. Don't know how it works.

3129, tsi_niks1989 , 23:17 ,BHPian,"Hi Folks, Our Kushaq completed 11k KMs in a span of one year and we took it for the yearly service. Just thought of sharing the overall experience along with the service costs. Service was done at Speedworks Skoda, Lucknow. We did not purchase the service package at the time of car purchase and had only opted for extended warranty. Service experience was very good and I was surprised to see the level of attention our car was given. We had booked our appointment couple of weeks in advance and were greeted well at the service center. We reached sharp at 10:30 am as requested by the service advisor and our car was up for inspection within 10 minutes. Updates requested: 1. Doors rattling check 2. Horn Upgrade 3. Bonnet insulation 4. Aluminium Pedals For point 3 and 4, they have requested for 3-4 days and agreed to install these parts at our home. Our Kushaq is from the 1st batch and rattles quite a bit, they have put a tape across the doors after properly cleaning and applying some spray. Unfortunately, though rattles have reduced but not completely eliminated. There are still few rattle noises coming from somewhere . After scanning, they mentioned an update for AC is being shown which needs to be done to which we agreed, however we have faced no issues with the AC cooling. Returning home after the service, it felt a bit better than earlier but need to test more. Now the best part, finally we have the horn which we were missing from earlier VW cars, the scooty and bike type horn has now been replaced by trumpet ones , will share the part number here. We also enquired if we can swap Ambition/Style model headlights to which they politely refused-reason being different wiring harness. Total bill for the service was 6053 INR (1st service so no labour charges). Horn was 1500 so in total we paid 7553 for the 1st year service. Service experience has been very satisfactory with Speedworks, Skoda Lucknow. The overall experience with the car as well has been delightful with a smile every time you drive it. Surely recommended for anyone who loves to drive.

It seems like there is an inherent design flaw that prevents it from circulating air properly. It either creates a lot of draft or none at all. You are always fiddling with the system. You cannot set it on auto and forget about it. It creates these pockets of hot and cold air so you are tweaking it during a drive. The recirculation feature has its own mind. The HVAC system is noisy overall. Ventilated seats work well and it's switched on 100% of the time in my case. If you are buying the Kushaq, buying a version with ventilated seats is mandatory. It's not a deal breaker in my opinion as the car is lovely to drive but is a significant irritant that detracts from the overall experience.

3159, CoolFire , 22:48 ,BHPian,"For everyone concerned about the AC issues and power window problems, here is an important update. I did the latest software update last week and both the issues seems to have gone away for now. I own a Kushaq 1.0 AT Stile variant (Oct 2021 make bought in Jan 2022). Like many kushaq owners, I too had some issues right from the beginning. The major ones and how these were solved is as follows. Luckily the ECU issue, fuel pump problems and door or dash squeaks were not present in my car. 1. AC issue. This was the biggest one. On medium hot days (that is only what we have in Kerala) the blow from AC felt more like a room cooler. The first year service, which I did in January made it a little better. The latest update done last week seems to have made it a lot better. The cooling is now effective enough that I have to reduce cooling by a degree or two sometimes which never happened earlier. The blow speed is actually lesser, but the air feels much cooler now. Still, it is no match for a Tata or Toyota AC - just good enough for my needs. A setting of 22 degrees in Kushaq even now is only as good as a 26 in our Corolla Altis. 2. Power window problem The driver side power window kept going back halfway and sometimes took 2-3 attempts to close. The service engineer (at EVM Kochi) had told me during the first year service that changing the switch or motor is still not effective and asked me to wait for the next update. This time (last week) they called me offering update on AC, but I insisted on the power window solution also. The service gal told me that the power window motor's chip needed to be rewritten along with ECU update for this to work. I told them I am willing to leave the car for the day and should get it done. They did it and it is working fine now. Fingers crossed as I have heard it has come back for many owners, but my feeling is that the process this time may have done the trick. 3. Screeching noise from brakes This was a big irritant in the initial months, but luckily went away by itself once the car crossed around 4K kms. The failure with Skoda on this is on two counts - the issue should not been there in the first place and even when people complained they did not know or could assure that it will go away afterwards!! Anyway thankful that it is gone. 4. Too much power when launching from standstill This too felt odd in the initial period. I haven't felt like it in any of my earlier cars, but here you had to be very careful with a foot on the brake when launching the vehicle everytime. This was especially bad when you had to reverse in tight spaces. This too Skoda didn't knew much about and the service guys even told me it was the nature of the gear ratio and you have to live with it. Surprisingly the issue kept receding and I think the launch power became quite normal around 5k kms. 5. Periodic beeps while playing music This was felt in the first few days and this very TeamBHP thread told me that it was caused by the native music app. I immediately removed both the maps and music apps I had downloaded earlier and the issue never resurfaced. I hadn't tried those apps ever since. 6. AC controls going berserk I felt several times that the AC controls by themselves were going into a different mode - like when in auto mode it will change to manual etc. Soon realised that it was not a bug, but a nature of the very sensitive touch controls. Just being careful not to touch the controls by accident solves this one. Still I miss those blessed rotary controls for AC settings. Also, I dread of a future where a single screen controls everything like many cars these days. Apart from the weak engines, this is one reason I am telling myself for not going for the new Bimmer X1 7. Whistiling noise from AC when vent is closed This is a very minor thing, but still unsolved. The vents on both ends, when fully closed makes a small whistling sound. I never read about this anywhere , but is still present for me. Not much of an issue because in my car those are seldom closed. All said, today I am a very happy owner. Enjoying the fine ride characteristics and confident in our crazy roads about the top safety ratings this one has got. Also, being 6'2"" tall, there are not many cars in this class in which I can sit really comfortably in both front and rear seats. The longer wheelbase is really useful in this aspect. Meanwhile, the smaller outer dimensions make my usage in all the congested roads and parking spaces in my home town a breeze. In fact, it somehow feels much easier to drive around and park than both the Corolla and even the shorter Ecosport which we have. I hope this account will help the owners who are still trying to figure out how to solve these issues and also those looking to buy any of the Skoda/VW 2.0 cars.", 29th March 2023,skoda-kushaq,"Tsr,",386,573,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Similarly at night when I turn on the parking lights (rotate the knob just once ) the instrument cluster remains dark however the other control panels lit up Is it by design or any issue in the car, 12th May 2023,skoda-kushaq,GGN/CHD,73,102,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

Totally agree, but what I experienced with my Taigun is that even with highbeams, the light fades pretty quickly in the highways, and if there is oncoming traffic with high beams, it becomes quite difficult. On the other hand, the low beam is excellent with a good cutout pattern, good enough for slower speeds in the city - I rarely have to switch to highbeams.", 13th May 2023,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore,95,173,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Similarly at night when I turn on the parking lights (rotate the knob just once ) the instrument cluster remains dark however the other control panels lit up Is it by design or any issue in the car Hi Arkanile, I have Taigun 1.0 AT and have a similar issue of instrument cluster going dark. I have asked my Service Advisor couple of times to look into it but they have not been able to do anything. I would like to highlight that it is a risk and I don't agree that it is a safety feature. At minimum, it should not remain dark when parking lights are switched on. In none of the other cars that I have driven, do the Instrument cluster lighting don't change to light mode when parking lights are switched on. I am speculating that this is a software issue which was designed for auto headlights and that auto feature has been removed in the Ambition model. So the software waits for the light to be fully swicthed on for the cluster to change its illumination. I would also like to ask you to see post #2727 in this thread where the person has highlighted that the issue has been solved by software upgrade. This is what he said: ""The backlight of the instrument cluster - Earlier it did not use to turn on during the time of low light situations, for example at dawn or dusk. Now it stays on."" Do let me know if you find a solution for this. Thanks.", 22nd May 2023,skoda-kushaq,Mumbai,56,56,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Assume this car is a second hand car with 15k km run (no way to know how it was driven /test driven), would you buy it at the quoted price? I went and visited the Audi Approved showroom in my city. They also had Kushaq Ambition 1.0 AT and Taigun Topline 1.0 AT. They were from same batch as the earlier car that I saw. Nov 2021 registration from Pune. All run about 22-26 kms. He said these are corporate cars and used by company employees or within the plant. He categorically denied these are not test drive vehicles. The car again felt good and without issues. The advantages here are - 1. He confirmed no service has been done yet and they will do the first servicing before the purchase 2. He confirmed they will do denting painting for some minor scratches on the body 3. He confirmed that the car comes with extended warranty of 1 year. So the car is in warranty till Nov 2026 4. He is giving me a better deal of 13.15L inclusive of RC transfer and and comprehensive insurance Nov 2023 and third party till Nov 2024. I'm thinking of going with this one as it is coming from Audi Approved rather than some car dealer. Also, they're giving me servicing and denting painting in the cost. I also saw a 2020 Nexon EV XZ+ Lux with 22k on odo from 2020. The dealer is ready to give it at 13.5L inclusive of everything. While the car seemed perfectly fine & will save huge money in city driving, it will be inconvenient for highway drives. Also, I don't want to buy an EV older than 2022. Will be making a decision soon on Kushaq. But for now, it looks like I might go with Audi Approved as they seem authentic.", 26th June 2023,skoda-kushaq,Nashik,46,82,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Ask them to do a complete scan of the car in front of you and show you the results. 3. Ask them if all the campaigns/bulletins that have been issued by VW/Skoda, have been carried out for your particular model. Ask them to show you this in the system. If not, make them do so. 4. Check the tread depth of the tyres and check for any uneven wear. 5. Check the condition of the brake pedal (if its worn from one corner or one end).

But the pricing for the turbo variant was really ridiculous and I immediately dropped it. I had test driven Baleno Alpha AMT and Brezza ZXi. Baleno did not meet my criteria for a tall car with good GC, but it was still my fall back compromised option. Brezza I liked overall, but could not get a test drive of automatic for over a month, and the waiting period was over 6 months. All through this, I was keeping an eye out for a pre-owned car and finally managed to find a Kushaq 1.0 Ambition AT model at a local dealer. The car is owned by Skoda Volkswagen, 1.5 year old and 15k on ODO. I was getting the car for 13L all inclusive. I felt it was a great deal considering the car felt almost new. For barely 1.5 lakh over Baleno, I was getting a bigger, sturdier car which is way more fun to drive. While I could not test drive the Fronx turbo, I'm sure the VW 1.0 turbo engine is much more fun compared to boosterjet. I started the search by wanting a turbo petrol CSUV at around 13-13.5L price point. I concluded the search by buying a turbo petrol SUV for 13L, albeit pre-owned.

3254, thanixravindran , 19:17 ,BHPian,"Last week, I visited the service centre to get the software update for the driver side window issue and more importantly to get the wheel balancing and alignment done as I do it at 10K intervals. I booked an appointment but was 30 mins late in the morning due to OMR traffic. It was a week day but service centre is heavily crowded with cars. There is not even space to park the cars freely. It is nice to see so many Kushaq's coming for service but alarmed how they are going to handle the volume. Since I endured the traffic already, I decided to get it done anyway. Service advisor did a quick check and gave the form. It is a mistake not to have taken photos of car as Skoda still uses old paper style service form. I gave the car by 10AM and went to the lounge. To my surprise couple of people who gave car for service are working from there. After participating involuntarily in their laptop teams calls for sometime, decided to go to Starbucks next door to spend some time. More surprise, it has turned into free co working space itself with free WiFI. People taking a walk in between work too across coffee tables Around lunch time, saw in the app that car went to test drive after wheel alignment, so decided to return to service centre. I also got a call for my interest in accessories. Upon enquiring for puddle lamp, I was told it is only for Top end as it only has connector to take the puddle lamp. Disappointed with Skoda, just picked up the boot mat and door sill protector which were long overdue. Now to make things interesting, there is small fresh dent in rear right door. I am sure it was not there in the morning when I started home. SA told it was there when I gave it to him but he didn't marked it in the form. He is a young guy and was polite despite overwhelmed by the crowd and I reminded myself being in India, so gave up without arguing. I simply don't want to waste time there and get into even poor workmanship trying to fix it. It was already close to 3.00PM and I need to to go for an appointment. So took the vehicle and went. It will serve as a reminder in future to be there in service bay rather than participating in other teams calls or enjoying a coffee.

Even if you get the complete assembly replaced with the ones from ambition/active which have halogen units, the intensity of the lights aren't good, so you won't gain anything, plus you'll loose warranty.

This time also I personally went on a weekday taking leave thinking it will be a smooth affair. I tried to go early but they generally will be available by 9.30 AM only.

The majority of the time they themselves outsource it, add a margin and serve no value addition. Skoda is notorious for not honoring warranty. They will even cite outside rubber mats for engine trouble . I confirmed with them 10k interval is ok as I don't want any suspension related warranty issues in future. So I will stick with them till warranty and extended warranty. I don't think they outsourced but did in house. The dent and two paint marks in door is of tools which I figured out while washing at home. For i10 wheel alignment, I generally do outside each 10k KMs. Post warranty, Kushaq will follow the same.

I'd also like to get some general reviews on Jai Auto as a dealer and the service centres in Gurgaon. Originally, I had booked a Kushaq from Jai Auto. However, I ended up purchasing it from another dealer due to the quicker availability of my desired variant and color. While I could have obtained my preferred variant from Jai Auto with a waiting period of just 3-4 more days, I needed the car by a specific date. When I contacted them to cancel my booking, they were very friendly and promptly processed the refund. They even deposited the refund cheque themselves and I did not have to visit them even once during the cancellation period. Though I did not buy my car from them, I do get it serviced at their service centre. I visited them once for a checkup and oil top up at 8,000 KMs and was very happy with the service. For the 15,000 KMs service, I opted for their home pick-up and drop-off facility, which once again proved to be a highly pleasant experience. I have also visited them once to get the dual tone horn installed, and once more to buy some accessories. It has been very pleasant engaging with them during each visit. Mr Anand was my sales advisor/manager. Every time I visit the service centre, I remember to say Hi to him and chat with him about Skoda cars. Now to answer your bullet points: Since I had already negotiated a good discount, I went with Skoda Insurance. I also renewed the insurance this year through them since they called and offered a good deal on renewal. I recommend selecting the highest IDV value, along with Zero Depreciation, Return to Invoice, and Engine Protect add-ons/features. If my understanding is correct, the IDV for a new car should be precisely 5% less than the billed ex-showroom price; however, someone on this forum might be able to confirm or correct this calculation. I got the extended warranty at the time of purchase since it's costlier later. Infact, I got the ""Car + Extended Warranty + Elite Insurance + 4 Years' Service Package"" to ensure a worry-free ownership.

Also, I don't use the AC much because I smoke in the car. Roughly 40% of the 1076 km would have been with the AC on. The fuel I use is HP's Power 95 octane.

I think there are few factors that work in your favour: 1. Your running distance of 70 km - I have noticed that this car struggles to get decent mileage over shorter runs. 2. Highway driving - car does manage respectable mileage when driven consistently at same speed. My commute almost never allows for that, resulting in mileage mostly in range of 12-15 kmpl. 3. AC off - I personally haven't tested how much impact this has, but I assume it must be adding another 1-2 kmpl. Just curious, how much has your car run and how many services you've had?

3309, NewEnthusiasm , 14:10 ,Newbie,"Hi Team-BHPians! This is my first post on the forum; thanks Team-BHP for letting me in the circle. First off, I would really like to thank everyone for providing such detailed and useful information on the platform; it really helps an under-informed person like me to come up to speed related to any-and-all issues related to buying a car, which is obviously a complex task. I'll now come to my question. TLDR version: I live in Mumbai and primarily will drive from office to home (5 kms one way) apart from the usual weekend outing. Should I go for the 1.5 DSG Kushaq transmission or not? Longer version: I have*driven an I10 for over 10 years, and a Baleno once in a while for 2 years (my brother's car). I am looking for an upgrade, and have always wanted to get a racy, sporty car (with automatic transmission for the city commute). I came across the Kushaq and took 2 test drives of the 1.5 ltr DSG. I immediately fell for it. It's just very sporty and can set the heart racing. While the 1.0 turbos and 1.5 NA engines of the competition are also powerful, this 1.5 feels like a significant upgrade. Since I'll majorly be driving within Mumbai city with its bumper*to bumper traffic, I feel the 1.0 turbo will not be able to give the same oomph because of the turbo lag. However, since I will be driving in the city majorly (with the occasional weekend trip), should I even go for the 1.5 DSG? I read that the DSG is prone to heating in city traffic with frequent use of clutch for adequate gearing. Can anyone who uses the 1.5 automatic in cities like Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai kindly comment on their experience? While I haven't*yet read too many instances of failure of the new DSG, i'm not sure what to expect. I also understand the fast crawl of the car can be irksome in city traffic. The DSG concern brings me to the other, much bigger issue: reliability. This forum and other forums are littered with posts of niggles and issues with the car. While some common ones (rattling, AC) were attributed to the 2021 batch of production, I can still see people having issues with it. I also see many new issues coming up (fit and finish issues, car breakdowns, etc). For many people, the car seems to have visited the service centre multiple times within the first few months of purchase, which is not what a new buyer wants to experience. This ties in to the next issue: service experience. so many people have complained about long wait times for even figuring out the problem, apart from long time taken to actually service the issue. Skoda dealers and service centres continue to bring the brand down. I would also like to provide a counterpoint: I know of some people who have had a blissful run even two years into ownership. However, purchasing the car seems like playing with loaded dice: you could be unlucky and spend a lot of time and effort chasing the dealership, service centres and the company itself. While i'd really love to own the car, these things are holding me back. Would love to hear from the forum what their experience has been related to 1.5 DSG in cities. As can be made out: while I like sportiness, I will prefer peace of mind and reliability. I'm not really a car person who would know the insides-and-out of the machine, so the latter points become specially important. I'm also looking at safety, so the Hyundai twins with their turbo engines are down the pecking order (however I'm still on the lookout for revised NCAP ratings for the new Seltos). I'm also not dazzled by features such as sun-roof or even ADAS for that matter (in terms of practicality in the Indian context) so the price delta is a little hard to digest for me. Another point: I've put a budget of 15-20L for myself (a little here and there is fine). I took a test drive of the Honda Elevate. It seems like a good mix of reliability, comfort and good enough power. I think it performs at par if not better than the 1.0 Kushaq.*For me, it becomes a very strong fall back option with the advantage of a known engine and transmission plus 'Peace-of-mind' that comes with the Honda City platform which I believe the Elevate is based on. It only lacks the kick that comes with 1.5 ltr Kushaq for me.

As you very rightly said, this is one place you'll find loads of information and finer details that perhaps no other forum or medium offers. About the 1.5 DSG, I was smitten by the refinement, power and fun that this transmission delivers. However, I've ruled it out because my daily commute involves crawling traffic and the dry clutch offered with the 1.5 engine is not a fan of those conditions. I checked with current owners and received suggestions that included shifting to M mode, coasting in neutral etc. Frankly speaking, my motivation to buy an automatic is to be able to drive stress free - both physically and mentally. I have also driven the 1.0 AT and that is definitely fun to drive too. In fact, I did not experience any lack of power on lower rpms at slower speeds. The niggles definitely are a cause for concern. I'm seeing posts from recent owners complaining of occurrence of known issues. I have a booking for the Elevate and recently completed a long test drive. I must say I'm very impressed with the 1.5 iVTEC CVT combination. S mode allows good acceleration on demand and the drive itself is very smooth. A very competent fallback, if I may say. On a related note, I see a lot of potential buyers torn between the VW/Skoda twins and the Elevate. I believe you'll not go wrong with either. I actually like the nice styling and subtle road presence the Kushaq offers, but the Honda is no sloch and an great overall package. Do take a longer test drive of the Elevate before you decide anything. Good luck.", 10th September 2023,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore,761,"2,054","Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

As a fellow Mumbaikar, and also a fellow lurker between a few models (& smitten mainly with the Kushaq!) I can understand where you’re coming from. But from reading your post it seems to me you didn’t take a TD of the 1.0 TC Kushaq? If not please do so. My TDs in traffic with the DSG weren’t as awesome as the open road ones. And in all fairness the sporty nature and oomph of the 1.0 is really quite good plus if takes care of the reliability too. So if you’re a very ‘fill it, shut it, forget it’ type of car owner and still love the Kushaq, maybe do extensive TDs of the 1.0 - call for the car near your commute area and spend some time in traffic. And give it a good run on the open road when you get some - I’m sure you won’t be disappointed with the 1.0 too The 1.5 is like a prize horse - but I feel in your case the occasional weekend run might not need the bigger engine, even the 1.0 is quite fun on the open road. Also for DSGs, I refer everyone to one of the great threads here by @JoshMachine. https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/techn...ml#post4547770 (DSG, demystified! All you need to know about VW's Direct-Shift Gearbox) The Elevate is a different beast altogether. More staid, no nonsense, also bulkier and has more ‘presence’ than the Kushaq imo. I haven’t done a TD since it wasn’t available then but my initial impression sitting in it was it’s a seemed like a more ‘grown up’ car, while Kushaq seemed more snazzy and ‘young’ for want of a better metaphor. But all things aside, if your heart is set on the 1.5 DSG, then go for it. No car is perfect and my personal opinion - it’s better to go for what you love than settle for what everyone tells you is better.

3319, mdesai_1981 , 23:59 ,BHPian,"Hey people, So I have to tell you this small but important incident that happened with me. I happened to have purchased a Skoda Kushaq Monte Carlo 1.5 DSG in July,23. Me and my wife have driven the same for about 1500kms till now with a mix of 80% highway and 20% city. About two days back I observed that steering was making this peculiar noise on turning. Something which quite likely pointed out to faulty suspension mount bearings.

This is probably because of the higher torque of the 1.5 engine. Higher torque means the car gets to a specific speed fast consuming less fuel, especially in heavy highway traffic where frequent braking is necessary.

What is the general efficiency seen when driving in city drives? Is the infamous AC issue in 1.0 cars resolved? 1. 1.0 engine and AT combo is more than enough for city driving. In fact, I feel the turbo lag is well masked and the engine feels over-enthusiastic to close that gap especially in lower gears. 2. Depends a lot on your distance. When driven for short distances (under 10km), I've found it difficult to extract more than 10 kmpl no matter how sedately I drive. On longer distances, you can get 12-14 kmpl if driven carefully. Carefully means avoiding flat out acceleration & using car roll-on & brakes wisely. 3. AC is inadequate if you're driving under a hot sun. It needs to be under 20 degrees and on high blower to be effective. For normal temperatures, it's alright. Where this car shines is in cabin space and driveability.

3325, ap28 , 12:37 ,Newbie,"As a Skoda owner, one challenge we have been facing is that there is no Skoda service centre in the city so we have to travel to Kolhapur which is about 121kms from the city. I was facing a couple of issues with the car lately. The co-driver's window was making noise while rolling the window up & down. When the car was inspected, the mechanic mentioned that the winder motor needs to be replaced. I had then booked an appointment at Shrine Skoda in Kolhapur and my husband & I went there to get the part replaced. For this work, we both had to take leave from our offices. We had to take a day off from our office for this as it was communicated to us that at Shrine Auto, this work can only be done between Mondays- Fridays. I had then taken an appointment for 11th August and before leaving on that day, I had informed the service manager as well that we are leaving for the workshop so they could align the work. While giving the car for repairs, I had also highlighted to the service manager some issues that we were facing with the car apart from the winder issue: 1. Brakes were screeching upon braking so service manager that that he will look into it and get it fixed for now 2. Cabin light wiring was loose since upon just touching the button, the light goes on and off on its own. Now comes the challenges due to which I am writing to you: 1. ISSUES WITH MY SKODA KUSHAQ: a) I received the car and upon inspecting, the window was still making noise and the issue hadn't been resolved which was highlighted to the mechanics present during the time of delivery. b) I observed that there were some scratches being made on the outside plastic part of the window which I had highlighted to the mechanics who were present there while we were inspecting the vehicle. Attaching an image for reference. c) The other issues I had highlighted were not taken care of since the braking and the light wiring issues still persist. d) The car was not even washed and cleaned before delivery. e) The service manager was not present during the time of delivery of the vehicle 2. MANUFACTURING QUALITY - Firstly, I purchased a Skoda considering that it is a premium brand and there won't be such issues since VW is a renowned German brand and this wasn't expected from such a top class brand like Skoda due to which I purchased the car. Parts installed in the car are of poor quality as compared to VW and other models of Skoda. 3. SERVICE CENTRES - I am surprised how you people are only focussed towards top tier metros and ignoring the other cities and Belagavi being one of the Smart Cities.VW also have their service centre here but amazed to see that Skoda doesn't have their presence. 4. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE: Nobody from Shrine Auto, Kolhapur has bothered to call ever since they completed the job on the car and ask about the feedback as I strongly believe that they don't care much about it since they are aware about us not being happy with the job done in the car. I travelled 250kms to Kolhapur & back and to again visit Shrine for the issue which is due to the company's poor quality part & poor handling of the vehicle by mechanics of Shrine, I would have to make another trip to Kolhapur which would be a total of 500kms. I am hoping that you are going to compensate for the fuel since I am wasting my money, energy & time to travel all the way for an issue which is not caused due to the owner's mistake. Had the issue been taken care of in our city of residence itself, it still wouldn't have been that much of an issue since it is of utmost inconvenience to us. We as owners are suffering and wasting our precious time as we are working professionals. Traveling 3.5-4 hours one-side during weekdays costs us taking a holiday for this. I had called Shrine 2 weeks back raising my concerns and spoke to their Head of Customer Relations. They were supposed to speak to the service manager and call me back but it has been a while now and there has not been any communication from their end that would address any of the issues and about fixing the winder issue. I am disappointed to see that Skoda India has been providing such poor quality service to their car owners. Totally uncalled for.

Sadly though my post is about strange things Skoda has been up to. I took delivery of my Kushaq Style 1.0 on 20 Oct 2023. I found out through Team-bhp that Skoda has recently degraded the alloys for the style model. Although I had few concerns as I booked the car with dual tone alloys. I still went ahead with the delivery as cancelation process would have been very painful through CSD and my first installment of the loan was already deducted before delivery (I know its strange but delivery got delayed by a month due to some paper work issues between CSD and dealer). During delivery SA told me that this car does not have a dongle, per him usually style variant has it. Today I noticed that my car does not even have paper holding bands in front door pockets, this is something Skoda has been promoting as simply clever feature. Now I am getting worried that how to find what all this Style variant is missing from the previous one and why. Is it not Skoda's responsibility to inform customers. Why should we pay the same price for models which randomly miss features. I am sure the 2023 Kushaq style has these paper holding bands. My car is July manufactured.

The 1.5 Ambition is still under 20L on road. I am sorry to hear about your Jazz experience, was it serviced by the authorized service center all along? I think Elevate is a solid choice under 20L for automatic and you get the top end ZX CVT for just under 20L with cruise control and great interiors.

3369, VBHYD , 14:39 ,Newbie,Finally decided to go with Skoda Kushaq Ambition 1.0 l AT.Following points tilted my interest towards Kushaq rather than Honda Elevate. 1.Rear seat ( middle) of elevate is narrow and my 8 year old kid was not comfortable with 2 other adults seated 2. Engine Sound is minimal in Kushaq and Turbo 1.0l is way above than Honda Elevate NA 1.5l. I drove both on the Necklace road stretch and just got blown away by the handling and ride quality of Kushaq. 3.Key useful features like Cruise control and back seat arm rest are missing in Honda V& VX variants. 4. Finally the price factor and Standard Maintenance package played the role. Kushaq Ambition 1.0 l was priced around 3 lacs less than Honda top variant which I was looking forward to buying.

3395, agm , 11:31 ,BHPian,"Hello my fellow Team Bhpians I am giving a serious thought of buying a new mid size pseudo SUV. Initially my plan was to get either Virtus or Slavia, which made me fall in love with sedan segment once again. Although it has got a fair amount of ground clearance but after my recent 2000km road trip i have realised that even 179mm of GC can be a big a problem. Eventually after taking all the aspects in consideration decided to stick with a Mid-sized SUV. I’m in my late thirties and this new car will be mostly driven by me with couple of long road trips with my family. I want something which will bring smile to my face when I’m behind the wheels. New KIA Seltos was one of my first choice with new 1.5 DCT, but then after couple of test drives, for some reason I could not connect with it. I have driven Taigun extensively and I know how good it is to drive, even with that smaller 1.0 TC combination. Is it worth taking a chance with VAG cars, especially given their reputation of below average A.S.S and highly unreliable DQ200 DSG? I’ll be going with maximum coverage but then it’ll only help me financially but I don’t want to be stranded in the middle of no where because of some reliability problems.

3397, Aurelius , 12:47 ,Newbie,"Skoda Monte Carlo: Local Repair vs. Authorized Service Center Dear Team-BHPians, Since July 2023, I've been enjoying my 1.0 Monte Carlo AT, taking it on several long family trips (over 1000 km) and appreciating its driving fun. Recently, during parking, my car sustained a scratch, and the fog lamp and headlight were pushed inwards. Although the light functions normally, I've consulted a local detailing and garage service for repair and detailing. Their quote is 5k, which seems reasonable. However, the authorized Skoda service center is 30 km away, and with traffic, the journey would take 1.5-2 hours, which I'd prefer to avoid. My dilemma: Local repair: Pros: Faster turnaround (1-2 days) Lower cost (5k) Local service with good reputation Cons: Potential warranty voidance (although the 6-year warranty includes 2 years of purchased extension) Unfamiliarity with Skoda's specific repair methods and parts Authorized service center: Pros: Guaranteed warranty compliance Use of genuine Skoda parts and repair procedures Cons: Longer turnaround (5 days experienced by colleague) Higher cost (10k for similar repairs on colleague's car) Time-consuming travel (30 km + traffic) Image of the damaged headlight attached. Seeking advice: Will getting the repairs done locally affect the warranty in any way? Considering the pros and cons mentioned, what would your recommendation be?

3399, maverick_kushaq , 01:11 ,Newbie,"TLDR: Previously non-existent clutch issue started after giving my car for second service. Service center initially denied any issue in clutch, later mentioned it's a Major Issue. - My car was due for second service and it was all fine except for few minor issues (driver side window issue, friction noise from the clutch pedal while releasing the clutch). So I took it to service on 21st Nov. I had asked the service advisor to fix these problems which they had done. But unfortunately, soon after getting it from service, I realised it had a new problem. The clutch was behaving very weird. Clutch pedal started going half way as if it's dead and the clutch got engaged only after the second half. And when de-pressing the pedal, the car will suddenly disengage clutch on slight de-press and will cause jerk. This happens only when I don't press the clutch pedal with sudden full pressure. However, if I put a sudden pressure while pressing the pedal, it was behaving normally. I had immediately called up the service advisor and informed him about it and he mentioned, it'll get adjusted after driving for a few kms. Naive me belived this and drove for a few days but the issue persisted. On Dec 5th, again I called up the service advisor and mentioned it's still happening and he asked me to visit the service center. However due to busy work schedule, I couldn't go. Finally managed to make some time on Dec 9th, I took my car again to the service center. The service advisor asked some technician to check the issue. The technician checked and denied any issue despite himself feeling the difference. He even tried showing other Kushaq also has a clutch similar behaviour and that it's intentionally done to avoid clutch plate wear. However he couldn't prove that to me in any other Kushaq. Having driven for 2 years, I knew how my clutch behaved and it was definitely not normal and I stood my ground. But the technician continued to be in complete denial although he seemed to know about the issue(I doubted he knew, because he mentioned he'll try bleeding the clutch and that might help in fixing the issue). Technician took my car to bleed, and asked me to wait inside. While waiting, my service advisor, completely disregarding the problem, started finding if I've given him the service feedback for my 2nd service and started asking me if I've recieved the message and if I've given the feedback. I told I probably have missed the feedback link sms/email. He started insisting me to check if I've recieved the sms/email and infact went through my messages to find the sms with the feedback link. It was so egregious that he was worried about the feedback while I'm worried about new problem being introduced after the service. Meanwhile the technician tried bleeding, but that still didn't fix the issue. Again he started going into the denial mode that it's not an issue. I continued standing my ground. Then later he again took the car inside the service area and he discussed something with service advisor and he came back and mentioned while taking the car inside he also felt that it's behaving abnormally and that he noticed it after pressing the clutch pedal multiple times(tried covering up for his denial). He said I'll have to leave my car in the service center for a day since it would take 3-4 hours for the fix. I insisted that I would wait there and get it fixed. But he denied and asked me to talk to the service advisor. I mentioned the same to the service advisor also and he initially said it's not possible to do it that day as it would take time. On further insistence of waiting there to get it fixed, the service advisor now started telling me it would take 3-4 DAYS! to fix it. When I pointed out that technician mentioned it would take 3-4 hours, this service advisor was not even ready to listen and continued saying it'll take 3-4 days and since it was Saturday, he mentioned they'll take up the work on Monday. However since I really needed my car that day due to personal reasons, I told him, that I'll get it back to service center on Monday. But this time he mentioned it's a Major Issue in the clutch, and insisted me to leave the car. But I had to take my car and they warned you can take it if you're not driving anywhere far. All this while I thought these Skoda service centers are just bad at fixing things. Didn't expect them to introduce a completely new issue. Could this be due to some incorrect clutch fluid topped up during the service? Or could it be due to anything else that they screwed up while servicing? Will update here on how it goes after giving it to service center on Monday. Given my experience dealing with these people to get those initial Kushaq niggles fixed (door rattling noise, dashboard creaking noise etc), I seriously doubt they'll fix it sooner, but fingers crossed.", 10th December 2023,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore,8,30,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

3404, Auto_guy_101 , 20:17 ,BHPian,"Here's a minor update on my Kushaq 1.5 DSG: 42 days of ownership and I'm just under 2000 kms. The 1st 1500 kms felt like an adjustment period - both for me (feathering the a-pedal) and the car (some coarse engine sounds). Now the vehicle feels butter smooth and there is plenty of power on tap. I'd like to share a few observations too 1. The audio system with sub-woofer sounds amazing. I've tried all kinds of music on it through carplay/ android auto and it works really well. 2. I have the 10-inch screen and android auto generally stays connected (although any notification triggers a lower volume to the music). Carplay is another story though - disconnections and music starting to play even though its been paused. 3. The electric seats are great. Yet somehow, I find the position of my leg when on the brake to be too upright during long drives. May take some time for me to find that sweet spot. 4. I don't have a PPF. Wanted to get a ceramic coat done, but will probably have to wait (the way I understood - either of these will help keep the car clean, make it easy to clean off bird poop/ dirt, and offer some level of protection against minor scratches). Unfortunately, in my couple highway long distance runs, there is a stone chip (noticeable on close inspection) and a couple small flying stones have made a minor mark on the glass. 5. Mileage: (A/c was almost always on) Highway with CC at 80-95, light throttle, low traffic: 17.5 kmpl Long drive with highway + city (heavy traffic) and quite spirited overtaking/ acceleration (speed always under 110): 15 kmpl - pretty decent Pure city: ~7 kmpl for short runs, ~10-11 kmpl for longer run but drops to 7-8 with frequent stops and heavy traffic - not great, but you can't have the cake and eat it", 11th December 2023,skoda-kushaq,Ernakulam,88,103,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

Please check the technical stuff threads as they may need to check the clutch assembly master cylinder. Please let us know the diagnosis. It is always scary to visit the service centre as they may create issues with a perfectly running car. Finally got my car back today(Dec 13th). And yes, like you rightly pointed out, it was issue with the master cylinder. They have replaced it and the issue seem to be resolved now. But what caused this to suddenly fail after second service is still a mystery. -- Ordeal of service center visit TLDR: They fixed the clutch issue taking 2.5 days, but this time, they stole my dashcam's SD card - Dec 11: Visited service center to drop off my car like I had discussed with the service advisor. He took the car keys and said he'll call me the next day after fixing the issue. When I asked for the job card, he was very reluctant to give the job card and he kept insisting for the job card. He started giving new reasons every 5 mins that his system is not working properly, that the server is down, his system has to be restarted, none of which seemed believable considering other service advisors were generating the job cards for other customers right next to him. On too much of my insistence, he came back to the desk, filled the check-in sheet(where they note down the odometer reading, complaint, scratches etc) and gave me a copy of it. I denied and asked for the proper job sheet. He again started denying and roamed around. After too much of reluctance and making me wait for 30 minutes, he finally decided to create a job sheet and gave it to me. Not very sure about the motive behind his reluctance Dec 12: At 10:30, I called the service advisor to check the status since he hadn't given me any update. This time he mentioned, they are still working on it and it would take more time. He mentioned they need to check the clutch master cylinder and for that they need to open the gearbox(Not sure if it was genuine because atleast as per multiple online sources I checked, no one mentioned about removal of gearbox etc for master cylinder replacement. However for slave cylinder, there was a mention of slave cylinder being inside of the transmission in some cases). I still agreed to him since I'm not an expert in this area. At 12:15, he calls me back and he started asking from where I got my foot mat. And he suddenly started blaming that the foot mat has caused the problem by obstructing the clutch everytime it's pressed and so on. But this definitely was fake because I clearly know the foot mat I'm using doesn't cause any obstruction and there is atleast 0.5-0.75cm of gap between the clutch pedal(when fully pressed) and the mat. I blatantly denied his claims and he started mentioned not to use these unauthorised mats and they have sent the video to the Skoda team and they have also warned about not using those mats which might not cover this kind of repairs under warranty etc. But later he mentioned this time, he'll get it done in the warranty this time and he'll deliver the car the next day At around 4:30, got a call from Skoda customer care. Context: I had replied to one of the tweets where one more person had mentioned about the same issue on his Kushaq and he had to visit the same service center as mine multiple times and yet his problem was not solved. I hadn't tagged Skoda explicitly in this reply, but still customer care called me to enquire. I mentioned the what had happened, and asked them not to raise the complaint to avoid conflict with the service center people. But still the customer care person escalated and raised a complaint. At 5:15, I got a call from CRM of the service center. She started asking why I raised the complaint, while I could've directly talked to her or the service manager about the issue. I mentioned the same thing to her that firstly I didn't directly tweet to Skoda and told her that I even had asked customer care person not to raise any complaint since service center was already working on the issue. She still seemed very frustrated and asked me to delete the tweet. Just to not escalate the situation, I even replied to the email from customer care(with service manager and CRM in cc) that I don't want to raise this as a complaint and service center is already working on the issue. Dec 13: I got a message from service advisor that my car would be ready around 4:30pm. Went to the service center around 5pm, and then service advisor started giving me the papers to sign. On insisting that I want to check the car before signing, he took me near the car and asked me to check and left immediately. I checked my car and clutch issue seemed to have been resolved. I started checking if everything else is in place and noticed that they had completely disconnected all the cables to my dashcam(power supply and rear dashcam connector) and even the power socket plug. (context: Everytime I used to drop the car to service center, they used to disconnect the dashboard by removing the power socket plug. This time while dropping the car at service center I had turned off just the dashcam screen, while the dashcam was still on and recording just to see if they'll avoid disconnecting the cam thinking it's already turned off. Was curious to know how they take care of my car while it's in service center) This is when I noticed that the SD card was also missing from dashcam. On enquiring the service advisor, he asked me if I really left it in dashcam. On saying yes, he came to the car and searched around. After searching, he mentioned he'll try getting the CCTV footage checked to find who would've taken it. On insisting him to get it checked while I was there, he again started acting reluctant by saying, it needs to be checked by IT people and it'll take time. Even after I mentioned I can wait, he was not ready to get it checked while I'm there and he asked me to give time until next morning. He started saying if they don't find, he'll pay for the new one from his pocket. This is when I started suspecting they intentionally removed my SD card to cover up something they might have done while thinking the dashcam was off.

3418, KKapadia , 08:32 ,BHPian," Quote: Originally Posted by hrk997 In need of advice. I had to drive my kushaq 1.5 through flooded streets in chennai. I had no power in my phone and didn't realise the gravity of the situation. In any case, i didn't have any options. I drove through 3km and 20 mins thorough heavily inundated streets. The water level was between just touching the front bumper and under the door at its highest point. While driving, at some point the engine started making knocking sounds. The car was not turned off at any point, and i kept my foot on the accelerator throughout. At one point, it was idling in water for a minute. The exhaust was submerged for a good chunk of time. The mileage was 3.5 kmpl after this. The knocking sound stopped only when I turned on the car the next day. However, the next evening, as i turned on the car to run a quick errand, the check engine light was on. I was flustered and drove a short distance. It drove as usual, engine felt a little more loose and vibey. The next day the check engine light disappeared. Two weeks later i took it out on a proper drive for 10km. I don't know if I'm imagining the power loss, but car felt a little slow to respond to my throttle input. Engine vibrations felt slightly more pronounced, idk if I'm imagining that either. I have to do a 400km drive after which i can give for service. But idk how to present this issue to the service centre. I don't want the engine taken apart or anything. I'm 99% sure the car is fine, but knocking sounds during the drive in the rain and the subsequent check engine light turning on for a day and then off have made me quite paranoid. Thoughts on how to go about this? I can totally understand your situation. Sometimes you just have to go even if the roads are flooded. Since the engine never stopped running its relatively safe, you will not have to take apart the engine for anything. Its not hydro locked . But always keep in mind a couple of things before you venture out into the floods. Keep distance from other vehicles so that your car is not hit by the bow wave created by other moving vehicles. Keep watching the water level on other cars body work like the bumpers or the exhaust of the car in front. If the car in front has the exhaust submerged thats probably the case with your car too. Dont idle in such situations as its easy for the engine to stall and water will be sucked in through the exhaust during that process. Always keep the revs a bit high. Enough to engage gear and prevent stalling. In case your engine ingests water from the intake. It will stall and that is the problem when its hydro locked. As long as the intake is above the water level nothing to worry which is in your case. What you have is most likely water affecting one of the sensors or electrical connections after driving through water. Most likely it will evaporate with use. Otherwise you can take it to a service centre with compressed air and just air out whatever electrical connections you can visually see in the engine bay, around the ecu , battery, charging system, fuel system, intake etc, and spray a liberal dose of WD 40. Then take it for a longish drive to heat things up. Most likely everything will come back to normal. If this doesnt solve it only then take it to the dealer. He will run a scan and pinpoint the issue. But doesnt involve engine opening surely. !", 24th December 2023,skoda-kushaq,Mumbai,90,126,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

3448, scala26 , 22:54 ,Newbie,"Hi all, I wanted to share my experience of owning the Kushaq for over an year now. I have driven the car around 16000 km in city traffic of Chandigarh, highways/ expressways of Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan and highways/ MDR's of Himachal Pradesh, the experience has been very good throughout. I am more of a light footed driver and used to drive a Wagonr for close to an year before buying this car. Choosing the correct car Note: Based on interactions with other folks and reviews from renowned Youtube channels, I was more of a fanboy based of VW group so I didn't really checkout other brands at all. I had a special liking for Polo GT TSI mated with 1.2L engine when I had first started looking for a car back in late 2019. I held myself back because the BS VI norms were about to be enforced and I was not a confident driver back then. Then Covid lockdown was enforced and all the plans took a backseat waiting for the things to normalize. Finally in the year 2022, I started to drive our family car (Wagonr 2011 model) frequently and drove enough for an year to become a confident and responsible driver in any terrain. Simultaneously, the VAG twins had started to offer Kushaq and Taigun with two engines in the Indian market. The fuel pump issues were still around in early 2022, so I kept following the news as I wanted to buy one of these cars mated with 1.5L engine. Finally in October 2022, I had made up my mind to go for my own car as the other vehicle was being used by my father and I needed a vehicle for my day to day activities. My choice was very clear to go for 1.5 L variant as it was well within my budget and given that in my day to day routine, I don't have to counter city traffic I could save some money by going for a manual. The two options were fully loaded Kushaq 1.5L Style Variant and a Taigun without sunroof, key less entry and having just two airbags. I was willing to go for Taigun as it's price tag was Rs 1 Lakh less than Kushaq. The VW showroom in Chandigarh somehow didn't entertain me very well and the price quote hardly had any discounts on the other hand, the Skoda showroom in Chandigarh reduced the price of Style variant to less than the VW quote and the deal was done. The Skoda advisor was very helpful and friendly throughout the process and is like a friend till date. One Year Experience I drove close to 14500 km before my first scheduled service and the experience was really good. I travelled to Gurgaon twice, once to Jaipur, 3-4 times to Shimla and Sunder Nagar in Himachal Pradesh and beyond Shimla where the roads are not very wide with varying gradients. Right from cruising at around 120 km/h or driving at around 20 to 25 km/hr at extended stretch the car responded as I wanted it to. Only issue I feel is the long clutch, which is very tiring to operate in bumper to bumper traffic. I haven't faced any major issues related to clutch noise or clutch being stuck to the floor like the ones reported by few other users. My mind is generally trained to follow gear change recommendations of the car, so I do follow them religiously. Talking about the fuel and fuel economy offered by the car. I have used XP95 right from the first day and given that the fuel tank is 50L, all the refuelling done in the car is from one outlet in Chandigarh. Here are the stats for fuel economy which I have got: 1. On highways in Haryana and Rajasthan, it has been around 18.5 to 21 km/l. 2. Particularly for my Jaipur trip, I got 20.3 km/l for the entire journey since refuel back till home. The journey was primarily through NH 152 D and permissible speed limit was 100 km/h. I avoid using the car in unfamiliar cities and prefer to keep it parked in the hotel and use a cab for commute. 3. For Himachal Pradesh trips I generally get the average fuel consumption of 12 - 15 km/l. 4. For my local travel around Chandigarh, the fuel economy is between 9 and 13 km/l based upon traffic. First Service Experience That's where things got very interesting. I went on a working day to the service center and I had the first appointment slot for the day. Given that it was a basic service, I dropped the vehicle and left for some work. In a few hours I got a call from the service advisor saying that there's an issue with the connector pipe and if possible, it would be great to talk in person. When I went back I was shown the below images: As per the service advisor, when the air filter was being replaced and the pipe was being removed, they found it to be in the above condition. My reaction was that I generally don't allow anyone to open the bonnet except myself and it doesn't look like a rat bite but more of a pre existing defect. They acknowledged and ensured that they would help me but the major problem at hand was that this part is out of stock and they need to place an order for it which would take close to 10 days. Till that point, I cannot drive the car . This was 3-4 days prior to Diwali of 2023. I didn't request for a loaner vehicle as I could manage without it and I called the service center back after Diwali. I was told by the service advisor that the part is not available even in the store where they order from and it needs to be ordered from the company from where Skoda sources these parts . But as a sigh of relief, he requested me to come over and collect the car as they have arranged it temporarily from some other vehicle. Kudos to Skoda Chandigarh for helping me out here as I had read Skoda part availability horror stories and I was feeling like being an author for another thread. 15 days after returning the vehicle to me, I got a call that the part has arrived and if I could come back and get it fitted into the car. I was denied the warranty claim for it as it would take time and the surety of getting it was subjective given the component comes under wear and tear part category. The cost of the pipe was around Rs 1000/- but as a courtesy I was offered a coupon for wheel alignment and balancing which I readily accepted. Insurance claim experience Recently in the month of December, my car was hit by truck on the rear door panel of the driver side. It created a dent and a minor paint crack in the panel at the seat side when the door opens. My bumper to bumper insurance was done from the showroom itself and the claim process was cashless.

I've taken my previous petrol MT car on some hills but it was mostly not spirited driving. I have used my Kushaq on ghat sections of highways like the roads near Krishnagiri on the TN-Blr highway, but the gearbox does its job automatically here. Now I'm planning a few trips to areas like Wayanad. I seek advice on some of the following scenarios: 1. Had to stop on an uphill section and start: For steep climbs in an MT, some clutch control and handbrake does the job, but the climb needs to be done in 1st till the slope levels a bit (my exp). The DSG has hill hold and creeps up with slight throttle, but should I switch to M? Otherwise it will rev to 2700 rpm on D1 and upshift I guess. 2. Taking manual control on DSG at low speeds: in start stop traffic or apartment roads riddled with speed breakers, I've tried shifting to M1 from D2. However, the car just auto shifts to D1 when you break a bit. Should I use the gear lever to move to M? Should I be concerned? 3. Taking hairpins: Normally in an MT, its best to take them in 2nd gear with slightly high revs so you have the power to go up. Whats the best way with DSG?

I'm going to be driving on hills after almost 5 years and seeing the posts about the torquey 1.5 TSI, I think I'm going to enjoy it. Thanks in advance for the tips. 1) I take this road regularly as well as multiple other Ghats and wouldn't fret too much thinking about this. I just let the AT do its job, the D1 in the DSG is pretty short geared and for most moderate ghat climbs(like Wayanad that you suggested), it will shift to D2 and continue in D2 without any strain. One issue with shifting to M1 is that you might forget about this sometimes and might realise this only when the engine booms, since you have suggested that you haven't driven in ghats for a long time, I personally it would again be better to concentrate solely on the road and not let these other things distract you. The cars are designed to handle it. P.S if there is a lot of stop and go traffic (which sometimes happens in Wayanad), do consider shifting the gear to N or P as prefered and using the handbrake, instead of trying to fill every inch of gap that opens up. This greatly reduces DSG strain and reduces heating up chances. The only time at which i take manual control is when I want to have some fun and be aggressive in the corners. Or when I know the next corner is just around the corner and I know it will have to downshift for the next(this again I do very rarely). 2) Here again, I usually let the car do what it wants, I believe you are worried about the clutch strain with too much downshifting and upshifting (I am not knowledgable enough to comment on what is the exact best approach on this, as I have read posts supporting either side). If you really want the car to be kept in gear 1, maybe one thing you can do is to put the Gear in S mode and try M, S in general also holds the gears much longer before shifting and If this is not enough then M1 from S. 3) I would let it be. However if the road permits, I would ideally take it in one smooth go, so that no shifting happens in between, putting it in S helps so that it doesn't upshift too fast. However the gear shifting can get sharper in S for the fellow passengers in S 4) The kushaq engine breaks kind of descent when going downhill and doesn't upshift too fast from my observation, if you are not accelerating, both in D and even more in S. However if this is not enough and you would like for it to go slower, please do use paddle shifters to go the right M gear. Not only does it make the car go down smoother, it will also reduce your need to use the brake and reduce the chance of brake fade. Also as an additional pointer, the issue with Kushaq brakes are its very early bite point, don't worry too much, you will get the hang of it as you keep driving it more. I was also not able to use the brakes that smoothly initially but it grew on me quite well over the time. Hope I was able to help. Don't worry too much and have a wonderful drive. Its a great car, and if you get the Ghat section without much traffic, you will have a blast. Even if you do get traffic in the Ghats, the section after the Ghats are really great(wide roads with the right amount of curves) to explore the insane midrange without having to push.", 6th March 2024,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore/CLT,40,118,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

The experience of a little over two years has been excellent and mostly trouble free. Haven't made any modifications except for the 3M CR70 sunfilm and the aluminum pedals Below are a few points I have observedExcellent on the highway and ghats - 5/5: Most of the 17k driven was on the highway with around 2-3k KMs done within Bangalore city! On highways, it never breaks a sweat, feels planted and is confidence inspiring. On ghats, it feels amazing. If you keep the car at the right RPMs, it is loads of fun to drive. Feels great in the city too because of the light steering. Performance - 5/5: The engine is brilliant. I have felt that it keeps getting better as I drive it more. All smiles while driving this! Service experience has been excellent (5/5) with TAFE Access. Any minor issues faced were promptly and appropriately resolved. Overally, I have not had any major problems Apple Carplay/Android Auto (3/5) - Connectivity has been okay. I prefer using the wired version because it is more reliable Fuel economy has been good (4/5) - On my recently concluded Goa trip, I got a fuel economy of 15.6 KM per litre. One of my trips to coorg, I got a fuel economy of 17.95 KM per litre. Both were measured using the tank-to-tank method. On average, I have seen 8-12 Kmpl in the city and 14-16 kmpl on the highway Comfort (4/5) - Having driven continuously for 11 hours from Goa, I definitely was tired, but not fatigued. Comfort wise it has been great and I feel it should suit most use cases. Of course, it is not as comfortable as the Korean twins Air conditioning is poor (2/5) - Even with 3M CR70 sunfilm installed, the air conditioning is poor in hot conditions. Bangalore has a cool climate and that has helped hide this issue mostly. However, leave it in the sun for too long and you are being cooked on the drive back! Any regrets? - Just one that I didn't get the automatic because that would have made driving in Bangalore traffic bearable. Also, I would have liked the 1.5 TSI, who wouldn't . Other than that no regrets whatsoever! Overall: I am super-happy with my purchase. If I had to buy a car today, it would be the Kushaq again!

I drove Tillari in December last year on my trip between Goa to Belgaum and back. Tillari Ghat is famous for it's steep inclines and hairpin turns with narrow twists. The best method suited to the DSG versions is by shifting the DSG into S mode when climbing and N when descending. Unless you are very comfortable with using the paddle shifters in M mode - it's best to use S mode. The S mode ensures the engine remains in the best gear suited for the full range of revs available. In D mode, steep climbs are just not possible - especially because on most elevated altitudes common to ghats coupled with the incline gradient, it will struggle to climb as the gearbox remains far too low in the rev range. Coming down, the DSG sometimes can get confused in shifting up enough - I've noticed it behaves differently based on the sensing of the incline angle as well .. In steeper descent angles, I found the DSG being unwilling to shift up as a result - with the speed increasing, the revs would shoot up in the lower gear that the DSG would hold. So - found it better to control by shifting into N and using the breaks or manually using the paddle shifts in M mode for the best suited gear. Hope this helps. Might help to practice this if you can somehow.", 9th March 2024,skoda-kushaq,VABB,366,319,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

I believe this part that you suggested, Shifting to N when going downhill is a big No-No, in an automatic transmission, even in manuals this practice is discouraged(although i remember people doing this in the 90s), for the following reasons 1) You are completely giving up engine braking and relying on the brakes, this will heat up the brakes and lead to brake fade, which can be disastrous. 2) Let's say, you do this in a manual and shift to neutral(still not recommended), you at the very least have the option of shifting to the right gear and get the engine braking support, when in need. In an automatic you don't even have this option(Without kiling the gearbox, atleast). Please don't practice the above, it is very risky.

Is it because in the event of brake failure you don't have the benefit of engine braking? I prefer using M in descent .. but depending on the gradient, I alternate with N. What I've found is that the DSG has a hard time in D mode and the revs really shoot up when it remains in low gear and doesn't shift to the correct gear to account for the speed when descending. This I find alarming due to excessively high revs.. and for engine braking I'm concerned it may actually end up damaging the engine.

Too right, the gearbox helps with braking and also provide power in case you need to accelerate out of a situation (you might find a lumbering truck bearing down on you).

I'm no expert, but since I'd asked for advice on DSG tricks for the hills and just returned from a trip to the Ghats, I noticed a rather strange DSG behaviour: When doing downhill on areas like the Wayanad hairpins, the DSG remains fine in D and doesn't really gain speed.

If you were a fighter pilot, I would give you some slack on the alertness factor. . You think I step on the gas in a descent? You clearly haven't understood what I meant. Let me clarify, when in D mode the DSG doesn't shift up sufficiently to account for the increase in speed, meaning it holds a lower than ideal gear (low gear high revs) while letting the engine revs climb well into the red zone.. this is where it gets concerning (and really loud too) and you can hear the engine literally through the cabin in its overrev state for the gear it is in. Secondly, again, I think you picture me as speeding through the descent. I can only assure you I don't, and I'm certainly not fast enough to be burning the brakes. I'm well aware of the need for engine braking, but like I said, I alternate based on my experience, skills and assessment of my conditions between N and M. Even in M, if one isn't adept enough to keep shifting in the right rev range the DSG takes over and shifts to the lower gear to prevent the revs from falling too low in the M mode.. this I've found to be confusing at times as it isn't easy to judge exactly how low you can let the revs drop when in M mode before the DSG logic kicks in. That's the best I can explain what I mean. But if this still doesn't make sense to what I'm trying to explain, well tough luck.. guess I should apply to TopGun academy.

Just to add to the advice given already, you are supposed to stay in a low gear while going downhill and use the brakes carefully when needed. It is normal that you will be at higher revs than normal. From the UK Driving Theory Test: Quote: Q: Youre about to go down a steep hill. What should you do to control the speed of your vehicle? A: Select a low gear and use the brakes carefully Have a look at this website which explains further: https://theorytest.org.uk/youre-abou...-your-vehicle/ Quote: Driving on Steep Hills On a steep hill, your vehicle will have a tendency to speed up. If you stay in the highest gear the car will also be able to go faster and you wont benefit from engine braking. The combination of going faster and not engine braking means it will be both harder to stop and more stressful on your vehicles brakes. You should use a lower gear in combination with careful use of your brakes to ensure you stay at a safe speed. Why do you need to choose a low gear? Lower gears will slow you down quicker and allow you to benefit from engine braking. Without revs, your engine will be resistant to turn. The lower the gear, the more resistance will be created by the engine. When going down hill, this can be beneficial for your brake pads as it reduces the strain they are put under to keep your speed under control on a steep hill. The car will likely jolt if you move down too quickly through the gears. Be sure to use the benefits of engine braking gradually so that you stay in control.

It was a 2-month-old car (about 3k run) which I was able to get for a mouthwatering price in an auction. During the purchase, I thoroughly ensured it was a non-accidental vehicle and even was able to get a purchase inspection done by Zekardo. Even though it was the first time for them to take on a technically used car, they obliged and even the inspection guy was very friendly explaining as he was going through his checks. The report came out clean, apart from a couple of scratches on the door and tyre life at 85%. He mentioned it's common for new cars to be at 80-90% and not a full 100%. Another interesting fact he had shared was to check the sidewalls, if the car was used on rough roads then the markings are likely to be scuffed. After all this, brought the car home with complete peace of mind by 1st week of Dec. The last 3 months were a blast driving the car right from Mumbai to Hyderabad then Vijaywada & couple of trips to Pune and Shirdi. City efficiency in moderate-peak Mumbai traffic is coming to around 11 kmpl (Dahisar to Goregaon NKP during office hours) and highway runs its 16-18 kmpl depending on the speeds. Ride quality has been excellent and despite the sounds from the suspension in deep potholes, it was never jarring. Problem: For the last couple of weeks I have been getting a low 12V battery warning and the engine was also slow to crank so booked a visit to Mody Skoda Goregaon. Right on the day of the appointment, the car threw an Airbag error and after reaching the service centre the battery gave up and refused to start, talk about timing. The experience was okay but it took them 2 full days for a battery replacement. SA mentioned that a cable (need to check which one) was replaced as there was a campaign from Skoda. Got the metal pedals installed from accessories. While the battery issue was unexpected in under 6 months, it's okay as it was a simple fix and the car was running fine for 2 weeks despite the warnings. There were some squeaks and as recommended on the forum, WD40 for the win. The manual driving experience has been effortless (the other car is an AMT) and it's one of the smoothest ones out there. Oh, and he's called Bheem!", 14th March 2024,skoda-kushaq,BOM,37,91,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Spinny Auctions, people with business registrations can register and bid on cars. Once you have won a bid, a token amount is blocked from your account (5-10k) then if the auction price matches with the owners expectation the deal is done. If you have the highest bid but its much lower than the owners asking price then there a counter offer process between both parties to close the deal. There are also cars with pre decided rates, a close bid should usually be enough for the owner to agree to it. After the deal is closed, you can arrange the payment in 5 days and collect the car from the Spinny Hub. Its primarily run for dealers but if you register for personal purchase the process is the same and you will transfer the ownership to yourself.", 15th March 2024,skoda-kushaq,BOM,37,91,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

3477, KKapadia , 06:33 ,BHPian,"Some of the previous comments on using the DSG gearbox is down right worrying in regards to the safety of the occupants and for the life of the gear box. No engineer here but just from couple of years experience. The DSG is just another version of an automatic transmission. For all automatics there are some simple ways to drive which should include the following 1) The selector as a rule should not be touched while the car is in motion. D or R to be only selected while the car is at a complete stop with your foot on the brakes. DSGs come with internal locks which engage and disengage the moment you step on the brakes while tye car is stationary. If you shift to N and D while in motion the gearbox will eventually fail prematurely and we will get another review about a DSG failure 2) The selector can be moved to a sports mode if your car has such a thing. In that case you could change gears using the selector while the car is in motion. But very importantly you can only shift from D to S/M and vice versa never to N or any other slot unless the car is stationery. 3) Hand brake is a big No, to be engaged only when the car is parked. What you see on WRC is a totally different game not applicable to normal road cars 4) Major worry here is that the engine Revs rise when going down a steep descent. Yes any decent gearbox is designed to do that. Gearing gives the much needed control over momentum of your vehicle. The key is you let the revs rise while driving downhill. You are not burning more fuel. Fuel supply is cut off since your foot is not on the gas pedal. You will notice the revs fall once you apply the brakes. So you can actually control the over revving by intermittently using the brakes to control the speed and the revs. So all in all you are splitting the job between the gearbox and the brakes to control your vehicle. Both components are happy. This may sound strange but if the descent is manageable and the DSG is still holding on to a low gear and you want it to upshift just blip the throttle hard for a second it will immediately react and move to the next gear. I hope this helps. Happy motoring.", 17th March 2024,skoda-kushaq,Mumbai,90,126,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

VAG MQB IN2.0 cars have a very well known issue of having abysmally underperforming A.C's (not fully suitable for Indian conditions). Sunfilms (however premium and high performance) can only supplement existing performance of the A.C., by a slight margin and not boost an already weak/underspec'd compressor.", 17th March 2024,skoda-kushaq,Bombay,49,125,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

Not strange, dangerous. 'Blip the throttle hard for a second' in a lower gear, going downhill, will both make the car lunge - and even assuming it achieves the desired upshift - will make the car roll faster (lesser engine braking in higher gear) and necessitate using the brakes to reduce speed again. True even on a mild gradient, gravity works just the same. Stomping the go pedal going downhill belongs in the same no-no list as coasting in neutral going downhill.", 17th March 2024,skoda-kushaq,Bangalore,"5,802","23,834",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Positive

It is the car's AC which is the issue. My friend's i20 feels significantly cooler and quieter when compared to my Kushaq.
