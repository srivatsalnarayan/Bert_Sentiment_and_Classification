0, rahul_goyal , 18:23 ,BHPian,"Dear fellow BHPians, Team-BHP has been a great platform for us car lovers/enthusiast and being an avid reader myself, I know how helpful can these initial ownership report be for the potential buyers. So here I am, sharing my initial ownership report of Grand i10 Nios on the forum. We got Grand i10 Nios Sportz AMT (Titan Grey) in our family on September 8, 2019. The main requirement here was to get a small automatic petrol hatchback on a strict budget of under 8 lakh rupees and after considering various options, we narrowed down to Nios for being best AMT option in this segment. Having owned an Xcent in the past, which we all know is basically Nios's predecessor with the boot, I can well relate to the upgrades that Hyundai has brought into the segment. LikesSmooth 1.2 Kappa Engine (BS6 compliant) Great visibility from driving seat Low window line gives a good sense of space Interiors and cabin fit/finish 8 inch infotainment unit Digital speedometer and MID is a neat touch DRVM Projector Headlamp and Boomerang shaped DRL Rear seat space and bench cushioning Smooth AMT gear box DislikesFront seats are not as comfortable as the rear seats Push start/stop button and door request sensor are not on offer on an 8 lakh rupee car (AMT is only offered in Magna and Sportz; top of the line Asta variant is only available with MT) Stiffer suspension (not really a bad thing as it helps in handling, but then the car really doesn't swallow the potholes as you would expect) Shut lines are on the thicker side Grey seats are prone to get soiled (so does beige though) Boot space is nothing to write about No auto-dimming IRVM Fixed type headrest for front seats No leather wrapped steering wheel in Sportz variant Research and Booking The alternatives considered were:Tata Tiago - Dropped after reading reports of issue with AMT; Honda Jazz, Maruti Baleno/Toyota Glanza, - Dropped as the on-road price for CVT was going out of budget; None of the car dealers offered any substantial discount to make it an interesting proposition; (Despite all the slow down news in auto industry, I didn't get any lucrative offer) Honda Brio - Had to drop as it is no longer in production Honda Amaze - This one is actually well priced for what it offers (better priced than Jazz, IMO), but got dropped as the requirement was hatchback and not a sub 4 meter sedan. Also, the auto version was going out of budget. Grand i10 - Older generation had good offers because Nios was about to be launched, but FE is a concern with automatic and buying an older generation when new one is almost there just didn't feel right. Hence, dropped. Why Grand i10 Nios? Well, I was actually waiting for the next generation Grand i10 to arrive and we did hold off the buying decision until the news on arrival of Nios became official. In the meanwhile, I read up all about the Grand i10 1.2 Kappa motor and gathered that it is good reliable motor. But, I also read the stories of Grand i10 automatic being a guzzler. Soon more leaks came in and it was confirmed that next gen grand i10 will arrive with AMT. Having read the Santro's AMT official review on Team-BHP and all the appreciation this AMT received overall, I knew that Hyundai's AMT is as good as it can get when it comes to AMTs. I also remember reading somewhere that a bigger engine would work better with AMT. In my head, I started absorbing all this information about next gen Grand i10 retaining its engine (Petrol becoming cleaner - read BS6) and the AMT being on offer (which should take care of the FE). 'So what can go wrong here?' I thought and the answer I got was barring the price 'Nothing'. We booked the Grand i10 Nios Titan Grey before the launch at Himgiri Hyundai, Gurgaon by paying a token amount of INR 11000/-. We also got a written confirmation for 100% refund in case of cancellation. While we were there, I decided to test drive the Santro AMT, just to have an idea of AMT operation and its smoothness. Having read good reviews, I had a little higher expectation of AMT and it didn't blow me away, but it was good when driven on a light foot. But booking was done, and now I could just hope that Nios will be better and smoother to drive. Dealer promised delivery in the first week of September. The Global Launch August 20 - the Grand i10 Nios was officially launched. Variant list was leaked before the launch, so AMT not being on offer on top variant was not a surprise. Sportz AMT was launched at the ex-showroom price of INR 6.98 lakhs. Pricing was good, although I was a little disappointed for missing out on some features that Asta had, but having an automatic was more important and this was in budget. Test Drive and Pre-Delivery Inspection Went to see the car in the showroom and test drove the MT as the AMT was not available for test drive. I was impressed with the interior quality, space and driving dynamics of the car. Sadly, the AMT was never offered for test drive, but the dealer did deliver on its promise of early delivery. Car came to the dealer on 4th September and I requested to carry out the pre-delivery inspection. Bigger concern was the titan grey colour and how it looked in flesh. I saw her for the first time on the evening of 5th September and immediately fell in love with the colour. It was beautifully complimented by the 14'' inch Gun Metal alloys and looked extremely sexy. I don't think any other colour is as well matched with these gun metal alloys as the Titan Grey does. Showroom Experience The sales advisors at Himgiri Hyundai are not well trained. My sales representative didn't know anything about the first in segment variable warranty on offer. Even when I mentioned that this is a first in segment feature where customer can choose the warranty package they want with Nios, he looked at me weirdly and said standard warranty is for 3 years and you can purchase extended warranty by paying extra. I showed him the variable warranty option mentioned on Hyundai India website. He got back to me next day and said that the customer needs to opt for one of the warranty package at the time of delivery. Variable Warranty Options3 years / 100000 kms 4 years / 50000 kms 5 years / 40000 kms He further confirmed that extended warranty option will not be available if you opt for basic warranty of 4 years/ 50000 kms or 5 years / 40000 kms. They were also not informed of extended warranty price and tried to get their way out of the conversation by saying that Hyundai has not released the extended warranty prices. He went on claiming that extended warranty price hasn't even come for Venue yet, so we'll have to wait for Nios's extended warranty and it should not concern us because we have 90 days from the date of purchase. Hyundai India updates the extended warranty price on its website soon after the launch. I checked it myself and sent the pdf file to the SA, he had no reaction/answer. I told him that we will be opting for 3 year / 100000 kms basic warranty and will be taking extended warranty for the 4th and 5th year / 120k kms additionally. Price for this extended warranty was INR 8960/- (INR 7590 + 18% GST). Day before the D-day Himgiri insited to take loan and insurance from their inhouse teams and the SA went on to the extent of telling me that it is mandatory for me to take atleast one of these two from Himgiri. ""Is it the law?"" I asked smilingly and he understood that I wasn't gonna let him take me for a ride. However, I did take the insurance from Himgiri because for almost same premium, I was getting few added benefits such as personal belonging cover and key cover etc. Paid INR 30,800/- for Bharti Axa General Insurance. Their finance team called separately and did offer the same quote as I was getting at HDFC, but I decided to stick with my banker and politely refused. However, they were not happy and told me that bank loan transfer can cause troubles for me on the delivery date, as there can be instances of money not being reflected in Himgiri's account and if I take it from their inhouse team no such issue will arise. And that is exactly what happened, it just felt like a vendetta on customers for not opting for things from the dealers' inhouse team. A day before the delivery, they created a scenario where my banker confirmed that payment has been made, but the SA kept on saying that since the payment has not hit our account yet and we cannot give delivery on Sunday as promised. All communication with respect to payment were shown, emails were sent out to Himgiri by HDFC team and the SA even accepted that he knows payment has been confirmed, but kept on insisting that payment must reflect in our account to give delivery. After much debate and frustration, the SA said that he will take approval from the Manager and deliver the car tomorrow. He also told me that he was making this exception and this is not their standard practice, I somehow refuse to believe this. IMO, it is just a ploy to unnecessarily harass the customers. Delivery Reached the showroom at noon and saw the car being ready for delivery. I proceeded to finish the formalities. The on-road price break up is as under:- Ex-showroom price - INR 6,98,350/- Handling Charges - INR 3,000/- (Will be writing a letter for refund of this amount after receipt of the RC) Registration (RTO) - INR 57,900/- Insurance (0 Dep.) - INR 30,800/- Extended Warranty - INR 8,960/- Mudflaps and Mats - INR 1,500/- Total - INR 8,00,510/-Himgiri didn't fail in disappointing me further. The car ran out of fuel and engine turned itself off while the SA was giving the demo on the car. I was charged INR 1500/- for mats and mudflaps, but the mats given were standard rubber type mats (not specifically designed to fit floor of Grand i10 Nios). On being confronted, they accepted that these are not car specific but generic mats and will be replaced when the official accessories for Nios arrive at their dealership. Car wasn't spic and span and no freebies were offered. Not even a pouch that you get for keeping manual and service booklet. A not so good cake and a bunch of 3 almost dead flowers was presented. IMHO, I think its time for the dealership model to go away, manufacturers should just follow Tesla's footstep and set up experience centres for customers. If the customer decides to go with the car, he/she can just place the order online and get the car delivered at its door step. Anyway, the car was finally ours with 40 odd kms on the odometer and it looked amazing. We took off from the showroom and went on to a short drive for celebratory lunch.", 24th September 2019,hyundai-grand-i10,Gurugram,138,857
1, rahul_goyal , 16:39 ,BHPian,"Exteriors From the front car looks bigger. The grill is very wide and holds boomerang shaped DRLs that look neat. Rear is very similar to Tiago (tail lamps are identical). Side profile is attractive and Nios has decent ground clearance for its segment. Interiors Best fit and finish in the segment, as expected from Hyundai. The car gets honeycomb pattern design on door pad, on space above glove box and on the moulding around gear shifter. Interiors carry a theme in ivory grey color and to be honest I didn't really like it when I saw it in pictures. But it looked much better in flesh. I wish they provided leather wrapped steering wheel in sportz variant. Rear seat is a comfortable space to be in as the bench provides great cushioning and there is acres of leg space (even with taller passenger at front). Recline angle helps in increasing the comfort. Front seats are decent, but I wish they were thicker and had more cushioning. Safety and Security The car gets 2 airbags, ABS, emergency stop signal (on emergency braking, the hazard lights flash to alert the car in the rear) and speed alert system (a beep is heard when you hit 80 km/h and 100 km/h). Kilometres completed and average use So far the car has completed 750+ kms. First free service is due at 1200-1500 kms or 2 months, whichever is earlier. I expect monthly usage of 1500-1800 kms. Infotainment and MID 8 inch infotainment unit comes with Arkamys premium sound mood and lets you connect to more than one phone at a time (I tested with two phones). Only one phone at a time can be connected for making/receiving calls over bluetooth. Sound output is good and an average user will not complain. Android Auto and Apple car play is supported as well. Reverse camera turns on automatically when the car is shifted to R and gives wide view of the space/things at the rear. Seat fabric quality is good but the grey colour is prone to get soiled. I will go with dry cleaning in future and haven't planned to install any seat covers as of now. MID is updated and only has a tachometer dial, rest information is digitally displayed (including speedometer). It provides Dual Tripmeter, Distance to Empty, Average Fuel Consumption, Instantaneous Fuel Consumption, Average Vehicle Speed, Elapsed Time (Engine Running). Ergonomics and Storage In typical Hyundai fashion, every thing is where you would expect it to be. USB charging points, controls on ACC, Infotainment Unit and driver side door pad buttons are easily accessible. There's a dedicated space provided to keep your mobile phone (In Asta variant, it provides support for wireless charging). ORVMs are carried forward from previous generation and are of the right size. Support for electric adjustment and power folding is present in ORVMs. Steering can be adjusted for height (Tilt), telescoping function is given a miss. All doors can hold 1 litre bottles and boot space is adequate. Rear seat arm rest is not provided. Driver's side window gets one touch down feature. Air Conditioning Automatic climate control does a decent job in cooling the cabin. I usually keep the temperature at 22 degrees and found it to be just right to my liking. Air flow from the front vents is good but it the the rear AC vent that really left me impressed. How is it like to drive? One word answer, smooth. I have been driving turbo diesels for more than 10 years and am so used to the engine vibration that I ended up cranking the already on engine a few times. It is that silent. Slot the car into D, lift your foot off the brake pedal and a split second later, the car starts crawling at the maximum speed of 9 km/h. People stuck in bumper to bumper traffic everyday would appreciate this feature. Ride quality is good and the suspension has become stiffer when compared to the last generation. Finding a comfortable seating position is not an issue and with seat height set up high, you get a very good commanding view of the road in front. NVH levels are good but I felt cabin insulation was better in my Xcent. Brake bite point is just the right amount, no complaints here. Steering weighs up nicely at higher speeds and car cruises between 75-80 km/h in 5th gear with minimum effort. Ride feels planted and Hyundai's handling at high speeds is getting better with every car and Nios doesn't disappoint either. Projector headlamps provides adequate light for night driving; high beam is strong too. Visibility and sense of space from driver's seat is the best I have witnessed in this segment. How jerky is the AMT? Let's get the elephant out of the room, the AMT on Grand i10 Nios felt much better than the one I drove with Santro. That being said, the jerkiness and head nod (typically associated with AMTs) would depend on how the car is accelerated. On a light foot, I didn't feel any jerkiness or head nod. While the upshifts to 2nd/3rd gear can be felt, the upshifts to 4th and 5th gear are barely noticeable. Downshifts are not felt at all. When driven with a heavier foot, the AMT delays the upshift giving you a wider powerband and gear changes become noticeable with a slight head nod. The car is best enjoyed when driven in a relaxed manner. Letting your foot off the accelerator for AMT to upshift doesn't work. The AMT shifts on the basis of rpm and force applied on the accelerator pedal. To have a complete seamless experience, one can slot into M (Manual Mode) and upshift as required. Driving in manual mode gives you best of both worlds, as you don't have to deal with clutch and you get more control with upshifts. Downshifts are automatic even on manual mode and too early upshifts (where rpm is not high enough) are ignored by the AMT gearbox, it is only when you reach an optimum rpm, the AMT lets you upshift. IMO, this is the best AMT available right now and makes Grand i10 Nios, a breeze to drive. Fuel Efficiency On a tankful to tankful method, the car returned an average of 11.55 kmpl for the first 335 kms (with city usage and AC on at all times), the MID showed 12.5 kmpl. For the next 353 kms, the car returned a fuel economy of 12.74 kmpl on tankful to tankful method. The MID showed 13.7 kmpl. Some significant thingsUnlocking the front passenger door no longer unlocks the whole car; Doors auto-lock when car reaches the speed of 15 km/h; Doors unlock when the key is taken out; Boomerang DRLs are connected with handbrake and turns on automatically when handbrake is released; Pressing the brake is mandatory before making any shift on gear lever (car beeps and a warning comes up on the instrument cluster); More than one phone can be connected with the infotainment to play music; Only one phone at a time can be connected for making/receiving calls; Car honks once on locking via remote and twice on unlock; (There's no way to stop it from honking and horn is very loud, while locking one can lock the car from the lock button on the door and shut the door = no honking, but do not forget to leave the key inside) Infotainment keeps on playing music even when key is taken out (tested for over 2 minutes); it turns off as soon as the door is opened. Holding the reset button on MID over 'Distance to Empty' changes the temperature reading for MID and ACC from celsius to fahrenheit and vice versa Previous generation had this feature where if you unlock the car, open a door and put stuff in the car and shut the door - the car would lock automatically after a minute. This is a nifty feature which really helps in case someone forgets to lock the car. For some reason, this has been given a miss in Nios. Planned upgradesCeramic Coating at Detailing Devils, Sohna Road - Quoted price INR 15,000/- for 3 years with annual touch up; Door guard on all 4 doors (already purchased from Amazon) - will get them installed after ceramic coating; Anti rust coating (underbody protection) with 5 year warranty from 3M - Quoted Price INR 4800/- with half yearly inspection and touch up; Noodle mats (cut from a roll according to floor size), if I replace the standard rubber mats with official Nios fabric mats; While I am keen on ceramic coating, I have mixed feeling about anti rust coating. I have gone through the forum, but didn't quite make up my mind on the necessity of going for antirust coat. I read that it's not required in Delhi NCR. Say if the underbody does get rusted, isn't that covered in your warranty? I welcome opinions of senior members and experts, to advice me on noodle mats vendor in Gurgaon, anti rust coating and ceramic coating.", 25th September 2019,hyundai-grand-i10,Gurugram,138,857

3, rahul_goyal , 01:41 ,BHPian,"Features of AMT as explained in the Owner's Manual Quote: The Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) can be thought of as a automatically shifting manual transmission. It gives the driving feel of a manual transmission. When D (Drive) is selected, the transmission will automatically shift through the gears similar to a conventional automatic transmission. Unlike a traditional automatic transmission, the gear shifting can sometimes be felt and heard as the actuators engage the clutches and the gears are selected. When the gear is shifting, you may sometimes hear operating noise. This is normal and does not indicate a problem with your transmission. The Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) adopts a dry-type single clutch, which is different from the torque converter of the automatic transmission. It shows better acceleration performance and increased fuel efficiency while driving but initial launch might be little bit slower than the automatic transmission. As a result, gear shifts are sometimes more noticeable than a conventional automatic transmission and a light vibration during launching can be felt as the transmission speed is matched with the engine speed. This is a normal condition of the Automated Manual Transmission (AMT). The dry-type clutch transfers torque more directly and provides a direct drive feeling which may feel different from a conventional automatic transmission with a torque converter. This may be more noticeable when launching the vehicle from a stop or when traveling at low, stop-and-go vehicle speeds. When rapidly accelerating at a low vehicle speed, the engine rpm may increase highly depending on the vehicle’s driving condition. For a smooth launch uphill, depress the accelerator pedal smoothly depending on the current conditions. If you release your foot from the accelerator pedal at low vehicle speed, you may feel engine braking, which is similar to manual transmission. When you turn the engine on and off, you may hear clicking sounds as the system goes through a selftest. This is a normal sound for the Automated Manual Transmission (AMT). During the first 1,500 km (1,000 miles), you may feel that the vehicle may not be smooth when accelerating at low speed. During this break-in period, the shift quality and performance of your new vehicle is continuously optimized. Creeping Function Quote: The Creeping function helps the vehicle to start smoothly. If you take your foot off the brake pedal when the shift lever is either in R (Reverse), D (Drive) or M (Manual) position, the vehicle will start slowly without depressing the accelerator pedal. To disable the function, depress the brake pedal or pull up the parking brake lever. The creeping function will not operate when the parking brake lever is engaged with the shift lever in R (Reverse), D (Drive) or M (Manual) position.

9, peterjim13 , 16:46 ,BHPian,I really loved the overall looks of the car and the alloy wheel is quite complimenting.

10, praveen_v , 16:46 ,BHPian,Congratulations on the new car. I am also looking at a Nios AMT and the same color as well and the experience from a user perspective is really helpful for someone like me looking to take the plunge. I am looking to move from a Jazz CVT to the Nios AMT (Due to various reasons) and was worried a bit regarding the AT experience and the efficiency. I drive with a light foot and based on your experience and my test drive I think i should be able to adapt quickly without feeling like a too much of a downgrade. Hyundai's AMT is based on electric actuators (Quicker and smoother?) compared to hydraulic actuators in other AMT boxes and as per tbhp review of Hyundai's AMT it seems to be the best implementation as far as AMTs are concerned. FE also seems to be on par with the Jazz CVT under city condition. I feel that the interior space is almost at par with the Jazz and the rear bench has more depth and comfortable with ample leg room. The boot is much smaller though and expected due to its dimensions. Hyundai has again short-changed by not giving the AMT option on the top end but at least they have not skimped too much in the sportz variant compared to other models in Hyundai lineup. Do keep updating the mods/accessories when you add and again wishing you a great time with the car., 27th September 2019,hyundai-grand-i10,Chennai,505,206
11, forester , 16:55 ,BHPian,"Many congratulations on a lovely looking car there and a tasteful choice of colour. Wish you many miles of blissful ownership! According to this report - https://www.autocarpro.in/news-natio...says-iza-44162 - it's alarming how carmakers in India cut corners and skimp on the basic galvanisation (anti-corrosion) process for their domestic models to save costs. The report also suggests that with increasing use of High Strength Steel, it is even more important to galvanise the BIW to avoid rusting of this comparatively thinner sheet metal. Now, if Hyundai hasn't gone ahead and treated the NIOS, whose body is comprised of 65% Advanced and High SS, you are better off getting it coated from a reputable service provider.

Wishing you many many happy miles with the car. Ceramic coating is probably an overkill on a new car. A basic paint sealant treatment should be sufficient. You could probably do the ceramic coating after a year or two when you feel like doing something for the car to make it look fresh. For anti-rust coating, read your owners manual. Some mfg. clearly mention the duration for which warranty is applicable for rusting. Example: VW states clearly for Polo, Vento, Ameo it is 6 years anti-rust warranty while for Jetta, Passat and Tiguan it is 12 years. Something similar should be mentioned in the owners manual of the Nios too. One thing I have noticed is that due to the thinner sheet metal on Maruti cars, going for the anti-rust protection from 3M for the underbody helps reduce the road noise to a good extent. If not for anything else, you can get it done for this benefit. ", 27th September 2019,hyundai-grand-i10,Bangalore,"2,769","1,266"

As usual they've cut corners too, they remove backlit power-window buttons usually but here they power window button isn't even having the window logo on them, looks like a homage to cars under the 5L barrier, and then the steering wheel control buttons, as a fan of omnibalance designs this looks out of place as far as my car OCD is concerned. Also, no harm in giving adjustable headrests. Congrats, as far as small and efficient is concerned, this takes the cake.. a perfect city oriented, family car with better F.E than torque converters. They have simply whacked it out of the park when it comes to design. I don't think you need to waste money on ceramic coating, just get it washed well and maintained well, save the money for other stuff.

Hyundai may have overpriced the car a bit but it is a BS6 version so if Swift moves on to the same stage, both shall be equally priced. I am not a Hyundai fan at all but perspectives are changing. Especially with designs and features, Hyundai is much better than any other brand in the country now. (Subjective) Things I don't like about them: Brakes - They have a weird hardness to them. Does not inspire confidence. Handling: Poor driving dynamics and light steering. Although post 60 kmph, it weighs in well. ( Is there something one can do to make it better like Fiats or VWs?) Been told a few negatives about them by my Solution Architect who owned the i20. 1. Post 3-4 years Hyundai cars are expensive to maintain 2. There are a lot of electronic (features) which post few years need replacement and are very expensive 3. The paint quality of Hyundai is not very good 4.

Its a pain to use a bare rubber steering if your car is lying baked in the sun for a long time, it also gets sticky after use and its one of the things where you can't get a proper fitting done in the aftermarket.

However, his main concern was pre-delivery inspection photo of the car, that I have added in the first post. He said that the car had dirt marks on the doors and that didn't go down well with Hyundai team. I told him that in my review, I have specifically mentioned that the picture was taken on pre-delivery inspection. I also told him that at the time of delivery, I wasn't happy with the cleanliness of the car from inside and the same is mentioned in the review itself. His other concern was the feedback on lack of variable warranty information, but then he explained himself by saying that its justified as the car is new and SAs were not trained. Couple of days later, I visited the showroom for getting the HSRP installed and to replace the rubber mats with official Nios carpet mats. They also gave me the service book cover. Himgiri team asked me to sign a form which stated that I had some concerns with the showroom, but the same has now been rectified to my satisfaction. I politely declined to sign any form as I stand by my concerns and feedback posted in my review. The car has completed approx 1200 kms and is due for its first service. I plan to get the service done this Saturday and will share an update. Some pictures of the mats and door guard I just installed are attached below.

Grand i10 is a great car for city usage and the only issue I had with previous AT model was the dismal FE & lack of basic features like rear wash/wipe.

During my search(6 months back) one of the reasons for going for Jazz over i20 was the rear space which is better than compact-sedans & some subcompact-SUVs as well. I think I didnt quite put that clearly. The width is definitely lesser which means 3 people at the rear is going to be a tighter fit. The intrusion of the rear AC vent will also make it bit more difficult the person seated in the middle. What I wanted to mention was the rear seat leg space which is very good. I dont think anyone will complain of legspace at the rear. The rear bench is also much deeper and reclined which offers a comfortable seating position. Also the color scheme helps a lot in making the cabin very airy. The Grey-White theme makes it much brighter than even the beige. The nios is slightly longer and wider than the grandi10 which puts it closer to i20 in terms of rear legroom. You can see the max/min legspace photo in rahul's photo in this thread.

First service is pretty basic with car inspection followed by washing/cleaning. Estimated time given for service was 2 hours. I reached the service centre early at 9:40 AM to avoid Saturday rush and decided to wait. After couple of hours, when I went to see the car they were still cleaning the car and were doing a sloppy job. I could see the water marks everywhere. I clean my cars every morning and do a better job than these guys. Anyway washing wasn't a really big concern but then I found this on the driver's door: A scratch of the size of a rice grain but visible. I called the service advisor immediately who went to see the pictures he took on his tablet. There was no scratch in the picture. Before opening a job card they take extensive pictures and highlight all dents/scratches that they find. The Service advisor apologized and suggested to do a touch up on the scratched part. I asked if it would look good as new? He declined and said it will be visible cause I know its there. The other option was to paint that part in the booth and to make it look as good as new. I was very upset as you do not expect your service centre to put a scratch on a brand new car. I told him I will come tomorrow and decide the way forward. Next day, I went to get the scratched part repainted for which they took an entire day. Promised time was 05:30 PM. I called the service advisor at 5 PM and he asked if I can pick up the car tomorrow. I said tomorrow is Monday and I need the car tomorrow, so I need to pick it up today. He said that I will have to come again next week for polishing as they can't do polishing on fresh painted area. I had no other option. Reached the service centre and checked out the car, but couldn't really make out anything as the car was covered with dust. Got the car delivered at 6:30 PM after waiting for an hour for them to clean the car. The painted area had water like spots which I was told that will get removed on polishing. I went again next week, they took an hour and finished the polishing work. The painted part has a little bluish tint, but only a keen observer would be able to see. All in all, an awful and disappointing experience for a simple first service. They scratched the car and made me revisit their service centre thrice. One of the key consideration for buying a new car is after sales support and service network, but Hyundai is failing in providing a fuss free ownership experience. I guess its the simple case of not caring for customers anymore as they are successful and established now.", 25th October 2019,hyundai-grand-i10,Gurugram,138,857

Petrol was the preferred choice because of following reason:10 year limit on diesel vehicles in NCR reduces the resale value; Running cost difference is not much as the price difference in petrol and diesel in negligible; (MID shows 17+ mostly within city usage; not bad for a petrol car IMO); Ownership cost difference for same variant in diesel is about INR 1 lakh; Diesel is 3 cylinder turbocharged engine and I have driven it extensively in my previous car (Xcent) to know that it can give you fair share of trouble specially owing to the quality of diesel fuel supplied at most petrol pumps in India; Petrol is a cleaner fuel in comparison to diesel and has lesser environmental impact.

He denied the existence of any such option and told me fourth and fifth year warranty has to be purchased at extra cost. I showed him the Hyundai web page and still he didn't accept. I went ahead with the purchase anyway because the car perfectly fit our requirements. Meanwhile I emailed Hyundai customer relations team asking for a clarification and they just forwarded the mail to popular Hyundai's main dealership office. One lady called me from the Kochi office of popular Hyundai, but she was as clueless as my SA regarding variable basic warranty. She told me the person who handles the warranty matters will contact me but nobody did. About a month later while I was going through the owner's manual I found the page where warranty package chosen has to be marked and stamped by the dealership. I took a picture of the page, send to my SA and demanded him to explain. This time he accepted his mistake, apologized and said he had no idea about it because they didn't get any proper training regarding this Now comes the best part. I asked him to change my warranty plan to 5 years/40000 kms since that's what suits me best. He apologized again and said it cannot be changed now because it has to be done during the billing process. I lost my cool, gave him an earful and then he said he will try to compensate for all this during the services. The whole experience was nothing like I had expected from Hyundai.

Please try flooring the accelerator with your toe and pulling the mat out from under.My accelerator went deeper noticably when I did this so got it cut.

62, Sandeepg33k , 01:16 ,Newbie,"Hi All Hope you all are having a great day. I purchased Gi10 NIOS AMT 2 months back in Bangalore. The car is fantastic and is a great city car. However, I am facing a weird issue. Here are the details. This happens only occasionally (3 out of 10 times). When the speed is around 55KM, the gear automatically shifts to D5. At this point, if I press the accelerator lightly, the speed doesn't increase. Rather I hear a weird engine noise each time I press the accelerator pedal. The steering also vibrates at this point. However, if I hard press the accelerator pedal the gear shifts down to D3 (from D5) and the noise goes away. During the first service (1.5 months back), I told the service center staff about this issue. They drove the car, but couldn't reproduce. Finally, I thought it might be a temporary glitch and moved on. But the issue is still there -- it keeps popping up and is a bit irritating. What should I do? Since it doesn't happen always, how should I convey it effectively at the service center? Any advice will be very helpful. Thanks a lot!", 14th March 2020,hyundai-grand-i10,Bangalore,3,10

For first couple of seconds there's no response from the car (its for safety reason that they have built in the delay) but then suddenly it starts creeping at 7km/h speed, which at times is higher when you are in parking in tight spots.

68, Maverick Avi , 20:37 ,BHPian,"I am currently on the lookout for automatic hatch and was basically looking at Celerio and Wagon R. I have taken multiple test drives of both these vehicles to have a good understanding of AMT behaviour. In the meanwhile my cousin bought Nios Sportz AMT and was highly recommending it. While I was at his place I went for a short drive at night and was impressed by the overall quality and comfort that the car offered. He then offered me to take the car to my office for a day and see if I like it. I readily agreed as my workplace is almost 90 kms run with 70% city and rest highway. Below are some observations based on my drives of all these AMT hatchbacks. 1. Nios no doubt would attract any buyer who would come to a showroom and make a decision based on test drive. It can easily wow a customer looking at Wagon R segment and entice them into paying extra. 2. That cabin is just perfect. The materials, the ergonomics, the view and NVH. All far better than competition. 3. Ride is stiffer than Wagon R. Occasional sharp undulations do get transferred to dashboard and creates unwanted noise in an otherwise silent cabin. Ride comfort is overall better though. 4. I just hate the horn. 5. Most important part. The AMT. It has its own brain. I could not predict precisely when the car would upshift or downshift. With a very light foot it sometimes never shifted to 5th gear even at 55 kmph. Similarly, even with light foot it held to 3rd gear at speeds around 45 kmph. This was never the case with Maruti. Its gear changing felt more precise and predictable. The way gears were behaving in Nios, I would say that the AMT might have occasional issues for some owners in near future. Maruti has sorted this out due to more experience with this technology. The shifts are quite smooth though and most people would not bother at all. 6. The manual mode is designed to not lug the engine I guess. At 48 kmph if I tried to manually upshift from 4th to 5th gear it won't let me do that. At 55 it did. 7. Audio quality is OK. Not great. Better than Wagon R though. 8. Steering feels great to hold. 9. Hyundai seems to have some quality issues lately as mentioned in a separate post. Insulation foam was jutting out from the area where windscreen and dashboard meet. Cousin told me its from day one. It easily cathes the eye so not sure what QC is getting done. Or maybe some work done on dashboard area by dealer. Fishy. Driver side window had screeching/abrasive sound while operating. Nios is a Swift competitor and if I overlook the AMT factor it is a VFM product. This time Hyundai has got the pricing bang on. Nios Magna AMT can be owned for 7.1 lakh on road Delhi with all applicable discounts which is cheaper than Swift Vxi AMT. And Magna has a better feature list list too. A very tempting proposition for me. The only thing I am not convinced about is AMT reliability. Overall a great car to consider in my opinion. ", 29th August 2020,hyundai-grand-i10,New,264,583
69, Shashank.A , 11:46 ,BHPian,"Bought this as a City Juggler and till now it is delivering as promised. Reading the comments I realise that people know about the 7-8kph crawl speed and have some issues with the same but see no mention of the second level of crawl at 17 kph. I was surious if there were any more levels which I am yet to discover. the 8 kph and 17kph crawl speeds makes this such a charm to drive in bumper to bumber traffic conditions. Also initially you might feel that its creeping too fast to 7kph speed - but you get used to handling it. There is the brake paddle for a reason - when you are not using the accelerator, you were supposed to use the brake unless the car is in neutral :P Also I feel the seats are really not comfortable and they do expect us to mount some covers on them to give some cushioning and curves. I am in market looking for some now. Any recommendations are welcome.

There is the brake paddle for a reason - when you are not using the accelerator, you were supposed to use the brake unless the car is in neutral :P I can understand your point of view here but let me elaborate. Problem statement / Use case scenario: I have a corner parking where one side is a wall. The cars in the front are SUVs which jot out from their own slots a bit due to their sizes. Now when I start in the morning, I have to take a three point turn with at least 2 to 3 short forward and reverse movements. Here lies the issue and you are try and simulate this on your car as well. What happens is that as you step off the breaks, initially the car moves slowly but if you lift of completely there is a sudden lurge forward to get to 7 kmph. Now if you lift slowly and keep the breaks half pressed, there are severe vibrations in the car. I was initially very worried but from the reply of others, realized that its just the AMT behaviour and specially during cold starts. If you keep the window down, you will also hear - 'Khat' - 'Khat' sounds for frequent Fwd - Rev gear changes. Well to be honest, on a straight line, Bumper to Bumper traffic your observations are correct and you will not realize this behaviour so much. I feel it more because I sometimes drive my BIL's Amaze CVT and its smooth like butter off the line on cold start. Anyways I am saving all of this for my Ownership review shortly. Just waiting to put on some more Kms to have a comprehensive view and also complete 1st service. Quick question, I could get the car to coast in first gear at 7kmph and in second gear at around 15kmph. How did you manage to coast in other gears ?

78, aurora.a15 , 17:11 ,Newbie,"Got the Nios Sportz AMT in Aqua Teal delivered last night for my wife. First impressions, nothing out of the blue, or rather reinforcing the excellent observations made by the good folks here in the past: 1. Steering is extremely light - very handy in avoiding the stupidly broken roads in Faridabad in the name of smart city (not so smart). But the steering is not at all eager to return to the centre. Infact i was left feeling that steering might even be tilted slightly to the right in its base position. Any way to check this properly? 2. Acceleration is not brisk but the trade-off rewards in the linearity of the build-up. 3. Solid - compared to my erstwhile booked car Swift Vxi AMT. I know it's still 2 stars in NCAP ratings but makes me feel more confident. Especially after my S Cross now feels lighter than i10 and is making me question my choice made 3 years ago. 4. Interior is perfectly designed. A little bit of hard surfaces - such as the arm rest for the right arm could be made softer. But i guess - cost cutting. 5. I miss the headrest adjustment but it's kinda okay for my height and pretty good for my wife's height. So it's okay i guess. 6. Overall, happy with the buy.

Akash Got the vehicle delivered on 30th Nov, took exactly 3 months from the date of booking. Driven approximately 500 km till now, happy with everything except the Lock / Unlock sound. I'm pretty sure I'm waking up my neighbours everyday since I got the car. ", 8th December 2022,hyundai-grand-i10,Bangalore,12,4
89, Eleanor_Shelby , 08:00 ,Newbie,"Hey Guys, Firstly, Mods I'm not sure if this query belongs here so feel free to move it, posting it here since this is the most active i10 thread. I recently purchased a 2014 Sportz i10 manual for my wife who is just learning how to drive. Its in great condition and has only run 36K kms. And was owned by an uncle who barely drove it and was ready to part with it for 1.5 Lakhs. So that's gonna be my wife's beater car till she gets confident behind the wheels. Now the car is great and all but that antiquated music console is an eye sore and I would like to upgrade that to an Android system with reverse parking camera integration. Is that possible? And if yes can you please recommend which particular system I can go with. And I do I also need to upgrade the speakers. I wanted to check here first before I go to the local shop as I have no knowledge about music systems and I just don't trust them to recommend the best product over the product with the best margin. Appreciate your inputs in advance! Thanks!", 2nd November 2023,hyundai-grand-i10,New,19,108
