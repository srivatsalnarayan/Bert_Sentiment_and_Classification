0, Omkar , 13:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Hyundai has finally taken the wraps off the India-spec third-generation i20, and we got to preview the car in Mumbai just before the official launch. It has been launched today at Rs. 6.80 lakh to Rs. 11.18 lakh. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the i20 was slated for an international launch at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2020. However, since the motor show got cancelled, the i20 was globally unveiled online and now that the restrictions are easing up worldwide, we have the official launch this festive season in India. You might have seen pictures of the Euro-spec car and yes, it looks very similar to the Indian-spec i20. However, the car for international markets is longer than the Indian car. Reason? The India-spec car’s length has been trimmed down to 3,995 mm to meet the sub-4m category and reap tax benefits. The good news, however, is that the wheelbase has been kept the same as the Euro-spec car at 2,580 mm. Compared to the previous generation Elite i20, this wheelbase is up by 10 mm and Hyundai claims that the interiors are much more spacious than before (more on this later). The car is now wider by 41 mm than the previous generation model at 1,775 mm. The height, however, has been left unchanged at 1,505 mm. The third generation i20 is built on Hyundai-Kia’s K-platform series. Different versions of this platform underpin the current crop of cars from the Korean manufacturer since 2017. The i20 will get a 1.0L turbocharged petrol (we love this motor), a 1.2L naturally-aspirated petrol and a 1.5L turbocharged diesel engine (we love this one too). Hyundai will offer a 7-speed DCT and a clutchless Intelligent Manual Transmission (iMT) with the 118 BHP, 1.0L turbocharged petrol engine. The 87 BHP, 1.2L Petrol will be available with a 5-speed manual transmission or CVT automatic. The 99 BHP, 1.5L diesel engine is offered only with a 6-speed manual transmission. I don't understand the logic of not offering the Diesel AT, especially when Kia is now offering it in the Sonet. There are many Diesel AT fans in India. There are loads of features including LED projector headlamps with LED DRLs, LED taillamps, projector fog lamps, 16-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels, sunroof, wireless charging, 10.24-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity, 7-speaker audio system by BOSE, Bluelink connected car technology, 6 airbags, electronic stability control, hill assist control and more. The new i20 will be available in four variants - Magna, Sportz, Asta and Asta (O). Hyundai is offering a choice of 3 years / 100000 km, 4 years / 50000 km or 5 years / 40000 km as the standard warranty packages. That's unique & very welcome! Extended warranty up to 5 years / 140000 km can be purchased additionally. We strongly recommend this extension. Hyundai is further offering 3 years Road Side Assistance and 3 years Bluelink subscription with the i20. The i20 features a body structure that comprises of 66% Advanced High-Strength Steel. Hyundai claims they have managed to get 13% higher tensile strength from the structure of the new i20: Hyundai’s recent car designs may have faced some criticism (Creta & Aura), but this one definitely plays it safer. We like the front! There aren’t many overly done bits and while the big grille covers most of the face, it blends in with the design. You'll also notice the lack of round elements or curvy bits. Instead, you have a lot of straight lines in the design: ‘Parametric Jewel’ pattern is what Hyundai calls this grille design. It extends from the headlights and is finished in gloss black. An air dam sits at the bottom which also gets a gloss black finish: Bottom of the air dam has a splitter-like design. It’s not something you’ll notice at first glance, but it does look cool: The bonnet has multiple creases & levels to give out a muscular look: The car on display was the 118 BHP, 1.0-litre turbo petrol version which gets this red ‘Turbo’ badge on the grille. We're so glad that the i20 has the full 118 BHP and not a detuned version like the Aura / i10. This will be a fast hatchback! A look at the headlamp cluster. Headlamps feature LED projectors along with LED DRLs. You also get a static cornering light next to the projector. Don’t miss the hexagonal design pattern inside the cluster: The LED DRLs were bright enough over the artificial lighting in the showcase room. The turn indicators are located on the inside edges of the headlamp cluster: ‘i20’ badge on the outside edge of the headlight: The foglamps are placed in this pizza-slice shaped enclosure, finished in piano black. These are halogen projectors: 3rd-gen car has a longer 2,580 mm wheelbase. The long wheelbase and restricted overall length mean that the front and rear overhangs are minimum. Do note the chrome window sill - we don't like the chrome on the door handles & C-pillar...it's excessive: 16-inch rims have a groovy design! They are shod with 195/55 R16 Ceat SecuraDrive tyres: ORVMs have integrated blinkers and a black casing: Upon unlocking the car, the horn beeps (meek sounding, single-tone horn) and the puddle lamps come on: DCT gearbox badging on the right fender: Sure has a lot of branding & badging! ""i20"" on the running board; I think it looks quite cool, but GTO doesn't like it: The first generation i20 had disc brakes at the rear. It was skipped on the Elite i20, and I was hoping this third-generation car would bring them back, but that’s not the case. You get drum brakes at the rear. Hyundai should’ve at least added rear disc brakes on this turbo-petrol variant! Rear wheel well has only partial cladding: The dual-tone black roof along with the red body colour was recently seen on the Grand i10 Nios turbo petrol variant, and IMO it looks great: Shark-fin antenna sits at the end of the roof: The rear looks contemporary with very little to complain about. It looked strange in all the leaked pictures, but after seeing it in person, I have no complaints. Will polarise opinions though. The black colour of the roof extends till the taillamps which looks well integrated from the rear as well as from the side. Notice how the bumper's black bottom reduces the visual bulk of it: These Z-shaped tail lamps have a split design. The tailgate part houses the turn indicators. There are multiple elements squeezed together neatly on the outside area of the light. The Z-shaped LED element forms the border and next to it is the brake light + reversing light (left to right in this picture). It is quite an intricately designed taillamp. Don't miss the ""i20"" branding & how the fuel flap has been neatly integrated with the light's design! A look at the LED element, all lit up: The use of chrome to connect the taillamps looks tasteless, but well, the mass market loves chrome! Perhaps, an LED element here would’ve felt more upmarket? The chrome Hyundai badge on the piano black applique looks good though (very Tata Altroz like): Thank God Hyundai decided to drop the ‘Elite’ prefix for the i20. Sounded too cheesy. Not to forget, those names become longer with time (i10 -> Grand i10 -> Grand i10 Nios): The bumper gets a diffuser-like design at the bottom finished in gloss black. No doubt it looks great, but it is also more likely to show scratches prominently. Check out the reversing camera neatly tucked above the number plate. Wondering if the camera's position is too low? The end of the C-pillar gets these aero fins similar to the ones seen on the Kona EV (reference image): ", 5th November 2020,hyundai-grand-i20,Mumbai,"1,737","21,011"
1, Omkar , 13:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"This all-black dashboard on the turbo-petrol variant is nice. Its not overtly exciting though and still has bland-looking bits. You now get these horizontal vent-like slats running across the dashboard which is unique to the i20. In addition to the slats, the steering + large ICE display + digital console catch your eye: Zooming in on the horizontal slat design of the dashboard. There are no soft-touch plastics here, but the quality is right up there with the best in the segment. Everything is well put together and feels built to last: This 4-spoke steering wheel is similar to the one weve seen on the Venue, except that it is not flat-bottomed. Steering-mounted controls are of good size and have a tactile feel to them: Fully digital instrument cluster! However, the design layout is hard to comprehend. The digital speedometer is still okay, but the counter-clockwise tachometer - that too digital - are two big NOs IMHO. Too hard to read, especially in a car thats supposed to be sporty (this particular turbo-petrol variant). Furthermore, the MID placed in the middle is similar to the current crop of Hyundai cars and looks like a mere carryforward. The instrument cluster on the UK variant has a far cleaner, premium design (reference image). Hyundai shouldve either gone the extra mile and gotten that UK one, or just kept it simple with analogue dials: Tyre pressure monitoring system is a nice addition. Low tyre pressures have caused many high-speed tyre bursts: The A/C vents also get red accents on this variant. Check out the neatly integrated start-stop button. The headlamp leveller and rearview monitor buttons have been placed below, along with the traction control button (telling you this car has ESP!): The horizontal slat theme continues on the door handle panel as well! Black & red leather seats are quite comfortable and provide good overall support: Manual adjustment levers for the driver seat. Notably, the height adjustment has a good range: Sporty pedals in the turbo-petrol. This floor matting is an accessory which was already in place on the display car. The i20 gets blue-coloured ambient lighting at various places, including the footwell and door pockets: Sunroofs are fun! The IRVM houses 3 buttons - SOS will place an emergency call to Hyundai customer care, the button with the tow truck will call Hyundai Roadside Assistance and the third button will launch Blue Link. All that technology, but no auto-dimming?! Come on, Hyundai: Another big attraction for Indian buyers  this massive 10.24 inch touchscreen. It stands out above the dashboard, alongside the instrument cluster (similar to the Kia Seltos). Has a crisp display with quick guide buttons at the bottom. Another benefit of having a wide screen like this is that you can enjoy a split display: There are loads of features, including Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The Bluelink has 50 connected car features including OTA map updates, remote engine start and geo-fencing. You also have voice command features, with the system responding to Hello Bluelink followed by your question or command: Check out the angle of the A/C controls with respect to the gear lever. The centre fascia is visibly tilted towards the driver which is a big : AC controls are minimalistic and sleek to operate. Red-coloured tips here as well: Below, you get 2 backlit USB ports and a 12V charging socket. The space below the slots is occupied by a wireless charging pad which also gets an ambient light: The ubiquitous Hyundai automatic gear lever. Do note that this turbo-petrol DCT variant doesnt get paddle shifters, sadly. Manual shifts are through the gear lever only: As is the norm with all Hyundai launches these days, the i20 also gets an air purifier: The glovebox is cooled and quite accommodating: Yet another crowd puller in this car is the 7-speaker BOSE sound system. It comprises of 4 door speakers, 2 tweeters (on the front doors) and a subwoofer in the boot along with this amplifier placed under the front passenger seat. We appreciate how manufacturers are now focussing on the in-car entertainment experience too: The previous-generation i20 had adequate room, but the Baleno had noticeably more space. The added cabin width and wheelbase have surely helped make the new i20's backseat more spacious than before: Here is a picture of me, with the driver seat adjusted to my position (I'm 5 10 tall). I had approximately 3.5-4 inches of knee room to spare! Has an armrest, but weirdly, no cupholders (the Elite i20 had cupholders here): Rear AC vents get red accents: Below, you have USB charging and a slot to park your mobile phone: Boot space has gone up to 311 litres (26L more than before). Its still not as accommodating as the Maruti Baleno (339 litres), Tata Altroz (345 litres) & Honda Jazz (354 litres): ", 5th November 2020,hyundai-grand-i20,Mumbai,"1,737","21,011"
2, Aditya , 13:05 ,Team-BHP Support,"Over the years, the Hyundai i20 has been one of the best selling cars in the B2 hatchback segment. On many occasions, it has sold well over 10,000 units a month! Quality, features and overall 'premium'ness have been strong points of the car. Needless to say this new i20 has big shoes to fill. I spent a day with the 2020 Hyundai i20. My quick & brief observations below: Overall, Hyundai have done a good job with the new i20. There is a range of engines and gearboxes to choose from. The star performer is the 1.0L turbo-petrol from the Venue, which makes the i20 quite a hot hatch. The ride is compliant and the handling is neutral. Besides, the car is loaded with features such as sunroof, Bose 7-speaker sound system, Blue Link telematics with 50 connected car features and over-the-air map updates, hill assist control, 6 airbags, fully digital instrument cluster with TPMS, rear air-con vents, wireless charging with cooling pad, air purifier, tilt & telescopic steering, ambient lighting and more. Theres a 5-year Wonder Warranty available as well. On the downside, many BHPians have found the higher variants to be overpriced - no doubt, this is an expensive hatchback with the top AT costing 13 lakhs OTR Mumbai (more in Bangalore). While the interior space and quality are good, the rear seat is placed low and its under-thigh support is compromised. Features such as an auto-dimming IRVM, auto wipers and split folding rear seats are missing. Another complaint we have is that the 195/55 section tyres run out of grip easily. An upgrade to better quality rubber is highly recommended. Exterior The car looks good from the front. Its neutral and unlikely to offend anyone. The rear end is exactly the opposite with weirdly shaped tail-lamps and a chrome strip running between the 2 light clusters - the derrière will divide opinions for sure. By and large, the car feels well put together. The bonnet, hatch & doors have some weight to them. The paint quality is top notch and fit & finish are best in the segment. Shut lines are nice and consistent - as expected from Hyundai. The new i20 draws a lot of attention from other road users. Since the i20 has been a popular car, people want to know more about the new model. Brand loyalty is strong here. Front end is dominated by a large, glossy black grille with a Turbo badge. DRLs are placed on top of the headlamp clusters and give the car good street presence: Rear end is a love it, hate it affair. I'm not fond of the chrome strip running between the two tail-lamp clusters; GTO on the other hand likes the design: Overhangs are short. Chrome bits are overdone: Sunroof appears small, but lets adequate light into the cabin: Exhaust pipe is neatly concealed by the rear diffuser: Interior On the inside, there are no soft touch materials used anywhere. It's all hard plastic, yet everything seems to be of good quality. The black dashboard with red inserts (in dual-tone body colours) looks very sporty. The sunroof prevents things from getting too dark. Space is good and the ergonomics are spot-on. I was at home in a matter of seconds of entering the cabin. The driver's seat offers enough support and with the sliding armrest, one can get comfortable in quick time. At the rear, there is more space than before. The problem is that the seat is placed very low. You have to sit down in this seat. Under-thigh support is compromised. As with most new cars, the i20's head-unit is now tablet-like. It's a 10.25-inch HD unit with Blue Link telematics, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and a Bose 7-speaker sound system. Sound quality is good for a stock system. The climate control is very effective and chills the interior in seconds even on a hot day. The rear air-vents help matters further. Black dashboard with red inserts. There are no soft-touch plastics here, but the quality is right up there with the best in the segment. Everything is well put together and feels built to last: Steering has rake and reach adjustment, which helps in getting the perfect driving position! Hyundai has dropped this from more expensive models, and I'm glad to see the i20 offering telescopic adjustment: Fully digital instrument cluster. We don't like this and prefer analogue dials, or the UK-spec i20's more premium display: TPMS and door ajar warnings for all doors, including the bonnet and sunroof (if engine is switched off). Sadly, a temperature gauge for the DCT is not provided: Sporty pedals in the turbo-petrol: All-black doorpads get a red insert and ambient lighting: Smart-looking black & red leather seats are quite comfortable and provide good overall support: Sliding armrest is handy: ORVMs are wide: IRVM covers the entire rear windshield. Sadly, it does not get auto-dimming: Massive 10.25-inch touchscreen. It stands out above the dashboard, alongside the instrument cluster. It has a crisp display with quick guide buttons at the bottom. Another benefit of having a wide screen like this is that you can enjoy a split display: 2 backlit USB ports and a 12V charging socket. The space below the slots is occupied by a cooled wireless charging pad which also gets an ambient light: As is the norm with all Hyundai-Kia launches these days, the i20 also gets an air purifier: The size of the sunroof is just adequate for the cabin: Rear seat is more spacious than before, but it is low and under-thigh support is poor. Seat back is not split: Rear air-con vents with a USB port below: 311 liters of boot space. It can be increased by folding the seatback forward. Subwoofer is located on the left, while a boot light and bag hook are on the right. 4 tie-down hooks are provided in the corners: Spare is a 15-inch steel unit with a 185/65 tyre: Driving the 1.0L Petrol AT The i20 petrol is powered by Hyundais in-house developed 998cc, 3-cylinder turbocharged engine. It's called the Kappa 1.0 Turbo GDI, and gets a direct injection fueling system, electronic wastegate actuator, a variable oil pump, oil spray jets for the pistons from the crank side and dual variable valve timing. This is the same engine that is used in the Venue. The 1.0L petrol produces a strong 118 BHP (@ 6,000 rpm) and 172 Nm (1,500 - 4,000 rpm). That power figure puts it ahead of its direct rivals, but the Polo 1.0L TSI matches it on torque. Hyundai is offering a 7-speed DCT as an option with the i20 1.0L petrol. The company has always been big on automatic gearboxes in India (right from the original Santro). The DCT is available only in the Asta and Asta (O) trim levels. Both are equipped with hill-start assist and electronic stability control. The i20 AT is the only car in the segment with a DCT. 7 ratios also result in a superior spread of gearing and this transmission does feel decidedly superior to its rivals, but sadly, there are no paddle shifters. The DCT gearbox is smooth and the entire package is very refined. On the flip side, it is substantially more expensive than its rivals. The i20 DCT is very refined at idle. It moves off seamlessly from a standstill. There is a slight initial lag though, as there is no torque-converter & due to the turbo-charger. Once you're moving, light accelerator input is all you'll need to commute in the city. The gearbox moves up early, while shifts are quick and smooth. Driving with a light foot, you'll never even know that the gears are being changed. They are almost imperceptible. The turbo-petrol offers enjoyable acceleration, while the power & torque on tap make the gearbox's job easier. We also liked how the gearbox is never found hunting for gears. Combine this smooth AT with the light steering, excellent ergonomics & clean frontal visibility and you have a sweet city ride. For bumper to bumper traffic conditions, there is a fair amount of 'crawl' available too. Just lift your foot off the brake pedal in 'D' and the i20 will crawl forward, allowing you to drive in bad traffic with just one pedal (the brake). Downside? The i20 DCT is reluctant to downshift from 2nd -> 1st. Hence, you'll need to be patient if you want to suddenly close a gap in slow traffic (as an example). Thanks to the powerful engine, the i20 DCT is a fast expressway cruiser. You can easily hit silly speeds and the mid-range is punchy. It sure comes in handy for overtaking. For long distance cruisers, the engine spins @ 2,600 rpm at 120 km/h (100 km/h = ~2,100 rpm). Kickdown response time is average. If the revvs are low, it takes a second or so for the gearbox + turbo to react. Sometimes, you'll find the gearbox to be hesitant to downshift too. But once the AT & turbo respond, this thing is very peppy. Will add that, when the engine is in the meat of the powerband, the reaction times are far lesser. The 7-speed DCT shifts faster than most of the gearboxes used by its rivals. Just wish Hyundai had given it paddle shifters. Manual mode is useful when you want to prepare the car for overtaking a fast vehicle on a 2-lane highway, or when you desire engine braking. Move the gear lever to the right to engage manual mode. The response time to your commands is quick. What we found disappointing was that, even here, you can take the revvs to just ~6,500 rpm (which is the start of the redline) before the transmission shifts up on its own. What is impressive is that, you can downshift even with the revvs at 3,800 rpm, which is more than most other ATs allow you to do. We'll keep our fingers crossed on the long-term durability of this gearbox. While it's reassuring to have a manufacturer with a track record for reliability backing it, the fact is that no dual-clutch gearbox has had a clean reputation in India. Not Ford's DCT, and certainly not VW's notorious DSG. We'll be keeping a keen eye on reports from i20 owners. Be sure to take that extended warranty package! Coming to NVH levels, the i20 does very well at slow speeds and around town. On revving, you can hear that familiar 3-cylinder thrum though. While this noise is there, it is not excessive. Theres almost no engine sound heard in the cabin if you're driving in a calm manner. Even while cruising on the highway, the engine is silent enough. What we appreciated is that the motor actually sounds nice when revved hard. Enthusiasts will like. Around 3,500 rpm, the engine gets audible, and is l-o-u-d above 6,000 rpm. Wind noise is minimal at 100 km/h, while road and tyre noise are par for the course. In terms of fuel economy, the i20 turbo-petrol DCT carries an ARAI rating of 20.25 km/l. 998cc turbo-petrol engine develops 118 BHP & 172 Nm: The ubiquitous Hyundai automatic gear lever. Do note that this turbo-petrol DCT variant doesnt get paddle shifters, sadly! There is a manual / sport mode though. To engage it, move the lever to the right. Push the lever up to upshift and down to downshift (just the way we prefer it): Ride & Handling The i20 uses a McPherson strut suspension with coil springs at the front and a coupled torsion beam at the rear. The suspension tune is sorted & owners will be satisfied. Low speed ride quality is compliant & mature, with small bumps being absorbed well. While the suspension feels firmer than the old i20, it is not excessively so. Only the bigger potholes make their presence felt inside. The car feels quite comfortable on the expressway as well. While our test car was equipped with 16"" wheels, lesser variants get 15"" rims with taller rubber which will be cushier. Out on the open road, straight line stability is excellent, while the handling is neutral & predictable. It's no VW or Ford, yet the behaviour is sorted. The i20 remains composed through fast corners too. There is some body roll, but it's controlled. The dynamics are clean with no nasty surprises at all, although again, it doesn't dismiss mid-corner bumps like a Polo does. Important to note that the Asta (O) and DCT variants are equipped with electronic stability control (ESC) which can be a lifesaver in emergency situations. The grip provided by the 195/55 Ceat Secura Drive tyres is acceptable for regular drivers. Enthusiasts with a hard driving style will want to upgrade to stickier rubber. The electric power steering is light and butter-smooth at parking / city speeds. Along with its small size, this makes for a very easy car to drive in urban conditions. On the highway, the steering is not nervous. Those days of crazy Hyundai steerings are gone. The steering weighs up alright at speed and it's not overtly sensitive either. No owner will complain. The car's behaviour is overall neutral in nature, as one would expect a mass market hatchback to be. All variants of the i20 come with disc brakes at the front and drums at the rear, with ABS + EBD. The brakes perform as expected. The car stops in a straight line sans drama when braking from high speeds. McPherson strut suspension with coil springs at the front: Rear suspension is a coupled torsion beam setup: ", 5th November 2020,hyundai-grand-i20,Mumbai,"17,608","76,004"
3, CEF_Beasts , 13:08 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Excellent detailed preview Only grouse I have is the price of the DCT variants, otherwise usual Hyundai way of loading the car with features to the brim. Though the 120bhp motor will be a hoot to drive, wish it had a manual transmission! Giving an iMT instead of a manual in a turbo version makes no sense.

4, sv97 , 13:08 ,BHPian,I agree the pricing is not justified and atrocious. But if we talk about the top-end variant then the Venue comes in the SX+ trim and not SX(O) trim in the DCT priced at 11.48 and 11.65 lacs respectively and is still priced higher than the i20 Asta(O) turbo DCT priced at 11.18 lacs. But the actual comparison should be with the Sonet GTX+ which is priced at 12.89 lacs so the difference of around 1.7 lacs is justified I suppose., 5th November 2020,hyundai-grand-i20,New,398,"1,035"

But, personally I see some issues with the package - 1. Pricing is on the higher side, about 50k - 1L more than I expected. 2. At this price - diesel should have been given the full spec tune. Hyundai went for the highest mileage tag instead. There is no diesel + TC option as well - which Kia offers in the Sonet. 3. A 120ps tune of the 1.0 TGDi should have been rewarded with a proper manual gearbox - at least in one of the trims.

Its base variant is priced at 5.6 and the highest selling Delta variant is 6.45 whereas i20 starts at 6.8 .

Another good thing is the placement of the DRVM switch which has been moved from the centre console to near the headlight leveller and ESP off switch as it is easier to reach for the driver now., 5th November 2020,hyundai-grand-i20,New,398,"1,035"

Something is very wrong with this new design language they have come up with, which makes their cars look a bit wonky, to be honest. Take the new i20 for example. From the front, the car looks like it's stooping lower and lower. This causes the car to have an awkward stance. Same is the case with rear, where the weird tail lamp clusters play the spoilsport. The Elite i20 styling was much cleaner and looked more sophisticated. In the interiors too, the horizontal slat like structure of the dashboard will be too much of a pain to clean the dust from.

Instrument cluster is simply a weird cartoon image. I can't imagine myself staring at that while driving. Would wait for our official drive review. 4) Can't understand why Hyundai is simply adamant with that lifeless 1.2L Petrol. Just too many feedbacks on vast threads and forums. May be they are wanting to push Turbo by deliberate contrast! I am not sure to personally feel Altroz will be in a advantageous position with this pricing difference.

41, AbidIqbalShaik , 16:10 ,BHPian,"The one things that no one seems to be talking about. Only the Sportz variant of the new i20 has wireless Android Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay in India (This variant has 8-inch touchscreen unit). The Asta and Asta (O) variants don't get such an important feature even though they are costlier and more premium (These variants have 10-inch touchscreen). I have attached a screenshot of the brochure below for your reference. I don't know what's the logic behind this decision from Hyundai. How can they give one feature in a low-end variant and miss it out on the top-end? Doesn't makes sense from a customer point of view. International variant of the new i20 with 8-inch touchscreen gets wireless Android Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay out of the factory, just like India. Whereas, the variants with 10-inch touchscreen will get this feature in H1 2021 (According to Hyundai's official launch video of the international variant; I've attached screenshot attached below for your reference). I wonder if that could be the case with Indian variant too. Hyundai should have clarified if the 10-inch variant will get the wireless Android Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay in future. Below is my something that I'm considering with regards to my car buying decision and I think it is something that would concern many people. I was looking for a car under INR 12 lakhs for my dad. I need it to have a good automatic gearbox (TC, CVT, DCT), wireless Android Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay (I don't want my dad to go through the hassle of connecting the cables. Plus, I don't want there to be wire clutter in my dad's car), cruise control, and most importantly, ESP. With the budget and all these features in mind, I was eyeing the new i20 and the Nissan Magnite as they were reported to have all the features that I want and come with a price tag that's suitable for me. Now, if I get the top-end automatic gearbox variant of the new i20, the 1L Turbo GDi Asta (O) 7DCT, I'll get a good gearbox, cruise control, and ESP. However, I'll miss out on wireless Android Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay. If I get the Sportz variant, I'll get wireless Android Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay. However, I'll miss out on cruise control and ESP. So, no matter even if I'm willing to spend INR 13 lakhs on road for the top-end automatic variant of the new i20, I'll not get the features that I want. Now, the top-end automatic gearbox variant of the Nissan Magnite, the XV Premium (O) CVT, has all the features that I want, i.e., ESP, cruise control, and also wireless Android Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay. Plus, that car is expected to cost around 11.5 lakhs on road (at least according to leaked comparison slides of the car). So, I'm getting everything that I want for 1.5 lakhs cheaper with the Magnite. No reason for me to go for the new i20. I know the quality of interiors (among other things) of the Nissan Magnite would not be as good as that of i20 but that's okay for me. Hard plastics don't bother me as much as the lack of ESP, cruise control, and wireless Android Auto and wireless Apple CarPlay. Also, people undermining wireless connectivity of the Android Auto and Apple CarPlay will know its importance once you start using the Android Auto and Apple CarPlay on a regular basis. However, some people could say otherwise. I think there are many people like me who would consider Nissan Magnite over the new i20 for the same reasons that I'm choosing the former over the latter.", 5th November 2020,hyundai-grand-i20,"Hyderabad,",46,279

The first gen i-20, as it was called, was more of a family car, with virtues of space, practicality and roominess emphasized over the drivability, sporty nature or sleekness, to me it was a new beginning of Hyundai as a feature-loaded, practical brand though it took much brickbats from the ""enthusiasts"" so to speak, who I felt, judged it for virtues not to be expected of it. The fluidic face-lift made things confusing as the i-20 felt neither here nor there, that's where Elite i20 changed things as handling and ride-quality were addressed, though the design cost the car interior space and a feeling of roominess, it never was a sporty car and it never should've been considered one, but it ticked all the boxes for most premium sub-4m car aspirants - noise isolation and NVH - double check, build quality and interiors - check, sophisticated styling in and out - check, features and comfort - segment leading as always, this legendary model in the Hyundai lineup defined the 10+k barrier of monthly sales as it hit the mark for more than a year after it debuted, that is always a sign that the public put their full faith and love in the model, there are people I know who own several high-end cars but still bought the Elite as a beater car they can punt around with on more than occasions, surely that speaks for the quality of the car. This sensuous-sportiness design language i20 has changed almost everything about the elite, except for the quality, in and out. No exterior panel is the same and the interiors are COMPLETELY different, not one button is similar either, the tactility and feel when interacting with the vehicle is typical Hyundai - plush, well damped buttons and levers, soft but solid thuds when doors and hatches are shut and anything in-between operates noiselessly and smoothly. Let's get down to the pluses and minuses now : + NVH is insane, I drove the thing for a bit and the noise is just not there, either from engine or from road (petrol, turbo, DCT) + Soft folding roof handles with coat-hooks in the Asta (O) + Very comfortable seating, just the right amount of softness and bolstering + Space - I'm a solid 5'10, a bit more with footwear on, and I adjusted the front for extra space as I'm a leggy person and I still had 3 inches in the back after comfortably sitting + Very good visibility, easily better than the previous gen + Very sharp, modern, dynamic styling that'll maybe not make everyone fall in love, but will offend none + Interiors are the new benchmark, no car stands a chance here, looks like a modern Audi, even C segment sedans look dated, including Verna + Steering is fantastic, first time I'm holding the new [ ] Hyundai signature steering and it feels solid and organic, the buttons are well laid out + Door shuts softly and solidly, sophisticated is the word for it + Sunroof brings plenty of light and openness to the cabin, though I won't dare open the glass, just the roof-lining + The massive blind-spot C-Pillar of Elite is gone, this one has fantastic visibility + The polyhedronesque parametric jewel grille is muted by its black tone, but look closer and it looks modern and daring - this car looks new, there is no escaping it + Same sheet metal quality as others, solid, cant make it flex unless more than average strength is put in and even then it barely flexes, better shut-lines, build and feel than Venue. + BOSE music system plays normal hindi songs and English pop music very, very well, deep bass and zero rattles or distortions, vocal songs are fantastic in terms of richness of output and reproduction. + Very practical, has a sunglass holder and two roof-lights at the front and middle despite the sunroof + Rear center armrest is fantastic - No soft folding roof handles in any variant other than Asta (O) - The doors, bonnet and hatch is feelsomely lighter in the new i20 than the Elite, the Elite surely has slightly heavier feel on the doors and hatch, it can't be due to new hinges as even the bonnet and hatch are lighter, not drastically but your hands can feel the difference. - Sunroof makes the roof-lining come down at the mid-point, across the B-pillars, and though it opens up again at the rear, it does make the cabin feel more claustro if I may say so - BOSE music system is bad at sound-stage, when playing ambiental, lounge, trance and electronica and I played around with the settings too, perhaps the tweeters are set too far and high (A-pillar mirror interior panel), sounded hollow and a bit distant, increasing volume won't help the cause, it'll get better as we get used to it, but the Elantra stock sound-system is on another level. - Once you sit inside its comfortable but ingress-egress is kind of not-so-convenient, this is where cars like Venue and Sonet shine. Not as bad as Polo or Baleno though, but Jazz takes this aspect home in the segment. - Rear center armrest doesn't get coffee-holders (just being cheeky here) - ALL the comfort/safety features like height adjustable head rest in rear, rear arm-rest, 4 extra airbags etc take a hike when downgrading to Asta, real arm-twisting going on to make people buy the Asta (O) - The bumper in front WILL scrape on Indian roads, just wait and watch, a deep pothole wont hit the chassis but the toothy bumper will grind, going in first My 10 cents : # If you're having an Elite i20 Asta (O), there is no need to upgrade, UNLESS you go for the DCT turbo # If you want easy ingress-egress and more airy cabin, the Venue or Sonet are no-brainers with the DCT, Sonet is the better deal since it has seat-ventilation # Though gearshifts were smooth in the few hundred meters drive I had, its to be seen if the DCT can shift fast and early, the Venue DCT tuning sucks, poor low end grunt. # If you want to buy the 1.2 NA engined new i20 to upgrade from the same engined Elite, do not bother and save your money # iVT with Turbo will make a great combo if reliability and smoothness is the need, but low end grunt will-not-be-there, as usual (coming from the Seltos experience) # The new car feels lighter, maybe because of the extra use of HSS and UHSS, but I cannot comment until the map of steel input is shown, but sheet metal gauge remains, solid as ever. # Slightly poor planning of bonnet shut lines as there is some ""give"" in it when pressure is put, very minor but the Getz had zero give around the bonnet lines # This is no more THE family car as the first i20 ever, was, Hyundai succumbed to the pressure and brickbatting by the ""enthusiasts"".

It's rapidly changing now. But i20 still would be different case study as top end DCT is priced similar to Venue DCT SX+. So will customer choose a CSUV with lesser features or a feature rich hatchback. Also it would depend how much does Hyundai wants to sell these.

There are exceptions though, in my car, the chrome coat of my gear lever started peeling after 4 years and the AC knobs started breaking one by one. Other than that, the main negative I had faced was with HASS, they try to con you whenever they can. Other than the above lapses, my i20 served me as loyally as possible for 6 years without a single major glitch where the car had to stay in the garage for more than 3 days (both because of normal part failure or due to some one else's fault - accident) Certain things which I don't agree with the newest offering is the deletion of features like auto dimming irvm, 4 wheel disc, auto wiper etc. These were very convenient and a person who have used them will surely miss them in the new car. Will I choose this i20 over the altroz et all.? Definitely if my pocket permits. i20 was never cheap but 13l + on road surely is insanity. But I would any day choose a Hyundai or a Toyota or a Honda over Tata, if required I would wait to have the necessary cash.

57, ron178 , 19:46 ,Senior - BHPian,"This new generation of the i20 seems fairly steeply priced, but it seems to be the general trend now. If one ignores the fact that this is a hatchback, the price seems reasonable, given the equipment available. I can only hope that at this price, Hyundai has improved on the safety aspect, which was my only real grouse with the older i20. I also wish the 1.2L normally aspirated petrol engine with the CVT automatic was available in the Asta(O) grade, because it would make for the perfect city commuter and would not have the in-city jerkiness of a dual-clutch gearbox. If the dynamics are well-sorted, the turbo-petrol variant has the potential to give the VW Polo TSI a run for its money, thanks to the additional ten horsepower and the dual-clutch automatic gearbox. About the styling, I feel the previous generation did look better, but the new one isn't half as polarising as some of Hyundai's other new designs. However, a two-tone interior, at least on the non-turbo variants, would be preferred. It makes the plastics look less scratchy and makes one feel like he/she is in a more expensive car, something Hyundai is known for. The previous i20 had the two-tone combination just right.

The M3 like curvy extension on the inside of the rear view mirror looks cool. The arrow shaped design looks quite nice with the whole car having a tapering wedge shape side profile. The front looks especially sharp. I love the fact that Hyundai has taken the initiative to provide nice embellishments like the the i20 badging on the side skirt, the rear lamp and the fuel cap. These kind of design features are typically seen on high end cars. And not like paying a bomb like VW charges you from the GT kit and stuff.

On the outside, the XL funky lights with awkward forward sweep at the back and too many creases everywhere are not to my taste.

77, deetjohn , 08:45 ,Senior - BHPian,"Is the pricing high? Well, that depends on a few things as always. Hatchback is one of my favorite forms for an automobile. I really cherish it - above pseudo SUVs, crossovers or even sedans in many cases. So, I wouldn't ever say a hatchback cannot cross a certain pricing threshold. I remember the furore over here when we picked up a Swift ZDi in 2011 for 7 lakhs OTR. A Maruti hatchback for so much was the question! That looks great value nowadays - but that's more to do with the extremely skewed market we have to endure over here. Anyways, pricing is always relative is what I want to say. Let's talk about the design first. I really dig that front end and wouldn't change a thing there. I see a lot of similarities to the 2014 Fiesta, especially the lines on the bonnet and the overall shape and proportions. And that's a great place to start! The side profile too works - just needs to dechrome it. But, what doesn't work is that rear. It looks like it was chopped and that was literally the case here due to the stupid small car rule. There is a Brio vibe to it, and that's not a good thing! Besides, I am not a huge fan of that oversized taillight and the chrome strip again. Coming to the inside, I like it. Yes, the one in the EU is definitely better with a superior instrument cluster and more analog buttons. But this is okay, Hyundai hasn't gone overboard and I like that in the interior. And it's well kitted too. The usual Hyundai cheapskating is evident though - no wash wipe in the lower variants at this premium even! Hyundai somehow puts rear wash wipe under comfort & convenience unlike most other manufacturers who puts it rightly under safety. They should have also given rear disc brakes - at least for the turbo models. As both diesel and petrol motors are very potent. For the 1.2 kappa however, one just need to roll down windows and put the hand out to catch the wind for the car to stop. There is no point in buying this car with that engine. That brings us to the driving experience and I am very eager to drive it. Hyundai is on the right track here, the recent launches have a very predictable driving experience compared to the horror show which was the case earlier. Have they been able to take it up a notch? Is it really rewarding with a good steering, well tuned suspension et al? Hope that's the case with the recent exploits of the brand with the N and WRC etc. But what I really worried about is the cost cutting under the skin. That has been the case with Hyundai for a few years now - ever since Hyundai stopped exporting to matured markets from India! And when a car is packed with this much kit, with so much to go wrong, I do not feel easy about it when the recent track record is very bad. As it stands now, I am more confident and comfortable about bringing the new Thar home than this i20. So, I will certainly give it time. I really hope that by pricing the car this high, Hyundai hasn't resorted to the usual cost cutting and what we are getting is an actual 'global car', even under the skin.

No doubt the new i20 would be a sales success and be one of the top 10 sellers, but atleast for some the Altroz would seem a much more sensible option. Tata, just bring the turbo petrol ASAP, ofcourse it is not high tech GDI, but atleast the option would be there at a lower price. Take a leaf from Magnite and offer the turbo petrol from the second base variant itself. DCT...take your own sweet time. Give the Nexon tune for the diesel atleast in some higher variants.

Furthermore, people quoting it to be in the range of 13-14 Lakhs is not the Manufacturer's fault, it's your state government which wants to cash in on here. The 1.0 GDi is anyway not a mainstream engine, Hyundai will continue to see the volume in 1.2 MT & iVT which isn't too expensive compared to Elite, along with the diesel which at around 10.5 for Asta (O) ain't too bad seeing how Nexon and Altroz diesel are priced.

If so, why not the other ""VFM"" alternatives like Ecosport/Figo/Polo GT TSi and perhaps the most loved car of all time, the Altroz? The fact that so many are lamenting the pricing shows that either they loved the car and they are angry about the pricing, or they simply want to trash the model before its even up for test-drives. 2) Have you personally inspected the i20, before coming to conclusions of size, interior room, build quality, music system, feel good quality etc? As I've said before, and I've said this with full respect to the other brands and what they deliver in terms of safety/value/driving dynamics etc, do NOT expect Hyundai to drive like a German (people like me do not want stone hard suspensions), or to have gearbox tuning like GT TSi (which is well calibrated and impressive to say the least) or have certified safety ratings (it hasn't been done until now, why keep crying about it?), the fact of the matter is, one should buy a car or brand they like, whether its TATA, or VW or Maruti, but pulling up Hyundai for not having the safety of TATA, driving dynamics of VW or FE of Maruti is plain silly to say the least. As far as Indian NCAP goes, lets not forget even VW and Skoda haven't sent their models for local crash tests yet, not indicating that they're poor as a result but they are uncertified, much like Hyundai. Yes there is a big question mark in the braking system of the platform twins Seltos and Creta, how many are affected is unknown and it's a fact that Hyundai is losing its bulletproof reliability tag and their silence isn't helping matters at all, but is Hyundai truly alone in this? Toyota recalled 45 lakh cars for cutting costs and using an unstable compound in the airbag inflator systems of Takata, they recalled millions more in the sudden accidental acceleration surge issues and both problems resulted in the deaths of at least a dozen people, Honda recalled 14 lakh cars for potential entry of petrol into the engine oil system which might result in fires and hundreds of thousands more for the same Takata inflator problem, all suppressed and all fatal issues. I have no problem with criticism, but I would hope that people take a first look, or a drive or simply wait for reviews before putting down a model, I've NEVER critiqued a model without sitting in it, and driving it personally, that's why I've not commented on the Altroz or Baleno, ever, but I have very much driven a GT TSi so I confidently can write about it. Last but not least, like voting, you do have a choice to put your money on the car you love and influence others to do the same, but that shouldn't come this early on when a car hasn't even been made available for a test drive. P.S - i20 and Sonet are strong contenders in our line of sight, I didn't flinch at the price tag of either, at all, not because I want to throw money away, but because I know this package works for 100% city use, with service centers at 1/2 km proximity and an undisturbed reliable ownership experience thus far over 15 years and 3 models.", 8th November 2020,hyundai-grand-i20,Beans,"1,847","8,351"

I completely agree. It's more of a good car spoilt by the pricing. I'm fully aware as a manufacturer, they have full rights to price their product they seem fit. But I'm not sure how their strategy of milking the situation of no worthy competitor to the fullest will pan out. They might still be able to get away with it, but it's definitely not going to redefine the segment in terms of sales. The overall negative sentiment regarding price is a testimony to that.

144, sid__kaps , 14:39 ,BHPian,"I took a test-drive of the new 1.0 turbo DCT i20 the day before and here are my thoughts on it. The exteriors are very aggressively styled, which in my opinion makes it polarizing, it works for me though, apart from that unnecessary chrome strip on the rear. Particularly liked the black highlights on the skirts, front and rear. The Starry Night shade furthermore accentuates the looks, which make it look quite premium if I might say so. Another new inclusion which I liked was the puddle lamps on the ORVMs. On entering in, the vehicle feels and is wider than the previous elite i20, legroom in the rear is decent, boot space is adequate (for a 2nd car in a household) under-thigh support was lacking a tad bit, but what made things seem glum was the all black interiors. It works for some people , but personally, I would have appreciated a dual tone option. The sunroof though improves things, as it would let in some light. Talking about the infotainment and instrument cluster, the touch response is quite slick, the sound quality of the Bose system is quite good as well, in short, being a Hyundai, it is technologically laden. I must mention the ambient lightning, it sets the environment and looks quite cool. I must confess, this was the first DCT transmission I have driven, so my views may not be entirely correct. In comparison to my current 2016 manual elite i20, this 2020 i20 feels quite alive, the steering is quite responsive and not animated like the one from my car, and the engine seems to have quite a pull. However, before the acceleration kicks in, there is a bit of lag, after which the vehicle pulls forward (with an engine like this, would have loved to have a manual gearbox option). While being seated, I felt that the seating felt a little low, but that is possible because I hadn't altered my seating position. The brakes felt secure and responsive as well. Our primary car is a 2018 Toyota Fortuner and we were looking to replace and maybe even upgrade from our i20. I do not see myself considering the 2020 i20, primarily because of the hefty 13.27 lakh price tag.

151, Dr.Mechanic , 13:39 ,BHPian,"After reading all the things being said about the price point of this car, felt I should log in and share an analogy that popped up in my mind. See, there are two kinds of laptops. Ones powered by Windows, and the others made by Apple, i.e., Macbooks. If you compare the performance of both of them at one price point, it becomes obvious that the Windows machines are way more VFM and outperform the Macs in budget and mid ranges. But people still buy the overpriced Macs, and get less bang for their bucks. This is due to the fact that even after 10 years of buying a Mac, it will run as smooth as it was first bought, because the manufacturer has great software and hardware support. On the Windows side, the laptop becomes rickety within 3-4 years, and you have to upgrade. Apple knows this, and they charge extra exactly for this better user experience.

Its simply called the ""Brand Value"" and the company charge a ""premium"" to sell the ""BRAND"". The problem arise actually in the long run. Where such brand start to just charge more premium as people accepts to pay just because for the brand and very objective of longevity and reliability is not met in their products in the real world! They only get that personal satisfaction of having bought the brand, but in reality the product offers less value to it. That's were hyundai is heading into by charging more premium with feature and Suzuki started to fall back and sticking to basics offering bland cars and less gimmicky features. At this point, people do not prefer suzuki with premium offerings, eg XL 6, S cross 1.6, Baleno RS, Ignis. All these models carry lowest volumes than others. Example. Nokia, Once the leader, it failed to sustain with the competition. Apple is soon loosing the trend with their recent cover up of deliberate software to slow the phones and they justify it to increase the battery efficiency. Take one plus, once positioned with slight premium chinese brand over oppo and vivo. in 2016 oneplus's hightest priced phone was about 35k and lowest being 17k. In 2019 their range was 35 to 65k. Now in 2020 they brought the cheaper Nord for 35k which is still expensive. Watch this case of Luxotticca! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvTWjWVY9Vo Same is what hyundai is doing now! Adding more premium with less features. Just check their variant distribution and features they offer in each. The price they charge w.r.t each variant is horrendous.

On the Windows side, the laptop becomes rickety within 3-4 years, and you have to upgrade. Apple knows this, and they charge extra exactly for this better user experience. This was true some 6 or 7 years ago but its completely different now. The mistake people do is they compare a Macbook with low to mid range windows laptops. Rather, they should be comparing them with premium windows laptops competing in the same price range like the Thinkpad line from Lenovo, XPS line from Dell, Spectre & Envy lines from HP, Zenbook line from Asus or the Surface line from Microsoft. All have equivalent build quality to a mac and perform much better. Moreover they are a safer choice as they can do everything a mac can do and some more. And windows is very polished and stable now than it has ever been. I don't even remember the last time I had a blue screen error. The best example I can give is for mechanical engineers like me, I can't run Solidworks, Ansys, Pro-E or Catia on the mac. Even matlab support wasn't there during my undergrad. Similarly many of my friends from variety of branches didn't have the required softwares on the platform. The only department which found them to be useful was computer science. And the less we talk about gaming, the better for Macs And coming to reliability, we can see decade old thinkpads which are from the same segment of mac, being used by organizations in a variety of harsh conditions, in testing labs and many other challenging areas. And the latest laptops have been very reliable. And the reliability isn't good on the other side as well with the horrifying butterfly keys getting stuck, overheating macbook pros making them unusable and many more. Maybe the tables are turning around now. So, coming back to cars, yes the market leaders may have been very good 3 or 4 years ago and are a more reliable and safe choice even now (or are they?) but the competition has caught up and has even surpassed in many areas like Tata cars offering safety, style and value, VW and Skoda TSIs plastering on enthusiasts' faces - at the same time being safe and their upcoming launches do seem exciting, Mahindra giving a proper desirable full blown off-road Jeep for the masses as well as offering safe cars like XUV300 and Marazzo at the same time. Definitely from what I am seeing, the tables are definitely turning and the ever reliable Hyundais are being plagued by braking issues that are shamelessly being wiped under the carpet by the management or the reduction in overall safety of their cars compared to competition and many more. The GNCAP crash test results today were definitely eye opening for many. I don't hate Hyundai and Maruti but feel that it is their time to embrace the change. They still have the best powertrains overall. But taking the market for granted and rolling watered down models is not ok at all. Yes, the competitors wouldn't have offered best after sales experience before but they are showing the intent that they are ready to embrace the change and offer better services to their customers. Have seen social media handles of Tata being very active to customer complaints, Zac Hollis - MD of Skoda India, himself being proactive in engaging with customers, taking suggestions and addressing their complaints. So, definitely the old undesirable ones are becoming more desirable now just as we have amazing windows laptops at every price segment, commanding 85 to 90% of PC market share (though windows never had a quantity problem, just the quality part) . Maybe its time to embrace the other car makers. But it will anyway boil down to individual preference. After all, its their hard earned money that people are spending.

However it's sales were a runaway hit and no one even bats any eyelid at it's current 20 lakh sticker price. 24-30L for the smaller Jeep Compass - not an issue now. People say it's worth it given the 2.0L diesel engine and the fine handling. So it is a matter of what you are willing to pay for, for value that you as a the buyer percieve. Other SUV buyers will certainly scoff at paying so much for the Compass' cramped interiors and might find the Creta to be a bargain in this respect. Heck we had people ready to pay 15L for a VW Polo GTI...including yours truly. I think while on one hand it is a sign that people are prepared to pay more and cars are getting more expensive, it's also a sign of our market maturing. People are starting to make choices not based just on size and form factor but more on the conveniences that a car offers. The i20 offers even a sun roof. Customers are beginning to gravitate towards a car that meets their needs in terms of size but not willing to stint on conveniences like AT, FATC, sun roofs, premium driving experiences, well appointed cabins etc. You can see similar trends in the European industry. Hot hatches cost as much as sedans and readily find customers. As a serial hatch back owner, who had little use for bigger cars I for one will be ready to pay for the i20 given that fact that I don't have to compromise on features and enjoy them in a smaller car.

161, Aditya , 11:01 ,Team-BHP Support,"Over the years, the Hyundai i20 has been one of the best selling cars in the B2 hatchback segment. On many occasions, it has sold well over 10,000 units a month! Quality, features and overall 'premium'ness have been strong points of the car. Needless to say this new i20 has big shoes to fill. I spent a day with the 2020 Hyundai i20. My quick & brief observations below: Overall, Hyundai have done a good job with the new i20. There is a range of engines and gearboxes to choose from. The star performer is the 1.0L turbo-petrol from the Venue, which makes the i20 quite a hot hatch. The ride is compliant and the handling is neutral. Besides, the car is loaded with features such as sunroof, Bose 7-speaker sound system, Blue Link telematics with 50 connected car features and over-the-air map updates, hill assist control, 6 airbags, fully digital instrument cluster with TPMS, rear air-con vents, wireless charging with cooling pad, air purifier, tilt & telescopic steering, ambient lighting and more. Theres a 5-year Wonder Warranty available as well. On the downside, many BHPians have found the higher variants to be overpriced - no doubt, this is an expensive hatchback with the top AT costing 13 lakhs OTR Mumbai (more in Bangalore). While the interior space and quality are good, the rear seat is placed low and its under-thigh support is compromised. Features such as an auto-dimming IRVM, auto wipers and split folding rear seats are missing. Another complaint we have is that the 195/55 section tyres run out of grip easily. An upgrade to better quality rubber is highly recommended. Exterior The car looks good from the front. Its neutral and unlikely to offend anyone. The rear end is exactly the opposite with weirdly shaped tail-lamps and a chrome strip running between the 2 light clusters - the derrière will divide opinions for sure. By and large, the car feels well put together. The bonnet, hatch & doors have some weight to them. The paint quality is top notch and fit & finish are best in the segment. Shut lines are nice and consistent - as expected from Hyundai. The new i20 draws a lot of attention from other road users. Since the i20 has been a popular car, people want to know more about the new model. Brand loyalty is strong here. Front end is dominated by a large, glossy black grille with a Turbo badge. DRLs are placed on top of the headlamp clusters and give the car good street presence: Rear end is a love it, hate it affair. I'm not fond of the chrome strip running between the two tail-lamp clusters; GTO on the other hand likes the design: Overhangs are short. Chrome bits are overdone: Sunroof appears small, but lets adequate light into the cabin: Exhaust pipe is neatly concealed by the rear diffuser: Interior On the inside, there are no soft touch materials used anywhere. It's all hard plastic, yet everything seems to be of good quality. The black dashboard with red inserts (in dual-tone body colours) looks very sporty. The sunroof prevents things from getting too dark. Space is good and the ergonomics are spot-on. I was at home in a matter of seconds of entering the cabin. The driver's seat offers enough support and with the sliding armrest, one can get comfortable in quick time. At the rear, there is more space than before. The problem is that the seat is placed very low. You have to sit down in this seat. Under-thigh support is compromised. As with most new cars, the i20's head-unit is now tablet-like. It's a 10.25-inch HD unit with Blue Link telematics, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and a Bose 7-speaker sound system. Sound quality is good for a stock system. The climate control is very effective and chills the interior in seconds even on a hot day. The rear air-vents help matters further. Black dashboard with red inserts. There are no soft-touch plastics here, but the quality is right up there with the best in the segment. Everything is well put together and feels built to last: Steering has rake and reach adjustment, which helps in getting the perfect driving position! Hyundai has dropped this from more expensive models, and I'm glad to see the i20 offering telescopic adjustment: Fully digital instrument cluster. We don't like this and prefer analogue dials, or the UK-spec i20's more premium display: TPMS and door ajar warnings for all doors, including the bonnet and sunroof (if engine is switched off). Sadly, a temperature gauge for the DCT is not provided: Sporty pedals in the turbo-petrol: All-black doorpads get a red insert and ambient lighting: Smart-looking black & red leather seats are quite comfortable and provide good overall support: Sliding armrest is handy: ORVMs are wide: IRVM covers the entire rear windshield. Sadly, it does not get auto-dimming: Massive 10.25-inch touchscreen. It stands out above the dashboard, alongside the instrument cluster. It has a crisp display with quick guide buttons at the bottom. Another benefit of having a wide screen like this is that you can enjoy a split display: 2 backlit USB ports and a 12V charging socket. The space below the slots is occupied by a cooled wireless charging pad which also gets an ambient light: As is the norm with all Hyundai-Kia launches these days, the i20 also gets an air purifier: The size of the sunroof is just adequate for the cabin: Rear seat is more spacious than before, but it is low and under-thigh support is poor. Seat back is not split: Rear air-con vents with a USB port below: 311 liters of boot space. It can be increased by folding the seatback forward. Subwoofer is located on the left, while a boot light and bag hook are on the right. 4 tie-down hooks are provided in the corners: Spare is a 15-inch steel unit with a 185/65 tyre: Driving the 1.0L Petrol AT The i20 petrol is powered by Hyundais in-house developed 998cc, 3-cylinder turbocharged engine. It's called the Kappa 1.0 Turbo GDI, and gets a direct injection fueling system, electronic wastegate actuator, a variable oil pump, oil spray jets for the pistons from the crank side and dual variable valve timing. This is the same engine that is used in the Venue. The 1.0L petrol produces a strong 118 BHP (@ 6,000 rpm) and 172 Nm (1,500 - 4,000 rpm). That power figure puts it ahead of its direct rivals, but the Polo 1.0L TSI matches it on torque. Hyundai is offering a 7-speed DCT as an option with the i20 1.0L petrol. The company has always been big on automatic gearboxes in India (right from the original Santro). The DCT is available only in the Asta and Asta (O) trim levels. Both are equipped with hill-start assist and electronic stability control. The i20 AT is the only car in the segment with a DCT. 7 ratios also result in a superior spread of gearing and this transmission does feel decidedly superior to its rivals, but sadly, there are no paddle shifters. The DCT gearbox is smooth and the entire package is very refined. On the flip side, it is substantially more expensive than its rivals. The i20 DCT is very refined at idle. It moves off seamlessly from a standstill. There is a slight initial lag though, as there is no torque-converter & due to the turbo-charger. Once you're moving, light accelerator input is all you'll need to commute in the city. The gearbox moves up early, while shifts are quick and smooth. Driving with a light foot, you'll never even know that the gears are being changed. They are almost imperceptible. The turbo-petrol offers enjoyable acceleration, while the power & torque on tap make the gearbox's job easier. We also liked how the gearbox is never found hunting for gears. Combine this smooth AT with the light steering, excellent ergonomics & clean frontal visibility and you have a sweet city ride. For bumper to bumper traffic conditions, there is a fair amount of 'crawl' available too. Just lift your foot off the brake pedal in 'D' and the i20 will crawl forward, allowing you to drive in bad traffic with just one pedal (the brake). Downside? The i20 DCT is reluctant to downshift from 2nd -> 1st. Hence, you'll need to be patient if you want to suddenly close a gap in slow traffic (as an example). Thanks to the powerful engine, the i20 DCT is a fast expressway cruiser. You can easily hit silly speeds and the mid-range is punchy. It sure comes in handy for overtaking. For long distance cruisers, the engine spins @ 2,600 rpm at 120 km/h (100 km/h = ~2,100 rpm). Kickdown response time is average. If the revvs are low, it takes a second or so for the gearbox + turbo to react. Sometimes, you'll find the gearbox to be hesitant to downshift too. But once the AT & turbo respond, this thing is very peppy. Will add that, when the engine is in the meat of the powerband, the reaction times are far lesser. The 7-speed DCT shifts faster than most of the gearboxes used by its rivals. Just wish Hyundai had given it paddle shifters. Manual mode is useful when you want to prepare the car for overtaking a fast vehicle on a 2-lane highway, or when you desire engine braking. Move the gear lever to the right to engage manual mode. The response time to your commands is quick. What we found disappointing was that, even here, you can take the revvs to just ~6,500 rpm (which is the start of the redline) before the transmission shifts up on its own. What is impressive is that, you can downshift even with the revvs at 3,800 rpm, which is more than most other ATs allow you to do. We'll keep our fingers crossed on the long-term durability of this gearbox. While it's reassuring to have a manufacturer with a track record for reliability backing it, the fact is that no dual-clutch gearbox has had a clean reputation in India. Not Ford's DCT, and certainly not VW's notorious DSG. We'll be keeping a keen eye on reports from i20 owners. Be sure to take that extended warranty package! Coming to NVH levels, the i20 does very well at slow speeds and around town. On revving, you can hear that familiar 3-cylinder thrum though. While this noise is there, it is not excessive. Theres almost no engine sound heard in the cabin if you're driving in a calm manner. Even while cruising on the highway, the engine is silent enough. What we appreciated is that the motor actually sounds nice when revved hard. Enthusiasts will like. Around 3,500 rpm, the engine gets audible, and is l-o-u-d above 6,000 rpm. Wind noise is minimal at 100 km/h, while road and tyre noise are par for the course. In terms of fuel economy, the i20 turbo-petrol DCT carries an ARAI rating of 20.25 km/l. 998cc turbo-petrol engine develops 118 BHP & 172 Nm: The ubiquitous Hyundai automatic gear lever. Do note that this turbo-petrol DCT variant doesnt get paddle shifters, sadly! There is a manual / sport mode though. To engage it, move the lever to the right. Push the lever up to upshift and down to downshift (just the way we prefer it): Ride & Handling The i20 uses a McPherson strut suspension with coil springs at the front and a coupled torsion beam at the rear. The suspension tune is sorted & owners will be satisfied. Low speed ride quality is compliant & mature, with small bumps being absorbed well. While the suspension feels firmer than the old i20, it is not excessively so. Only the bigger potholes make their presence felt inside. The car feels quite comfortable on the expressway as well. While our test car was equipped with 16"" wheels, lesser variants get 15"" rims with taller rubber which will be cushier. Out on the open road, straight line stability is excellent, while the handling is neutral & predictable. It's no VW or Ford, yet the behaviour is sorted. The i20 remains composed through fast corners too. There is some body roll, but it's controlled. The dynamics are clean with no nasty surprises at all, although again, it doesn't dismiss mid-corner bumps like a Polo does. Important to note that the Asta (O) and DCT variants are equipped with electronic stability control (ESC) which can be a lifesaver in emergency situations. The grip provided by the 195/55 Ceat Secura Drive tyres is acceptable for regular drivers. Enthusiasts with a hard driving style will want to upgrade to stickier rubber. The electric power steering is light and butter-smooth at parking / city speeds. Along with its small size, this makes for a very easy car to drive in urban conditions. On the highway, the steering is not nervous. Those days of crazy Hyundai steerings are gone. The steering weighs up alright at speed and it's not overtly sensitive either. No owner will complain. The car's behaviour is overall neutral in nature, as one would expect a mass market hatchback to be. All variants of the i20 come with disc brakes at the front and drums at the rear, with ABS + EBD. The brakes perform as expected. The car stops in a straight line sans drama when braking from high speeds. McPherson strut suspension with coil springs at the front: Rear suspension is a coupled torsion beam setup: ", 12th November 2020,hyundai-grand-i20,Mumbai,"17,608","76,004"

197, Potenza , 13:06 ,BHPian,"Got home this piece of gorgeousness on the 11th. Its the all singing all dancing 1.0 Turbo DCT Asta (O) in Titan Grey Colour. Drove home to Pune yesterday and absolutely loved the drive. A few observations from the 250 odd km that I've completed so far:The car drives like a considerably bigger car. Road holding and high speed stability is top notch and the ride quality is great. My other car is a GT TSI (1.2) and the i20 has a big car feel which the GT just cannot match. The cabin is extremely silent and the insulation does a great job of not letting outside noise filter in. Being a new car I didn't want to stretch its legs too much. Drove on the e-way at 100 kmph with the cruise control on and the speed felt much slower than 100. The 1.0 Turbo is super refined, and the DCT does a pretty good job of masking the engine's weak bottom end. There is a bit of lag in throttle response when one wants to move the car by just a few feet. Climbing the Khandala Ghat was a breeze. The strong mid range of the 1.0 Turbo is brilliant and the DCT was downshifting without any lag in the reasonably relaxed manner that i was driving in. As mentioned earlier I was not really pushing the car. The expressway drive was in bright sunshine and I noticed that the car doesn't seem to have tinted/green heat insulating glass. Equipment level is excellent although why Hyundai skipped on the auto-dimming ORVM and rain sensing wipers is beyond me. The front seats are super snug and there were no aches and pains after the three hour drive. The Titan Grey colour looks absolutely brilliant on this car. The black side skirts, bumper inserts and rear windscreen shroud gels very well with the grey. The air purifier blocks out one cup holder and I am not sure if it is detachable.

With a confined design space and similar set of constraints, there, is only so much you can do with optimization to increase rigidity of the structure. Beyond a point adding extra material would be the only way to improve the structure. Offcourse, material change would be another big improvement but, automobile industry being such a huge market, most OEMs should be using similar grade steel for making their cars. Now, if you were to replace steel or high strength steel ( I am really curious how much higher the strength actually is) with another material like composites then it will be a whole new scope for optimization like in some of the higher end cars such as BMWs and Audis. In conclusion, I believe the assumption that higher weight (more steel) equals more structural strength is a decent one. There is merit to that assumption. The above explanation is speculative and an extrapolation of my experience in aerospace industry. I am not from automobile industry but, I have worked in the structural analysis field.

217, docswarna26 , 00:06 ,BHPian,"Being an avid team-bhp reader through years (though somehow not an avid poster in the forum), one thing I find encouraging, is over the years people questioning a car's safety have increased by leaps & bounds. Its the same scenario in the general public. Public has also started questioning a car's safety. Yes, i20 will be a runaway success without having NCAP ratings, but then any change takes time.... Give it a decade & no company will be able to sell below par safe cars. Somehow I feel, car manufacturers should be given the option of buying a competitors car and donating it GNCAP for testing and show their expense under corporate social responsibility (CSR). This is the right way to deal with companies (read Maruti) who say ""they won't send their car to GNCAP for testing"" (Maruti literally said this & Hyundai is avoiding comment directly and just saying ""they have increased the amount of high tensile steel""). [Currently, either a manufacturer have to send their car for testing and bear the expense or GNCAP can themselves purchase and test]. Second point, Venue tested 4 stars in ANCAP testing. Is the same version being sold here in India? Is it safe to assume then that Sonnet will also be 4 stars?

Just have a hearty laugh at the sheer ignorance of those who make such statements. I've got a query. Does your car make those horn beep sounds when locking/unlocking it while using the remote buttons? It did make the beeping sound. However it can be turned off by simultaneously pressing the lock and unlock buttons on the smart key for a few seconds. To answer the two queries above: 1. We basically wanted an automatic hatchback and really liked the Baleno. However the Baleno is pretty much at the end of its lifecycle and i didn't quite fancy buying a product which was going to be replaced in a years time. Hence we waited for the i20 and pre-booked it. The availability of a turbo-petrol and dct combination also tilted the scales heavily in its favour. 2. When the prices were announced we were as shocked as everyone else was. But finally we still decided to go in for it because: a. No other product at this price point offered the same level of equipment along with the turbo petrol and DCT combination (that was very important). The Kia Sonet came close but that cost 1.7 lakhs more. b. We are not big fans of Sub 4m SUVs. The i20 is has more space than either the Venue or the Sonet and honestly buying a small SUV for 15 lakhs did not appeal to me. Spending 13.2 on a hatch was much more palatable. 3. Comparison with the GT-TSI: Its too early but initial impressions are that the GT will be more fun to drive since it has a much more aggressive power delivery as compared to Hyundai's 1.0 Turbo. The Hyundai engine is much more relaxed in its demeanour. However, the i20 seems to offer a much more mature driving experience since it drives and rides like a much bigger car. Final impressions will only happen after i push the i20 a bit. The gearbox seems to be pretty similar in both cars. In fact I think the Hyundai DCT seems to be smoother especially in upshifts.

A manufacturer can voluntarily give their cars to GNCAP, like what Tata did for Nexon with changes, Altroz before launch and Mahindra with XUV 300. 3. As of now due to financial issues, only cars that are major sellers in each segment is being tested. All cars that are tested will be base model. Before publishing the results, the manufacturers will be informed and they can request for improving cars by making changes to get higher rating.

Yep! The kerb weight of 1076 kg as mentioned before, is applicable only to the 1.0 Kappa T-GDi DCT Asta(O) variant. Without the sunroof, side & curtain airbags, ESP+VSM etc., the lower variant is bound to be somewhat lighter (by 25 ~ 30 kg is my guess). The iMT variants may weigh marginally less than the corresponding DCT ones. The 1.5 CRDi variants are bound to be heavier. Hyundai U2 series diesel engines are generally heavy because of their cast iron blocks. The 1.2 Kappa CVT variants may weigh in the same range as the corresponding 1.0 Kappa T-GDi iMT & DCT variants. This is again just a guess. The 1.2 Kappa MT variants would weigh the lightest in the i20 range. By how much? ""Lighter by upto 100 kg compared to the previous platform"" is the claim made by Hyundai, according to reports. Does this mean a 1.2 Kappa MT variant would weigh a mere 918 kg compared to the 1076 kg of the 1.0 Kappa T-GDi DCT Asta(O)? A difference of a whopping 158 kg???

257, NiInJa , 19:57 ,Senior - BHPian,"My cousin got his i20 1.2 Sportz delivered on Diwali. Took it for a short spin and was bowled over by the silence inside the cabin. The only faint noise I could hear was of the tyres rolling on the road. Super refined ! The car looks smashing in that dark red color. And the sportz variant has halogen lamps so no circular ring inside the headlamp housing looks neat. The Sportz variant covers almost all aspects that one would need in a car except for rear wash wipe and adjustable rear head rests. One thing that I really liked was that Hyundai offered TPMS in the Sportz variant. The steel wheels covered with plastic look like alloys, honestly, I don't think why one would upgrade the wheels over this setup, they are abuse friendly and yet look like alloys. The rear camera has variable guidelines which work well and the sound quality of the ICE was good enough to keep one engaged. The thing that was typical of Hyundai was the super light steering which didn't feel connected. The halogen bulbs need to be upgraded as the high beam was not as bright and focused as one would expect. With fog lamps on, the high beam works better as there is no dark spot close to the car. The fog lamps are excellent by the way. Also, the steering, although good to hold had some rough edges around the thumb contours, as in, I could happily scratch my thumb on it while driving. None of the above are deal breakers in my opinion. Overall, I am happy that he waited for the i20 and not buy the Baleno.", 20th November 2020,hyundai-grand-i20,Pune,"1,052","3,691"
258, oldmonk85 , 20:19 ,Newbie,"I took a back to back TD of the new i20 1.0L Turbo DCT and the VW Polo 1.0 L Turbo Torque convertor. I could manage only short TDs. Here are my thoughts. I don't know if this message fits into this thread. Mods please excuse me and move it to the appropriate thread. Looks ------- The i20 rear looks really good, the front looks good too. The looks are quite modern and someone who likes a bit of sharp cuts and Zs will definitely like it. The Polo, it's a timeless design. Some might call it dated but it doesn't seem to get old for me. Interiors ---------- As expected the i20 feels very spacious compared to the Polo specially in the rear seat. Even in the front seats the i20 feels wider and roomy. Lots of bells and whistles on the i20 top variant but its premium feel suddenly and significantly disappears in the lower trims. Even in the top variant I felt like I was sitting in a spaceship with the lines and the 10 inch infotainment system. Its probably just me but I don't prefer the raised infotainment systems which have started to become a trend in the newer Hyundai/Kia's. It probably finds it utility in navigation but other than that I find it quite a vision hindrance for a person of my height (5'5""). I personally still like the sober and clean looks of the Polo Highline TSI dashboard. The size of the infotainment system is smaller in comparison to the i20 but its position is better for a hatch in my opinion and I feel all the design elements fit seamlessly with each other. The looks of the steering wheel is also much better and premium on the VW Polo. The place where the Polo scores horribly is in the space. Although for a person of my height the rear seat is fine, it still feels quite cramped in terms of the width and the head room is also very less. Driving -------- The drive of the Polo seemed way better than the i20 turbo. In the i20 the turbo kicked in suddenly and unpredictably and the car would thrust forward, it got a little harder to control when there were other vehicles closer. The Polo was a much better in this aspect, it seemed more controlled and was more predictable. The Polo overall was much more easier and controlled to drive and I found the Polo's Torque converter better than the i20's DCT. My drives were short so my experience is still limited. For me the Polo beats the i20 by miles in driving. My focus was not on the features but I am sure the i20 will beat the Polo by miles in this department. Cost ---- i20 Asta 1L DCT - 13.96L OTR (Bangalore) Polo Highline 1L tubo TC - 11.18L OTR (Bangalore) Personal opinion - I like the Polo much more than the new i20 in all aspects other than space. It feels more classy. The rear space is horrible in the Polo and the large hump of the tunnel at the rear seat leg space makes it even more difficult.

I do consider the latter two as essential features and omission of these immediately removes the car from considering it. The Asta IVT which costs around 11.5L OTR in Hyderabad doesn't come with Adjustable rear Headrests. The positioning is aimed to force early buyers to go for the higher variants and down the line, they will introduce Magna+ and Sportz+ variants at marginal price increase with these missing features.", 21st November 2020,hyundai-grand-i20,BOM,37,91

272, aaggoswami , 22:54 ,Senior - BHPian,"Had a look at new i20 today. Here are my few observations : 1. Door felt light, more in tune with Maruti than VW. As compared to its predecessor, new i20 felt like lacking in heft of doors. This was an unpleasant surprise. 2. Boot hatch also felt lighter. The overall quality feel while operating hatch of outgoing car was simply absent. The variant we saw was Asta, penultimate trim, it had a provision of recess to close hatch. Didnt' feel as well built as the asking price commands it to be. Rear windshield didn't have any sort of rubber insulation from inside the hatch. When the trim touches a million rupees or cross the magical million rupee price tag, things could have been better. Still I am sure Hyundai would have worked well for NVH, credit where its due though this is more of an anticipation. OT : I had a ride in Sonet DCT top end trim, the level of cabin insulation Hyundai/Kia provides is simply class leading. I bought grand i10 over Liva and Swift due to this part of excellent cabin insulation. 3. Front seats : Surprisingly comfortable! They are pretty high set for a low slung hatchback. Perhaps excessive underthigh support for those who are not very tall. Appreciate this fact, Ciaz owners would find solidarity here. However, same problem in i20 as I faced in Venue : If I am seated on co-driver seat, my left elbow room is very poor. Else a departure from what I expected from Hyundai. Space is not a concern. Decent size of footwell as well. 4. Rear Seat : Quite low. Not so good underthigh support. But the penultimate trim doesn't get adjustable rear headrests ! Why Hyundai ? IIRC, the first generation Santro had rear adjustable headrests and Zen didn't have it. Really weird and cunning way to push for top trim. Lower seat means those upgrading cars like Wagon R/Celerio/Santro will find the rear slightly claustrophobic. Just my view. 5. Front Bumper chin is quite low. Car also looks overtly aggressive for a small car. Steering wheel felt excellent to hold, very, very premium. Hyundai knows how to improve or provide segment best touch points. Car is quite low overall. Swift for example doesn't feel so low. Overall, from my brief view of i20, it doesn't feel that it commands such a hefty price tag. The tough or robust feel of previous generation is lost. And I fail to understand what all the hype is all about.

While the Sonet is the best all-rounder within 4m rule today, by a large margin, your assessment of the i20 is not realistic/complete without a test drive. Once you drive the car you'll be astounded by the eerie silence of the cabin and Fiat-like, flat, pothole gobbling ride quality, trust me I put it to its paces. The cabin felt as good as the Elantra in terms of ride and NVH, the steering had plenty of feedback and the interior ergonomics (driver side) is comparable to luxury brands. All said I agree the car has lost weight, I mentioned it on the driving impressions a month ago, but the sheet metal is just as sturdy as the last gen and the car is sure footed even more despite the weightloss.

But I don't really have a lot of experience with high-end cars, so my ""fast"" might be your ""slow"" .", 8th December 2020,hyundai-grand-i20,Bengaluru,9,7

Maybe, but its not that I like speed either, I hate speed-demons who are aplenty on the roads and they like to push a car beyond its limits at the risk of others (don't care about them), so I get that speed never has a limit, people in Ferraris get bored of their rides after sometime. However what I'm pointing to is easy, steady torque.. the Santro just touches 15+ by merely leaving the clutch, the Getz was easy cruising at 80/100 at merely 1500/1800 RPM, and since it had a cast-iron engine, even at those revs one could merely hear a tiny whine and not a grunt. Hyundai cars used to be easily driveable in city which is what I loved about them, I didn't care for 2-3 kmpl lesser fuel economy. Hyundai cars today have fallen far from the apple tree, their legacy. Today their engines grunt and groan uncomfortably as it moves, their gearing is taller and hopelessly configured and peak torque is in the range of the worst engine on earth for me, the i-Vtec. I just want to caress the A-pedal with my feet and watch the car effortlessly touch the ton and cruise without a care in the world, I think only the Kona would satisfy me in that regard, because I'm sick of driving the automatics, Audi was slow (albeit much faster than mass-market automatics), VWs are slow, Ford DCT was a cruel joke and even the Elantra while it has fantastic pull from 2nd gear onwards, it still leaves me a lot to desire in the 0-60 region which is what I do 99.99% of the time. We need engines made for India, not Europe or America where one can hit triple digits by slamming the pedal to the floor and stay there for more than 10 minutes at a stretch.

Looks great from some angles and not so attractive from some other (especially the super busy rear end) * The stylish wheel caps on Sportz model actually looks better than the diamond cut alloys in Asta ! Especially on darker colours. Personal opinion though. * Interior quality is good. Fit and finish is famed Hyundai level. Though I must admit that the perceived ambience hasnt improved over the elite i20, like it did over the first gen car. Plastics are all hard. Too many styling bits. * Touchscreen system in Asta is straight from the Creta 2020. As expected works well. * Digital console is gimmicky. It isn't very information extensive to require the all digital setup. * Bose music system surprisingly didnt sound as impressive. Altroz has got a better setup. Even my Creta's Arkamys sounds bit better. * 1.2 petrol feels improved. It isnt exactly rev friendly like say a Swift 1.2 but is decent for city drive. Elite i20 petrol was anemic. This isnt. Even with 4 people onboard. Gearshift is butter smooth. Clutch is fine. 1.2 petrol is a good option to have honestly. Engine felt noiser than my Creta's 1.5 setup.

Good headroom (i am 5'11""), excellent legroom and decent underthigh support. Verna feels hilariously poor in comparison ! * Ride felt settled in the short drive.

With all due respect Sir, don't you think you are sounding a bit absurd here? As one of the most informed members in this forum, I'm sure you know how important a stable body shell is to safety along with Airbags to save the passengers in the event of an accident. Using words such as ""Crucial, important, life saving safety features that are only found in the i20"" is very much misleading, coz all those features you just mentioned becomes mere ""BLING"" when you have an UNSTABLE BODY SHELL & an UNSTABLE FOOTWELL AREA. Now I know the i20 isn't tested yet, so it can go either ways. But seeing how the expensive Seltos has fared with barely 3 stars, and lil brother i10 NIOS with just 2, we know what priority Hyundai gives to safety. So until it's tested, i20 in my sceptical mind is still very much an unsafe car. The moment this car scores better Safety rating I will agree with everything you have shared. Seeing how Hyundai has been behaving until now, we all know how that goes. Again saying other cars can only dream of ESP, TC etc.. well the Seltos has all those too and it's brakes fail to work at times and you know that thread on our forum too. Kia has failed to acknowledge or make a proper recall on the same. Priorities! So yeah, if brakes fail with all these features, these features merely become BLING. A week back one of my friend who owns the Seltos GTX was complaining the headlights seem poor in performance, I thought he was wrong, until I checked the Tbhp thread where many are complaining about the same. You can't upgrade the LED headlamps either. That's when I realised, oh there's another BLING! Seltos has so many lamps infront but still fail to illuminate the road properly means you know what the priorities are. So there you go, there's a reason why people are saying there's more BLING to Hyundai/Kia than the actual stuff. Comparison to Seltos was just to show my concerns about the brand. And please don't belittle other brands, coz Hushhh, they provide more VALUE to your as well your families LIFE at a lower cost than these Koreans. I have my respect for them. I saw many people complaining that the i20 is overpriced. But I would say the i20 is value for money provided this car had 4/5 star safety. But until proven, the i20 is overpriced and most probably UNSAFE. I know I'm sounding harsh here, but we have had enough isn't it? I was also keen on the new i20 until GNCAP results came out for other Hyundai's & Kia's. We too deserve safer cars when we pay for it. I hope I'm proven wrong and this car scores better though the chances are slim. End of rant.", 16th December 2020,hyundai-grand-i20,Cochin,106,591

First of all, massive respect for you sir after you shattered the myths related to platforms of Hyundai Cars in India but don't you think that you actually went quite over the top (that's a understatement seeing the edit and the warning from the mods under your post) in this post of yours? A quick glance on carwale.com shows that the so-called ""absolutely safe"" one sells at 8.7 and 10.13 lacs on-road Delhi (1.2P and 1.5D respectively) while the full of safety features, that are so earth shattering and Moon-high that others cannot even dream about them, sells at 10.41 and 12.62lacs on road Delhi (1.2P and 1.5D both manual), a good 1.7 and 2.49 lacs cheaper respectively. And at that price the i20 can't even dream about giving its owners a safe structure!! And please don't give me that BS that the i20 hasn't been tested blah blah blah.. For God's sake, the sister Seltos at 21lacs on road barely managed to scrape through 2 stars! For all anyone cares, we have a history of poor performing Hyundais for the 'samajhdar' or the 'wise' to guess the reality! A senior BHPian like you, at least, should not be the one belittling other brands, safe or unsafe, reliable or unreliable, desi or videshi if you can't encourage people to open up to our Indian manufacturers at least not pull 'em down. And thanks to people with their condescending narrow-minded thinking who believe anything Indian is low quality that the so-called safe one is so affordably priced and their brothers and sisters as well throughout the line-up. No wonder the foreigners are milking us Indians and our own Indian brands with competitive products are watching us getting milked. I so hope the so-called safe one with its upcoming model gets a real top-end variant to shut such negative comments, and i know even then it will be much more affordably priced, a price that suits a premium hatchback.

These indeed are crucial safety features and it is great that a car from this segment is offering them and hopefully others will follow. These should not be considered as bling or gizmos. I personally only identify following as bling : 1. Large Touch-Screens. (Soon we may see a 10-inch display in an Alto ) 2. Connected Car tech. 3. Luxuries like ventilated seats, Sunroof(may be air-purifier) etc. 4. Wireless mobile-charging.

I think the Ford Freestyle has 6 air-bags. Anyways, I am assuming you are referring to TATA Altroz. IMHO, this expression ""cannot dream of"" is not fair. Consider this. The Nexon has ESP as standard(even in base variant), and that includes : - Electronic Traction Control - Roll-over-Mitigation - Emergency Brake assist - Hill Hold Control - Electronic Brake Pre-fill - Brake Disc Wiping Source: https://cars.tatamotors.com/suv/nexon/features. Nexon even has TPMS too. If this is possible with Nexon, which is probably just half a segment above Altroz, that too with a decade-old Indica-based platform(X1 I think), then it is not unfathomable to think that the Altroz with a brand new(ALFA) platform can be added with at least some of the safety features that you have mentioned(side & curtain airbags, ESP + TC, Hill Hold, TPMS). It will be more of a business decision rather than capability that decides whether an OEM gives such features in a particular segment. As per my knowledge all future sub-4 meter TATA products(including next-gen Nexon) will be based on this ALFA platform. I understand the vehicle's platform needs to be capable of having such features. But unless there is a known limitation with any platform, it is always possible to add such safety features to a car in future. Quote: Originally Posted by RSR No, they dont!

A few bumps here and there dont really upset the composure of the car, it holds its line into corners with aplomb and as I mentioned earlier the big car feel ensures that the drive is calm and relaxed without the feeling that youre going too fast. Is it as good as my GT TSI? Well no... but its quite close. 3. I started pushing the car the moment I got off the expressway (e-way was done with cruise on 100) and I got an overall 14kmpl over the 1500 km drive which included a lot of travel within Goa as well. 4. The 1.0 GDI delivers its power in a very relaxed way. It doesnt push you back into the seat like the 1.2 TSI does but the power on tap is more than adequate to have fun with. 5. The aircon works brilliantly. The cabin was kept cool at all times and we never had to take the temperature below 22 degrees even at the lowest fan speed. 6. No aches and pains at all after the drive. I was the only one driving and had no issues whatsoever. The seats are adequately supportive. 7. I am yet to get used to the brakes. The brake feel is very different from what I am used to and hence the confidence is missing. Modulation is not very difficult but it feels like they could do with a bit more bite. 8. The car is a head turner. People doing a double take, guys pointing the car out to their friends, wives etc was common on the drive as was people coming and asking about how good the car is.

In my quest to finalise one, I've test driven the Ford EcoSport, Tata Nexon, Venue, DCT, Vitara Brezza AT and i20 turbo DCT.

There is no turbo grunt in the engine. My 10 year old i10 with TC did better. The gearshift is jerky, worse than an AMT at times. The gearbox is reluctant to downshift even when dead slow resulting in the engine lugging at low speeds. The gearbox tends to stay in the 2nd ratio.

In the 1st instance, it was Volkswagen Ameo and on the other BMW. A close friend had a Polo GT TSi and after driving that I really wanted to get a Diesel DSG and in comes the Ameo 1.5 TDI DSG. I was shocked seeing how lethargic that gearbox had and it showed similar symptoms as the i20's TD you mentioned above. The dealer forced me to check out the Vento TDi DSG when I gave them the feedback and voila! The performance was exactly how I expected furthermore, they offered me one of their executives DSG Ameo and again it was exactly how a DSG ought perform. The next up was BMW, it was a 320d and again the same issues, slow shifts, poor acceleration and higher engine noise. Furthermore, surprisingly, the car was holding gears unnecessarily even when I didn't wanted it & trust me, I vouched never to drive a F30 gain after that horrible experience and Yes! Now I own a LCI and it has been a sheer bliss! Please take a TD of a car at some other dealership, I am sure you drove a car which had some unsorted issues. Furthermore, even VW guys had said & I somewhat agree to them, these hatchback and CS ATs are highly driven due to the frequent TDs of different customers and all have their own way of driving moreover there are several customers who has recently forayed into the segment and are often driving an AT for the first time which results in major abuse of transmission.

Since I'm not very used to driving automatics, I took my time to familiarise and respond to the DCT. Likes: 1. Extremely smooth to drive 2. Telescopic and Tilt steering + good seats - easy to find a perfect driving position 3. Digital instrument cluster, something i usually hate, is designed so well. Very easy to read 4. Turbo petrol in S/ Manual mode was thrilling! 5. Cabin refinement, especially for a 3 cylinder engine 6. Audio qualtiy was really good! 7. Steering feels way better compared to the prev-gen i20 8. Gear ratios are spaced beautifully and power is always available in the S or Manual Mode Dislikes: 1. DSG is quite jerky in D mode in the lower revs. 2. D mode shifts very soon and the turbo lag was super irritating! I loved using the S mode where the revs were mostly above 2k rpm 3. Lag in throttle response in D - maybe also magnified with the turbo lag. 4. Price - super expensive! 5. Crash rating (rather the lack of it) and general concerns reg. the same with Hyundai/ Kia 6. Interiors, though well appointed, felt a bit too plasticky to my liking I have mentioned only the most important aspects I observed during the test drive as all the general positives and negatives have already been mentioned in plenty. I have to say the sunroof really did not make a big impression. As a driver, my head is always ahead of the sunroof and though it may increase the cabin brightness, I really felt not much of a difference as I'm anyways facing the bright road ahead. Maybe as a rear passenger it might make a difference. So I realised Sun-roof will never be a deal-breaker for me. Overall, the car felt amazing with good space and being super easy to drive.

322, Potenza , 23:02 ,BHPian,Ok so the i20 threw up its first problem around a month back. The request sensor stopped working and I had to lock/unlock the car from the remote only. The weird part was that the while the sensor didnt work while locking/unlocking it did produce a beep when the sensor was pressed while the door was open. This told me that the sensor was working and the problem lay somewhere else. The workshop however had different ideas. They replaced the door handle under warranty a couple of days back and now even the new handle is working only intermittently. It has a mind of its own. It works perfectly sometimes and doesnt work at all on other occasions (this is exactly how the problem originated the first time).

Most people are comparing the performance of the 1.0 GDi with that of the TSI engined Polo and saying that its no match. As a former Polo GT TSI owner (sold my car last month) I was able to compare literally back to back and as Ive mentioned earlier the Hyundai is definitely a more sedate performer as compared to VWs 1.2 TSI. The Hyundai will never push you back in the seat the way a Polo does but having said that its got a meatier mid range vs the 1.2 TSI. The car pulls strongly from around 2k rpm all the way to around 5k after which the power starts tapering off. I usually drive in D so it shifts around the 3-3500 rpm mark.

In the GNCAP, a body shell integrity of unstable means that further loading is not possible. That aspect is not measured/tested in the Euro ncap. Looking at the protection chart of the swift in Europe vs India, I don't see a major difference. However with Kia Seltos, that is clearly not the case. In my opinion, some of us are reducing the gravity of what Kia/Hyundai (the parent) have done for their 20 lakh car by suggesting that others (including Maruti & Ford) have also been doing this. I feel for the Seltos owners and hope that Hyundai will test India Creta and i20 to put the doubts at rest.

To give you an idea of my usage, I'm a retired Navy guy and have done 83000 km in the 12 years that I had my Dzire. Our requirements were wide serivce network (used the Extensive Maruti network in small places many a time), hatchback (since our children have gone away we are generally only 2 with not much luggage), plush interiors (negligible cabin noise and premium feel), ABS, and good infotainment system. Saw i20, Jazz, Baleno, took a peek at Sonet, Venue. Wife and I liked the i20, so booked a TD (on 24th) and was impressed by the quality of ride, engine and features. Read all the 22 pages of reviews on Team-BHP and settled for the i20. Since there were a plethora of variants, zeroed down on the 1.0 turbo Asta but this was not available through the CSD, so went in for the Sportz variant thereby losing out the Electronic stability control. Booked the car on 23rd, sold my Dzire on 24th, and got delivery of this beauty on 31st. Loved the ""styled Steel"" wheels I wonder if they had made such an effort to make the steel wheels so sleek to fit behind the plastic covers, could they not have just painted them grey/black and fitted them as such?

At idle. The 3-cylinder engine is quite noisy when idling, especially during cold starts in the morning, however it settles down after a few kms once the engine has warmed up. Cabin is pretty insulated from any harshness of the 3-cylinder thrum noise or vibrations. It doesn't have any further impact when the AC is turned on either. Having said that, at city and cruising speeds, there are absolutely no engine noise and vibrations felt in the cabin.

384, goandude , 16:27 ,Senior - BHPian,"This is a short review of my i20 Sportz 1.0 turbo IMT bought on 31 March 21 and driven about 2k kms till now with a mix of city and highway drives including ghats. To understand my views, know that i have been driving Swift Dzire VDI for last 12 years and did 80k km in it, mostly highway runs. Im a sedate driver and its usually only just two of us in the car, me and my Speed Governor, who I married 30+ years ago. My requirements were a comfortable hatch with a quiet cabin, powerful engine, automatic or clutchless transmission, light on the pocket to run and have extensive service network. The car is a well rounded machine for both daily run about as well as highway. It has the pulling power to take 4 adults comfortably, NVH is great so that I can enjoy the music from the excellent Arkamys 4 speaker sound system while travelling on the highway at 80 to 90 kmph. Faster than this the wind noise tends to creep into the cabin. The head unit is a breeze to handle navigation, music, phone calls and it pairs wirelessly with my Realme 7 running Android 11, in about 15 seconds. Visibility all round is good but the rear visibility is hampered by any stuff you put on the parcel shelf. The rear camera can be slaved to the HU while driving but this is not very useful due to its very wide angle lens and distortion of distance. Its great for parking though and you can reverse right till your bumper nearly touches the limit. Rear ORVMs are internally adjustable and foldable. My use has been to lower the Left side mirror to be able to see the curb and my rear wheel while reversing as close to the curb as possible. The windscreen reflects light off the dashboard which is distracting. Ergonomics are good, with horizontal and vertical adjustability of the seat and rake and reach of the steering one can find an ideal driving position. But one grouse is the arm rest. Its practically useless as my elbow cant rest on it while holding the steering. And just the tip of my elbow can rest on it with my hand on the gear shift. The leatherette contoured seats are comfortable for long drives but it does get hot and sweaty in warm weather. I cant comment much on the driving dynamics of the car since I have not pushed it to its limits but on hairpin bends and on hard braking she handles well without too much body roll/dive. Haven't had the ABS cut in so far. On start up the engine idles at 1.3 k and settles down to 8 k on warming up after which I can hardly feel the engine vibrations or sound in the cabin. Power is deficient under 1.5 k but its not like the DDIS engine with its dead feel below 1.8k and powerful surge after that. Here the lag as well as the surge of power is not as acutely felt, in other words smoother power delivery with the engine coming into the power band after 1.8 k. The MID suggests shifting at 2k in all gears and this is fine in city and gives good FE but on highway I generally shift up at 2.5 or so. At 80 kmph engine is at 1.8 RPM in top gear, 2.2 in 5th, 2.7 in 4th. Sixth gear is good for cruising at a steady speed but there is very slow acceleration in this gear. Engine breaking is not as strong as the DDIS engine. AC doesnt cause appreciable difference to the engine power. The IMT transmission is great, it took me some time to get used to it but my left leg thanks me in B to B traffic. The creep forward function at 1st and 2nd gear is a boon in traffic. One issue I found, is for example joining a main road from a side road which is on an incline, if you give it too much throttle the car will jump onto the main road, which is dangerous. One has to get used to the amount of throttle input required on slopes. The other thing is that there is a very slight lag from the time you depress the throttle to the time the car responds. This is important when starting off from an incline on a hill where you have to release the brake or hand brake to move forward. You have to allow for this small lag. The suspension is firm but not harsh or uncomfortable (like Swift Dzire with 15 wheels), nor is it plush (like Verna on 16 wheels). It soaks up bumps on broken roads quite well. However, on speed breakers around my place which I am so familiar with, I have to cross them at much lower speeds than my Dzire, otherwise there is a resounding THUD when the suspension extends to its max limit after crossing the speed bumps. I changed stock steel wheels to gun metal grey alloys, OE of Verna SX, as they are of exact same dimensions but weigh 2 kgs less. The car gives me a FE of 20+ kmpl on highway and around 15 in the city. I switch off at traffic lights more than 30 seconds and rarely cross 2k RPM. MID average reads less than tank to tank method by about 5%. AC drops FE by 2 kmpl on highway. Other niggles worth mentioning are only a single horn is present, it is adequate but not nice sounding. If headlights are not in AUTO mode, it keeps beeping, reminding you to switch on lights if there is overcast conditions or passing under metro station. The paint job inside the engine bay and in the boot is not good. There is no anti theft alarm; that is the car doesnt raise an alarm if you disturb it while it is locked. TPMS is quite accurate and shows increase in pressure of 2/3 psi after driving 20 odd kms. Opening the boot from inside is not possible, so in case of mall security check, either you get out of the car to open it or the security man needs to feel for a small nipple under the boot lit and press it, not very easy to do. Like I mentioned in an earlier post, the spare wheel can be filled with air only after taking it out as it is placed upside down. Overall, I am quite happy with the car. It suits my requirements well and I especially like the way it looks from the front and sides but not particularly from the rear. OTOH the front grill is a nightmare to keep clean with all the diamond shapes it has.", 25th July 2021,hyundai-grand-i20,Mysuru,"1,755","1,274"

Or am i still better off with 1.2 petrol? Ten thousand kilometers per annum is decent running, mine is about 8k and still I find diesel useful. That apart, yes, the 1.2 litre engine is not only underpowered for cars the size of i20, it is also tuned in a way that power is felt only post 2k rpm, you need to test drive one asap to know how it feels to you personally. The 1.5 diesel in manual will be fun though, you can play with the gearing and feel the surge all the way from 1500 to 3000 rpm. It'll also fetch better resale for sure. My opinion would be to take a long test drive of the petrol 1.2 and then decide, sometimes what is underpowered for one would be the sweet spot for the other. Hyundai in a bid to improve efficiency and longevity, has killed the torque in its petrol engines, because the 1.1 Santro engine and the 1.3 Getz petrol engines were a breeze to drive due to good torque supply from 1200 rpm itself, those days are long gone.", 2nd August 2021,hyundai-grand-i20,Beans,"1,847","8,351"

The drive quality is really good! It was stable even at a 100kmph. The automatic is really smooth but not one for quick shifts, good at linear power delivery. Power is lacking.

If you like a calm and relaxed ride then and only then will the 1.2L suffice. I don't regret going for the IVT as it fulfils my requirements perfectly.

Sonet for features XUV300 for performace Nexon as a very good allrounder if you want everything I agree with your views and below is what compelled us to go for venue. 1.Space was never an issue as most of the times my parents will travel alone. 2.Dashboard layout is much cleaner in Venue than others. 3.We got a better deal with Venue and it costed us 13.06 OTR Punjab with a 15 days waiting time and this includes SOT and extended warranty and Insurance as well.The vehicle is manufactured in OCT,21 so its fresh out of the oven 4.The dealership and service center is 500 metres from our home. 5.Venue has comparatively less stiffer ride than Sonet. 6.The HU in sonet kind of hinders the vision as it elevates above the dashboard. 7.Xuv and Nexon didnt have a proper AT . 8.Sonet had a wait time of 3 months. 9.SX+ model had all the bells and whistles dad was looking for.It didnt have 6 airbags which is a pity but then cant do much there. 10.Our previous ride was a Honda city which has scrapped everywhere so higher GC was the top priority. 11. VENUE has been tested although a different model in Australia which gives some sense of relief as against Sonet which hasnt been tested anywhere.Please correct me if i am wrong. 12.I own a Creta 1st gen and i am a happy customer so a bias descision was somewhat expected . 13.

Some other changes seen: Fuel Tank capacity in my car (i20 IMT Sportz) is stated as 37 liters while the Euro ones are stated to be 40 liter. I tend to believe that my tank is also 40 liters.

For me only consideration is Hyundai, i am trying to limit to 11 lacs budget (more to do with how much to spend on hatchback) Would like views/owners response or suggestions on the 1.2 CVT variant based on below requirements - City driving only (approx. 8k a year) - No road trips expected on this car - Automatic must can be either CVT or DCT I am also keen on Venue cause in all likelihood the 11 Lacs limit will be busted so does it make sense to buy it near a generation change.

416, pallav167 , 13:42 ,Newbie,"Hello Bhpians, I have a question that is bothering me for a few weeks. It is related to my confusion on which of the available engine options in i20 should I go for. Just to give you a little background about my car ownership so far. I currently own a 2.5 years old Kia Seltos (1.5L Petrol manual) purchased in Sept 2020 and a 12 year old 2010 Model i10 (1.1L Manual). My first car was a second-hand Maruti Esteem purchased in 2008, kept it for 2 years before I bought i10 in 2010. Immediately after we bought Seltos, the covid thing occurred and hence the car only managed 12000 Kms in 2.5 years. The i10 is mostly driven by my wife these days but during Covid WFM, I have also used it quite frequently. I just love the maneuverability of a small car over Seltos in city traffic and that’s one of the reasons I am looking for a modern-day city beater. Another and more important reason is that the car lease of my Seltos is getting over in a few months and I am now looking for another car to utilize the tax benefits of a leased car. I am not in need of a new car but as mentioned, I want to utilize the Car Lease policy of my company. But to be honest, I have given my heart to the new i20 and that’s the most important reason fot this consideration. It looks simply amazing in starry night color. I am planning to part with my i10 although it has only been driven 65000 Kms in the last 12 years. The car still runs like a charm and could easily serve till the end of it's legitimate cycle of 15 years without any fuss. The ownership experience of my i10 has been very smooth and since it is less driven, I haven’t pocketed any big bills on Services and parts replacement in last 12 years of ownership. I have a budget of up to 10 lacs, and I am confused between three engine options: Spotrz CVT (1.2 litre) Sportz iMT (1litre Turbo) Sportz Manual (1.2 litre) My only requirement is hassle-free low-cost ownership just like my current i10. I also don't want to pay exorbitant service bills and need a decent fuel economy since car will be mainly used for small city runs. I have never owned an automatic and my wife and I both love manual. But since this is going to be a city commuter and I am also looking to try something more contemporary, so I am open to automatic as well although still not heavily inclined towards it. I am apprehensive of a few things and if they come out to be true, I will happily go for a naturally aspirated Sportz 1.2 manual: I am seeking answers for the below points from this highly experienced group: 1> Does Turbo engines requires higher maintenance cost (in the longer run) as compared to the naturally aspirated ones? I heard that there are chances of turbo failure in the longer run? 2> How is the long-term reliability of iMT? Does it have higher maintenance cost (Service+ part failures) as compared to manual ones? 3> How much will be the approx. the difference in fuel efficiency between iMT and CVT as compared to manual ones? Is it negligible or considerable? 4> How much is the difference in fuel efficiency between Turbo and naturally aspirated engines? Is it almost negligible? I know I am asking for too many details, but since I have always owned naturally aspirated petrol cars, I am not very confident about the upkeeps of Turbo and Automatics. Also, since I already have a Seltos, I am not looking for a low mileage/ high maintenance car as it will only be driven 200-300 kms / month max. So not very keen to spend much on something that will be parked in the garage most of the time. I am looking for the suggestions of the rookie Team Bhpians as it will help me in taking a better-informed decision. Another thing I want to mention is that I am only considering i20 and no other car, purely for it's front looks and sharp fit and finish. Having owned an i10 and Seltos, I am naturally more at ease with Hyundai cars. Thanks, Pallav", 26th January 2022,hyundai-grand-i20,NOIDA,14,34

Thanks, Pallav To answer some of your questions, if you have never driven an automatic, I will definitely recommend having one in the garage and you will find yourself driving it more than any other car. To the best if my knowledge turbo should not have any higher maintenance than the regular 1.2 IVT. Same goes for IMT I dont see maintenance being radically different in of these cars. DCT maintenance IMO can get tricky if it breaks. Again, fuel efficiency given 200-300 km range will be negligible so thats also not a factor. I would suggest for a cost conscious purchase go for IVT, DCT is better but IMO turbo DCT i20 is very bad and laggy. Also, IVT is cheaper I myself am in the market for small car for wife, test drove i20 DCT N8 but hated the turbo lag so much that looking at downgrading to 1.2 IVT.

Thanks, Pallav I suggest drive both the CVT and the iMT - the CVT is the 'more normal' automatic and the iMT is an acquired taste for most folks (the latter being new) The Turbo will be more FTD but the fuel efficiency will be dependent on the driving style (more sensitive) while the CVT will be the one to have in back-to-back traffic scenarios. (But will likely return consistent fuel efficiency numbers) Switching between the CVT and your MT Seltos may be an easier ask as compared to iMT <-> MT (one may go for changing gears without depressing the clutch) Since you will be in for a long ownership, go for something that appeals most to you from a overall comfort and drive perspective.", 29th January 2022,hyundai-grand-i20,Bangalore,253,315

After about 6 months while driving my wife's new Ford Figo MT, I often forgot to press the C pedal with not so nice consequences. But after a few 100 KMS this response quickly faded.

I contacted Hyundai to get some clarity since Sportz iMT still showed up on Click 2 Buy and on their official brochure and web site.

I happened on a trail of recent hatchbacks reviews. Had my father not enquired for a test drive? We would not have this lovely car sitting in our driveway. A day after the enquiry, two gentleman with mask encompassing their face from us came to render their assistance. Father shook his head, raised his eyebrows and displayed his unearthing with perfect movement of hands, son the front facia is not as high as my friends i20, he is referring here to the second generation. I confessed I did like it. Now shall I enlighten you about the wisdom of rest of the family members, as this is the secret that led to further movements. Women-folk expressed sympathy towards the space at the rear bench. I gathered that the car dimension was tailor made for the parking space. Amidst the twittering wits, we rolled for the test-drive. On the rude tarmac beneath we gild along in tranquility. With five aboard, the reluctance to move was not identified. For My Sales Advisor and I are of the same cloth, when it comes to hasten the process. To my immense joy, I came to know that a model of my liking is on its way to their yard. So as it went, I booked the car via Click To Buy as per request by the dealer. On 06 of February 2022, in the board day light visited their yard to do the PDI. The car had just been unloaded from the carrier and the odometer read 16 KM. I crossed at length, the many checklist in the Team-bhp shared document. And then came the delivery day, accompanying my sister and nephew, reached at 4 PM, 5 days later. Permit me to elucidate the luke warm delivery procedure. The car though cleaned had grease at certain spots. Dealer's only concern was to adhere to the delivery checklist supplied by Hyundai India and hence every action felt like being acted, devoid of human courtsey. To my dismay, the odometer fuse was kept aside to be fitted at delivery time. There were having tough time removing ""SHIP"" mode which I observed in the MID. Observations - 1. It happened only once, the gear shift knob jerked from 1st to neutral at the time of start. 2. The seats are comfortable and wide. 3. Power is sufficient for 5 onboard. 4. One has to slow down at speed bumps and large pot holes, otherwise a reverberating thud is endowed upon. 5. Muds and dirt accumulate at the space in the font of rear wheel wells. 6. There is no anti theft alarm. 7. The default speakers are quite good, bluetooth is quick to pair with. The tactile controls on DIN and steering wheel is a welcome feature. 8. The Headlight throw is inadequate for unlit roads. I had to turn on fog lamps to compensate for on few occasions. 9.

444, kaustubhp , 11:54 ,BHPian,"Cruise Control is hardly of any use on busy highways. I did a 1200 km trip, 2 side from Delhi to Udaipur. I engaged Cruise Control but it barely lasted for 5-7mins. Also, there is some sense of discomfort when I put both my legs down. I fear when if and when I try to press brakes, I may not place them accurately/fully on the brake pedal and may instead press accelerator or partly so. So I put my right leg very gently on the brake pedal. I guess that is the right way to do it. Not sure.

479, #drivingFreak , 08:02 ,Newbie,"The 3rd gen i20 launched in India in 2020 with a completely new design and various engine and gearbox options. We were one of the first customers of this car back in December 2020, and our i20 has done over 30k km till the present day. Design - Exteriors and Interiors Ours is the Sportz variant with ivt gearbox. This is my father's daily driver, and I drive this when I come home during college breaks. I wasn't a fan of the looks of the car when it launched, but I have grown a liking for it since it entered our garage. Because it is the Sportz variant, the car comes with halogen headlamps, and I feel that it spoils the looks of the car a bit. The design of the car is busy but doesn't bother me much. It has a low slung stance, and I feel it would have looked even better if it was a little closer to the ground, but that would have hampered the practicality, so can't really complain. Overall I love the design, and it has grown on me so much that people around me always find me staring at any i20 passing by. I must say, this car is a rare sight compared to the previous-gen i20. The car's interiors looked very plasticky when I first saw them in the videos, and it is true, but they don't feel bad in person at all. The dashboard has a nice texture to it. The handrest is soft-touch plastic, and I wish it was the same for the doors where you rest your elbows, but not exactly a deal-breaker. The layout itself is good. The 8"" touchscreen comes with wireless android auto and apple car play, physical buttons, and is slightly tilted towards the driver. The manual AC controls don't feel cheap. The four-spoke steering feels good to hold onto and looks nice on the eyes, though its size could have been a bit smaller. The car comes with all-black interiors, but the air conditioner is strong and cools the cabin quickly. Overall the interiors have a nice premium feel to them. The space inside is ample. There is good shoulder room between the driver and the front passenger. I have limited experience of the rear seat as I am generally the one driving, but from what I have experienced, the seats at the rear have good legroom, but thigh support is a bit lacking for me(I am almost 6 feet). Driving experience (In the initial days) The car is powered by a 1.2 l NA 4 cylinder engine that makes 85 hp and 113Nm of torque, and this goes to the wheels through an IVT gearbox that is basically a CVT gearbox in Hyundai's language. If I were to describe the performance briefly, I would say it is smooth and adequate. The engine delivers the power in a very linear manner. The driving experience is smooth as long as you drive with a light foot. Put the gearbox in D mode, foot off the brakes, and the car moves forward at a crawling speed that is helpful in bumper to bumper traffic. I noticed a few times that the car is not very responsive to light throttle inputs and suddenly accelerates if you apply a little more pressure on the gas pedal when crawling. This could catch you off guard sometimes when parking or reversing. Honestly, I was a little disappointed, when I first heard that Dad was getting this car from his company. I had driven the Innova Crysta, Mahindra Scorpio, Honda Mobilio and the Toyota Corolla Altis before our i20, all diesel-powered and manual, and it's fair to say that I was addicted to the torque rush of the diesel engines. I always kept the gearbox in sports mode because I had this mental block that the car was underpowered, but things got better as I spent more time behind the wheel and got acquainted with the way it delivers its performance. I observed that the more I tried to push the car more I was disappointed. The rubber-band effect is not very pronounced if you drive with a light foot, which I didn't do in the initial days. Press hard on the accelerator pedal, and the revs will rise up, the engine that is otherwise very silent will sound louder, but the car itself won't make any progress. I remember a drive from Panaji to Netravali in Goa that involved some beautiful curvy roads. I was pushing the car with hard acceleration, only to be disappointed. My dad in the passenger seat, who obviously has had more experience with the car, suggested driving with a light foot, and to my surprise, I enjoyed doing that on our return drive. I was doing good speeds through the corners. It's just that I was getting to that speeds a little slower and in a more calm manner. The engine felt relaxed and was hardly audible in the car with the music off. Dad observed me enjoying the drive, and said ""told you so"" but in a friendly manner. After all, I wasn't making a hole in his pocket by wasting fuel due to unnecessary acceleration. Driving experience part-2 I am writing this section after recently completing an almost 2000km road trip involving the scenic route of Chorla ghat, four-lane National highways, two-lane state highways and the highly unruly traffic of Pune city. We were four people in the car for the onward journey and five people for the return journey, with a week's worth of luggage. First, let's talk about the good things. The rear suspension was a little bogged down due to the weight in the rear, but that gave the car an even better stance. The boot is big enough to accommodate all our luggage and a few extra things. I was expecting the performance of the car to be disappointing in the ghats, but that wasn't the case. Yes, it takes its own sweet time to get up to speeds but doesn't feel strained at any point in time. The ground clearance too was never an issue during the whole trip. The car feels planted at high speeds until the road is smooth and there are minimum undulations. The potholes aren't felt inside, but the suspensions do make a thud sound if taken at high speeds through sharp potholes. High-speed stability is good enough for most occasions, but the car tends to lose its composure on sharp undulations. I tried doing speeds above 110kmph, but the steering felt unnervingly light, which I guess was due to the extra weight at the rear. Mash the throttle for a quick overtake, and the gearbox takes about a second to get the car in its powerband, after which the things are smooth, but still need some planning. The car is at its best at speeds between 80-100kmph. Also, let me add that the engine sounds sporty when revved above 3000rpm, which is fun sometimes. The city driving is this car's forte. The car crawls ahead slowly after lifting off the breaks. It has enough grunt lower down the rev range to close the traffic gaps. The IVT gearbox ensures that your left foot is well-rested. You don't feel a single jerk during gear shifts. Overall the experience is extremely smooth. Coming to the negative part. First has to be the brakes. The car comes with discs at the front and drum brakes at the rear. The stopping power is just about adequate, but they lack the bite. There have been instances where I felt like the car wasn't even slowing down. A couple of months back, I test drove the Skoda Slavia, and it has a strong braking bite that gives massive confidence to push the car. Since then I have been finding the brakes of our i20 inadequate. My father thinks the brakes are fine, but I asked him to get the brakes checked during the last service, and the service people said that there was no issue with the brakes. Engine braking or the lack of it is another negative point I observed, especially on downward slopes. I started using engine braking extensively on highways and ghats since I read about its benefits on Team-bhp. There is zero engine braking on the slopes. It's as if the car is unable to detect that it's going downward. On the highways, I used to put the gearbox in S mode or downshift by a couple of ratios to get maximum engine braking, and it did help. Same thing while driving in the ghats. The 3-4 ratio worked well enough for me on the downward slopes. Now, heading to the most important question in an Indian buyer's mind, Kitna deti hai? The answer to this could be a deal-breaker for many. The car gives an average mileage of 11-12 on the roads of Goa, which rarely have bumper to bumper traffic. Even worse is the mileage that I got on the highways. I saw an average fuel economy of 13.9 kmpl during my recent trip on the roads I talked about earlier. This figure wouldn't have hurt if the car was powerful, but that isn't the case either. I agree that I drive with a heavy foot, but my dad who is a light foot driver was able to extract a max of 16kmpl on his last trip to Pune. Even he agrees that the car has a bad drinking habit. Given his high running, the fuel bills have been extravagant. I tried adjusting my driving style on our return trip from Pune to Belgaum, which showed an average fuel economy of almost 14.9 kmpl. Regardless of the bad points, I love driving our i20. Yes, it's not the best performer of all the cars I have driven, but it's the one I have driven the most. It's spacious, it's practical, it's loaded with enough features, and it's not exactly boring to drive. Rather, it can be fun in the corners if you maintain enough momentum. The engine grunt is not enough to give you a push back in the seat, but it's enough to give your family a comfortable drive to the destination. The deal-breakers and they are major ones, are its mileage and the safety. I feel it's best for people who have limited driving and that too mostly in city limits. It can handle occasional highway trips though. The three-star safety ratings are also a huge disappointment for a car that is otherwise a very good package of interior space, engine and gearbox options and features. I guess it's the personal connection I have formed over time that doesn't allow me to hate this car despite its shortcomings or maybe it is a good package after all.

481, derick , 07:47 ,Newbie,"Hello fellow BHpians Previously I had posted about my 10 year old ertiga and my hunt for a new car. I thank everyone who took the time to read my post and give their valuable suggestions. I will admit that I had made a decision and booked an i20 Asta(o) vtvt MT in the colour ""Starry Night"" but I wanted to read suggestions from other people and post a buying experience separately. Inserting pictures in between. What made me book the i20 Honestly, there is no perfect car for everyone but I think you have to find your requirements and whatever ticks those boxes is the perfect car for you. Having driven almost all cars around my budget the i20 met my needs well. The top most requirement was that I needed a relaxed driving experience which cocoons me when I drive back home after a long day at work. The i20 is the smoothest, it cocoons me extremely well and oh that Bose sound system! Yes its a little expensive but you do notice where all the extra money has gone, the price finally justifies. You may skip the dealer section if you don't need drama. Dealing with the Dealer On 12th March, 2022 I booked my car with 21,000/- at Koncept Hyundai, Green Park New Delhi. The price quoted was with no discounts and a pretty high insurance amount. I knew I wanted the insurance offered by the dealer even if I had to pay extra. The final amount quoted was 10,63,138/- including a full cover insurance of 41,200. No added warranty and no basic kit. This would be the biggest transaction of my life. The promised delivery was in two months i.e 12th May, 2022. And the wait began. I read many buying experiences here in Team BHP and was expecting regular updates of my car getting manufactured, pictures etc. But any time I got updates was when I called. In mid April I got a call from my SA stating the same car is available with another dealer which they will exchange and my delivery could be within a week. I got super excited and proceeded to ship my car to my parents. A week later I had sent my car and there was no sign of my new car. My SA called me and was asking for payment to which I requested to see the car in person and take the check by hand. Few days later he informed me that the car had dents so they didn't accept it. This was a little alarming to me, what if I had paid him before seeing the car? Would my money be stuck with the dealer? Having sent my car, I was facing a lot of inconvenience traveling work everyday, thankfully my sister was kind enough to offer me her car. Late April I was getting a little frustrated since my SA wasn't picking my phone, I went to the dealership and requested to be assigned someone else, I was assigned my SAs team lead who promised me 5th May as my delivery date. Soon the 5th passed, I was pretty anxious on the inside but wasn't pushing the dealer since the actual date was the 12th. Sidenote: had my delivery been on the 5th I wouldn't end up paying 5k extra of the revised price. Once the 12th passed I got a little mad, partially fueled because I had to give my sisters car back two weeks back and Delhi's heat waves were relentless and hailing cabs was a huge inconvenience. On the other side you must have seen many videos of youtubers getting their cars within a day or two because mere contact mein koi hain I was skeptical if the dealer was making other customers jump the queue. On a late night with no delivery date promised I started looking for any hyundai email ids I could find and wrote a loooooong email with all receipts. The next day I think all Hyundai employees took turns calling me and helping me sort the problem. Maybe now I was back on the queue, I was promised my delivery on the coming weekend. I could pay whenever and however I like. I was given a stockyard inspection with pickup and drop from my work! My SA was pretty apologetic, and me being a young professional I know how hard things can be at work and I definitely didn't want to be the reason for someone's career setback, my SA would be around my age and I made sure any complaints raised against him were removed. Delivery After the email, in my mind things got a little uncomfortable between the dealer and me, which obviously I didn't want to be. Thankfully the SA made the delivery very smooth, I had made the payment a day before since I had the chassis no. I got a huge bouquet, some chocolates and keychains. When I was booking the car I had told the SA I will take Mats for free! And I did. Sadly I took the delivery all alone, my parents and sister stay in different citie and, all my friends were out of town. I had to sign a few forms regarding the email and got a few phone calls, gave maximum ratings, no complaints anymore, I got my car. It is no surprise few customers are jumping queues, dealers are offering accessory loaded vehicles for early deliveries and customers are willing to pay extra. The balances have changed and so have dealings. In the end honest customers suffer who cant afford to spend a penny more and are made to wait longer since people are skipping ahead. I think I should have written the email on the 13th, had I kept silent no way would I have gotten my delivery on the 22nd. Having said so, my dealer never asked for extra money or pushed me to buy accessories. He was even fine with getting insurance from elsewhere. Starry night on a rainy night First impressions Shes an attention seeking wh******* said my colleague. This car was launched 2 years back, but you hardly spot one on the road and everybody stares at it when it passes by. Sure some of them think it's ugly but I think it's like an iphone. It looks ugly at first but the more you look at it the better it looks. A week later she's the most gorgeous thing I have seen. Pros -There's nothing like this on the road, its small on the outside but huge on the inside. -I like how deep seated you are in the driver seat, and the car sticks to the road especially on corners. -The dashboard is years ahead in comparison, digital cluster, huge infotainment screen, steering feels very nice. The car feels segments above, the cluster is from the verna, the infotainment and steering is from the creta. Pictures don't justify the interiors. -The Bose sound system is the best. period. Tatas JBL is nowhere near including the 8 speakers in nexon which gains a lot of pitch in higher volumes. The woofer and amplifier makes the entire car a subwoofer. -NVH levels are close to nil, I hear my engine at ignition that's it. -Love the sharp design, leds in the front and back make it stand out. -The ability to cool the car remotely is very convenient in this heat. The AC is very strong and cools the cabin very quickly. -Unlike the tatas, cruisecontrol is seamless and works well even in city speeds. -Fewer i20s on road means you stand out of all the cretas, seltos and balenos. The interiors are ""lit"" at night literally Some unique features I noticed: -I like how the auto headlights and puddle lamps light up when you unlock the car, a real showoff. -The wireless charger is very convenient. Once I put my phone in the slot it auto connects the bluetooth and starts playing the music (or maybe this is a feature in my phone). It is also a fast charger with cooling so the charging is pretty quick -The navigation separately shows which exit/lane to take with a picture and the voice commands are almost always accurate. You can also set a destination on the bluelink app and send it to the car beforehand so you dont have to fiddle with the onscreen keyboard in the infotainment screen. I wish I could share locations from google maps to the bluelink. lights at night Cons: -No leather seats, I don't know if its safe to use those cut out aftermarket leather seats on airbag seats. -Apparently the car is supposed to speak out a welcome message when you sit inside, that has happened only once. -You can remote start the car only when it is in neutral, plane surface and no handbrakes. It's hard for me to trust my car won't roll. This feature would be enabled with handbrake. -Unless you cross 20 the seatbelt chime doesn't start, I feel it should start beeping once driving starts because it can be distracting to put on the seatbelt after you have started. -The car seems to be very well damped, door needs to be closed a little harder. I noticed if a window/sunroof is opened it closes softly. -The seats are a little too firm, maybe it will help in long drives, it could also have some better side bolstering for that huggy feel. Suggestions: -Should I go for leather seats with cutouts for the airbag I also went to detailing bull in promenade Vasant Kunj. They have quoted 80k for ppf, 25k for ceramic and 5k for bumper ppf. I haven't heard any positives for ceramics but i'm considering getting ppf in both bumpers, especially the front. Also the 80k for full ppf seems to be on a higher side. -How effective are GPS devices, most devices are installed behind the dash, Im sure burglars have that update. Conclusion I love my car, I love how striking it looks. It has so many convenience features, everything feels plush to touch and it gives that relaxing drive I was looking for. I find myself constantly updating my playlist so I can enjoy that Bose sound system. This is my first car ever and I am so proud to own it, I am hoping to keep this car as long as I can.

Tata Nexon - didn't like the bumpy ride as i feel nauseated if ride is bumpy, safety is important but if its so bumpy in city traffic, people would think twice before sitting in the car. 2. Honda Jazz CVT - Very Good Car and similar to i20, but the SA was not all interested in sales and fully occupied with Whatsapp chats and not giving proper response. 3. Honda Amaze - same as above. 4. Skoda Rapid - Excellent Choice, I would've picked it but as its at the end of its lifecycle, avoided it. 5. i20 IMT - absolutely loved the IMT transmission, its so easy to use and makes driving very relaxed and comfortable on both highways and city conditions.

Another irritant is when driving against the sun, windshield reflections affect visibility to a large extent. Anyone else feel this? And any remedy like the felt type cloth cover? There is this disconcerting ""thud"" when going over speed breakers at a slightly higher speed, when the front suspension reaches its limit of extension. So have to take the speed breakers real slow... Could Hyundai improve on the vehicle?

My city traffic running will also be low ~ 3-4k kms in a year) The following models of i20 are in my budget: 1. i20 Sportz IMT: 2 dealerships have refused to take booking for this model as they claim Hyundai have stopped manufacturing this variant as its very similar to the Nline N6 variant. Hence, no choice but to let go of this option. 2. Nline N6 imt: I have made a booking for this variant yesterday (6th June), dealer has 1 vehicle in stock as of now and has assured that they can supply fresh cars as well within 1-2 months. Love everything about the Nline N6 variant but it's still not a dct. 3. I20 Sportz DCT: This is the model which I am interested in and multiple dealers have told me that the supply for this model from Hyundai is erratic and they cannot commit about the waiting period. Supposedly, a few customers have booked in the past and cancelled their booking after 2 months as there was no sign of car dispatch from the factory. However, the dealers are ready to take bookings for the same, with one of the 'guaranteeing' delivery within 2 months.

508, TwerkyC0ffee , 15:43 ,BHPian,Hi fellow members and owners - need a couple of confirmations regarding i20 diesel. 1. Is the diesel engine turbo or non turbo? Went to check out the i20 at a dealer today and the SA mentioned it is NOT a turbo diesel. 2. Is it the same engine that comes in the Venue diesel? There’s a requirement for a new car at home and it will be running 170kms everyday (highways only) - what fuel efficiency can we expect from the i20 under these circumstances? Does it have enough power to make quick overtakes? Looking forward to your responses. Thanks in advance., 6th August 2022,hyundai-grand-i20,UP78,88,222

The Diesel in the i20 comes with a Waste Gate Turbocharger, the same as in the Venue and Sonet Manual putting out 100 PS of power and 240 Nm of torque. The Sonet automatic however has a Variable Geometry Turbocharger, the same as in the Seltos and the Creta putting out 115 PS of power and 250 Nm of torque.

While they offered a 25k discount initially, the minute I said I Ill buy my own insurance, the discount dropped to first 14k and then to 10k! Is this a normal practice? They say this a dealer discount and they cant go further down as there are no offers from Hyundai. Their quote for 58k is almost 4x of what Im finding online for ~15k since I dont need all the bells and whistles. So even if I let go the 15k of additional discount, I still save about 30k. 2. As per online portals like Car Dekho, there is 3k drop in registration cost the minute you book the car in your companys name instead of your personal name. The dealer says there is no difference in registration cost between individuals and companies. Is this correct?

One week later, the car is finally mine. Now for some pictures for your viewing pleasure. Special thank you to everyone at Advaith Hyundai Outer Ring Road, Bangalore. They really moved mountains and went the extra mile to make this purchase happen. My family has been loyal to them for 8 years, and I cannot recommend them enough.

571, ButterChicken , 16:00 ,Newbie," Quote: Is it recommended to put the car in P mode when stopped at signal and if Yes, why? Will that improve mileage? From my understanding, `P` essentially locks the transmission and avoids rolling away, and accidental gear changes - useful only when you're getting out of the vehicle. When stopping at signals, N should suffice. You can apply the handbrake as well, if on a slope. There shouldn't be any difference in mileage between N and P, however, you'll notice a difference in either of these, vs staying in D and depressing the brake pedal ", 10th January 2023,hyundai-grand-i20,Bangalore,7,4

But in the dashboard it is displayed as Front: 38 psi and Rear : 36psi. At first I thought the tpms sensor might need some time to refresh so I ignored it. Although next day too it was showing the same reading so I got the tyre pressure checked again at local puncture shop. But there the reading was matching with what I got at petrol pump(Front : 34psi, Rear: 32psi). For some reason the tpms is displaying extra(+4 psi) tyre pressure.

Can we reset the tpms in any way? Welcome to the Temperamental world of Hyundais TPMS. I am assuming your car is fairly new. If yes, in a few months you will get used to weird readings from the TPMS sensors. After having used an i20 since launch in Oct 2020, these are my observations. Hope they will be useful to you: 1. On most occasions the tyre pressure gauge from pumps/tyre shops/your own device will not agree with the TPMS. There will always be a variation. In my 2 plus years of car ownership Ive never had a time when the readings have been the same. Always had a pressure difference of a psi or two, at least. 2. On most occasions, two different pressure gauges will agree with each other but not with the TPMS. 3. The TPMS pressure displayed fluctuates with changing temperature. I can understand air expands/contracts etc but I didnt think that 30psi displayed early morning can become 35/37psi at 2pm in the afternoon. If so much variation happens then its an eye-opener for me. 4. The above temperature related change also means that sometimes in cold conditions your TPMS warning lamp will light up because of a perceived pressure drop. In such cases you will have to reset the sensor by cranking up the pressure in that tyre and then reducing it back again. 5. In order to mitigate the problem in Point 4, always fill air when the ambient temperature is not at its peak i.e. early morning or late evening. If your tires are cold but its afternoon then its not a good time to fill air. 6. Forget about the TPMS readings. Fill air from a trusted tyre shop/pump. Have your own pressure gauge which you know is accurate, and use the TPMS just as a low pressure warning in case of a puncture. I dont know if the sensors can be calibrated. Maybe they can, if yes it would be great if someone could give a bit more information about it.", 22nd January 2023,hyundai-grand-i20,MH02/MH12,128,466

Model: i20 Turbo DCT- Asta (O)- November 2020. 1. The best figure till date: This is the best I've got but this was after starting the drive from Lonavala City and coming down the ghat till the food mall. Obviously since it was a downhill drive it was with a light foot and for a very short while. However, it must also be noted that this was after the car caught in bumper-bumper traffic for the first fifteen minutes. That explains the 42 minutes taken. 2. Mahabaleshwar to Mumbai drive: The most representative highway figure. I regularly get similar figures on all my highway drives. 3. Typical Pune to Mumbai Drive: A typical expressway drive figure. Pune to Mumbai being mostly downhill, the Fuel Efficiency is around this figure. For Mumbai to Pune it drops to around 16.5 kpl. And finally, the worst fuel efficiency figure delivered by my car till date. This happened on a day I got caught up in the most miserable traffic I've ever encountered in Mumbai.

616, pixeleefied , 18:14 ,Newbie,"I wanted to post about the negative experience I had, both from Hyundai and the dealer. I purchased an All new i20 on May 2022 from Popular Hyundai in Trivandrum. There were many negative experiences from both the dealership and Hyundai itself, right from the first day(Lack of communication regarding delivery timelines, and not providing the agreed discount for the ceramic coating to name a few). I decided not to fuss about these things and let go of these issues, even though some of them have been costly. Last month, the USB port in the center console got damaged as I removed the cable. This is the only port that supports Android Auto. Since the second service was only 2 weeks away, I decided to have it checked then. Gave my vehicle for service on the 25th of April and got it back the same day. SA informed me they have taken pics of the damage(from inside) and sent them to Mobis and that I will receive the response to the claim the next day. I called the SA multiple times, over the next few days. He was saying Mobis rejected my warranty claim as customer damage and I would have to pay the full amount to get it replaced. I asked for the details of the claim in writing as well as the cost of the part, which I didn't receive. Finally, I lost my patience and raised a complaint on the Hyundai website. Got a callback from the customer manager at Popular the next day. He said that he will share the details in writing as an email and the part cost as well. He also mentioned that they would have provided a goodwill discount if I had directly contacted him instead of raising a complaint. This is the mail that I received. He called again the next day and said they would provide a goodwill discount of Rs 2000, which I rejected and said I am not interested to spend Rs 4500+. I have responded to the dealer's mail saying that I have only used my phone's official USB cable, provided by Google. I use the same cable for connecting my phone to my 2 laptops and the charging bricks and I have never had any issues on those devices. I only use the car for long drives and hence the number of times I plug and unplug the cable is also less. I am also not able to comprehend how they think I damaged port pins from the inside. In the meantime, I received an email from Hyundai stating that their customer general manager is looking into this issue and they would get in touch with me. More than 10 days have passed and I still haven't received any call from Hyundai for this.

Also does Sportz DCT come with Automatic Climate Control? Considering the 2-lakh price premium on-road of the Asta(O) DCT over the Sportz DCT in Bangalore, the Sportz DCT is definitely VFM, However, the additional 2 lakh gives you Alloy Wheels, 6 Airbags against 2 in the Sportz, ESP, Hill Hold and Traction Control, Keyless entry. Auto dimming IRVMs, Push button Start, Telematics functionality, Leather wrapped Steering and gear knob, a rear armrest, one touch up windows on the driver side, a rear wiper, chrome exterior door handles, a sunroof, LED Projector headlights, Ambient lighting, puddle lamps, 10.25-inch touchscreen, an air purifier and wireless charging. So, the feature additions are definitely worth it for a more better user experience and hence justified. So, if I am able to afford the Asta(O), I would definitely go for it. As regards, to Automatic Climate Control, no, the Sportz variant no longer comes with it. https://www.team-bhp.com/news/hyunda...%20manual%20AC.", 15th June 2023,hyundai-grand-i20,Muscat,712,"2,212"

Joe N8 DCT comes with factory fitted LED headlight in projector set-up so you don't need to upgrade. Also it has ambient light so adding ambient lighting is feel good factor but not absolute need. I install Aozoom make 130w (65w+65w) led bulb in headlight and it is not the same as the ones which comes from factory. Sorry I don't have factory specification for N8 or Asta. You can add ambient light though as 6 pc ambient light set would be installed on dashboard and 4 doors and will look stunning. The brand is Cardi K4 Ambient lighting.

Asta(O) iVT comes with hill assist control. Hill Assist Control works by holding the car for 2 second on an incline when you remove your foot from brake pedal. Yes it will arrest backward motion completely but only for 2 seconds after which its like any other car. However please consider that for an automatic car this is more of a luxury and not a necessity as you have one less pedal (no clutch) to deal with in tandem to gain forward momentum, immediately after you move your foot from brake.

These are quite known(quietened in India, not documented well in India despite many troubled owners) issues pertinent to all Hyundai and Kia cars since long and are unresolved even in recent launches too. 1. 7 Most Common Problems On The Hyundai i20 Quote: The common problems listed below are made over time and with the feedback of our customers. Hence, depending upon the use, the vehicle batch and other external factors could generate these problems. This means, not everyone faces these problems, but the majority of them could. So, before further ado, lets have a look at the 7 common problems with the Hyundai i20. Steering column issues The cars electric power steering has been known to malfunction, resulting in extremely heavy steering. The motor shuts off automatically to prevent overheating and burnout, which is what causes this. It is a supposedly safe function, and as the car ages, the problem should become better. In addition, the next problem particularly occurs when youre driving on bumpy roads. This is when the steering column makes an inordinate amount of noise. These two are separate problems that occur over some years of use. 2. Hyundai Power Steering Case Study Quote: The majority of undercar complaints will usually be noise related and range from a knocking noise on rough roads, a scraping noise when braking or a clicking noise while turning. Some complaints will include vibrations in the steering wheel and from under the seat. 3. Recall Hyundai Cars In India For Electronic Power Steering Failure Issue 4.

662, SixPistons , 01:14 ,BHPian,"You could check out a miniSUV if ground clearance is a priority. Say, something with 200 mm or higher GC. I think Nexon qualifies on that. Its not too big, going to 4m+ length. Not too small, has enough space. Even Brezza/XUV300(and possibly Venue) are good contenders, if you were to consider C-SUV territory. Also check out the Exter. I haven’t faced any GC issues with mine as such. However, 170 isn’t too bad and is good enough for most city usage. As Revvaton mentioned, take a TD on your preferred route to confirm these doubts. Either way, plenty of options now in the higher GC hatchback territory now ", 30th October 2023,hyundai-grand-i20,New,148,437

We've never faced a ground clearance issue with our i20 N8 so far. However, it also depends on which roads you take it to and how careful you are while driving on such roads. A Fortuner or Thar can also scrap underbody if not driven properly. Of course i20 cannot do a full blown off roading. But mild ""soft"" roading with careful driving should not be a problem. We've driven our i20 on rough roads, over unreasonably sized speed breakers and did few soft roading. So far, underbody has not scraped on them.

664, sameer sultan , 14:16 ,BHPian,"Hi I have booked the i20 Sportz iVT 1.2 Kappa VTVT Starry Night last evening. Delivery is around after 2 weeks. I negotiated a discount of Rs 35000/- on the ex showroom price of Rs 937900/- and also the insurance I will be doing myself which results in a saving of another Rs 35000/-. There was an increase of 3% on the road tax from yesterday in Tamil Nadu so the tax went up by Rs 27000/-. The saving on the insurance kind of offsets this. I had considered Grand i10 Nios Sportz AMT Tata Tiago Ev and the Maruti Suzuki Baleno Delta AMT along with the i20. There was a difference of 1.7 Lacs between the i10 and i20 and the Baleno similar variant was around Rs 50000 lesser than i20. Both Baleno and i10 have the AMT gear box while the i20 has the CVT this was the main factor for me to opt for the i20. The Tata Tiago EV MR XT was costing around Rs 50000/- less than the i20 on road price but that was a very basic version without so many comfort features. The higher versions of the Tiago EV were costing more than the on road i20 price even after the Rs 40000 discount which Tata had announce today.My running is also not that much as it’s going to be a second car. So getting a basic version EV was not making sense. Plus the interiors of the Tiago are very basic compared to the i10/i20/Baleno. I have a few queries. 1) When the dealer offers a discount on the ex showroom price then he will invoice the amount after discount to the customer, hence the road tax should be on this amount only but they say they will take the road tax on the original ex showroom price. is it the right way of calculating ? 2) Has anyone taken insurance from ACKO? They are quoting Rs 21000/- including GST on the IDV of Rs 9.37 for comprehensive bumper to bumper insurance for 1 year + 3 years third party. Whereas the dealer had quoted Rs 54416/-. 3) What is the mileage can I expect in city traffic?", 10th November 2023,hyundai-grand-i20,Chennai,435,788
665, TheCarCrack , 21:06 ,Newbie,"Hello fellow TBHPians, I'm posting this on behalf of my brother who recently purchased an i20 and this is his account of his delivery experience, initial review and the niggles experienced since then. Here we go: Owning a new car is an exciting experience, and my Hyundai i20 in Fiery Red, Sportz variant with IVT transmission, undoubtedly brings a sense of pride. However, like any new purchase, the journey comes with its sets of challenges and discoveries. Delivery and Initial Impressions: My Hyundai i20 was registered on October 20th, 2023, and delivered on October 24th from Kun Hyundai in Chennai. The colour choice, Fiery Red, adds a vibrant touch to the Sportz variant, featuring the IVT transmission. Excitement turned to concern as unexpected issues emerged, leading to a series of adjustments and upgrades. Tyre Disappointment and Upgrade: The car came with CEAT tyres and disappointingly, the CEAT tires (195/55 R16) didn't meet my expectations, leading me to opt for an upgrade to Continental tyres with a size of 205/55 R16 for improved performance and aesthetics. The decision to maintain the same rim size while enhancing performance is a common modification among car enthusiasts. Interior Modifications: The Sportz variant revealed its limitations – no leather door pads, a non-leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a non-movable center armrest. A notable departure from the Asta and Asta(O) variants left me pondering the true definition of ""premium hatchback."". To address this, I decided to wrap the door pads and the steering wheel, giving my i20 a personalized touch. Further modifications included damping the bonnet, which, unfortunately, led to unintended consequences. I invested in a Blaupunkt 6mm bonnet damping sheet with the expectation of reducing engine noise and enhancing heat absorption. Regrettably, the professionals at the accessories shop failed to secure it adequately. Glitches emerged, with the sheet inadequately sticking, particularly at the edges, and the central portion of the bonnet resisted proper adhesion. Despite employing rollers in an attempt to rectify the issue, the persistent detachment of the sheet left me dissatisfied with the results. Fearing potential complications within the engine bay, I ultimately decided to remove it altogether. Beige upholstery proved susceptible to stains, necessitating the addition of Jackspeed seat covers for both practicality and aesthetics. Audio System Issues: Upon delivery, I encountered issues with door vibrations particularly on the front passenger door while playing music. Despite seeking assistance from Hyundai's customer care and service technicians, the provided solutions were unsatisfactory. Frustrated, I took matters into my own hands, choosing to dampen the doors independently, which I will be doing soon. Unsatisfactory Build Quality: Beyond the initial audio issues, I faced additional challenges. The removal of rear headrests and fog lamps, the absence of damping in the doors during manufacturing, and the unexpected vibrations in the steering wheel after turning on the air conditioner have contributed to a series of disappointments. A persistent issue with the steering wheel vibrating, particularly when the air conditioner was engaged, became a source of frustration. Service Center Experience: I visited the Hyundai service center due to vibrations in my new car's steering wheel and general vibrations when the air conditioner was switched on. Initially, a technician claimed it was normal for a new car, but I insisted on a senior technician. After a road test, the senior technician acknowledged the issue and was told that the car needs to be kept at the service centre for a deeper inspection, suggesting a possible manufacturing defect. I was promised a call the next day at 12pm but didn't receive one until two hours later, at around 2:30pm informing me that the problem was rectified by adjusting the torque. Despite confusion about this solution, I returned to the service center for a road test. The vibrations persisted, and when questioning the technicians about the problem, they couldn't provide a satisfying explanation, mentioning the removal and refixing of some components in the engine bay. Despite the service, the vibrations continued, leaving me dissatisfied and questioning the competence of Hyundai's experienced mechanics. The issue has significantly impacted my driving experience. Conclusion: Owning a Hyundai i20 Sportz IVT has been a rollercoaster of experiences, ranging from initial excitement to frustration with various glitches. My determination to address these issues independently showcases my commitment to ensuring a satisfactory driving experience. As my journey with the i20 continues, one can only hope that Hyundai addresses these concerns, providing solutions that match the premium expectations associated with the brand. My experience, though challenging, offers valuable insights for potential Hyundai buyers and highlights the importance of thorough research and consideration when choosing a new vehicle. If anyone can provide any insights as to what might be causing this vibration to occur, please do let us know. Cheers!", 19th November 2023,hyundai-grand-i20,Bengaluru,1,0

671, sameer sultan , 12:33 ,BHPian,Its been 12 days since I got the i20 Sportz iVT and I thought Id put out some initial impressions. There is a grunt in the engine at idle and also at low RPMs. Its quiet unlike for a petrol motor. On a single tank full I could drive for 280 kms. That was about 8 kms/litre. I hope the mileage increases in the future. There is major discrepancy in what the Distance to Empty shows and the actual running of the car. It is not at all accurate. When I filled up the tank it was showing 657kms range but as mentioned above I did only about 280kms and the DTE was showing another 25kms. No idea on what basis the DTE is calculated by the cars computer. For every 500meters of distance at least 3 kms comes down in the DTE meter. What is the point to show an inflated range only to not actually give the actual values. The DTE should be linked to the fuel efficiency calculator on board so that it can give out real world figures. Or wait is the fuel economy system is not working properly too?? Also there is discrepancy in the TPMS values. I have checked the Tyre air pressure twice since taking the delivery of the vehicle and have kept it at 28psi for all tires. But the on board TPMS shows 32psi for front tires and 31psi for rear tires. What is the point of having so many onboard systems if they do not work properly?, 11th December 2023,hyundai-grand-i20,Chennai,435,788

When you get the tank full it will display the maximum range possible. Once we start driving it keeps adjusting according to our driving. In my case once I stop for sometime and then start back it adjusts correctly. I always keep a buffer of 30-40kms but more or less it matches. Coming to the tpms, there will always be 1 psi here or there and it won't be hundred percent accurate. Also the recommended pressure is 33 front and 31 rear, if it is 28 psi then I think it should sound the alert.", 11th December 2023,hyundai-grand-i20,Hyderabad,204,485

681, 007maverick , 11:20 ,BHPian,"Ownership Experience after 6 months – i20 Asta (O) Petrol Manual I took more than couple of years to finalize my new car. My Ritz ZXi petrol MT BS4 2009 was doing a fantastic job and at times made me think if I should sweat the asset for another couple of years. The Tall boy was a rare gem from Maruti’s stable and was like a first “mini SUV” on Indian roads – just 40 Kg lighter than Venue on Kerb weight, equipped with 60:40 seats, 43 Litres of fuel tank, two front Air bags, ABS/EBD, Height adjustable seats, all seat adjustable headrests etc. It had a thicker body panels compared to all Maruti Suzuki cars. It was co-designed by Suzuki with Opel for European Market. The Car had high aerodynamic drag, bit of higher tyre noise and body roll. It was a fun to carry out detail study of various cars as part of desktop and primary research. The research was followed with Test drives of i10, Aura, Venue, Amaze, Magnite, Kiger, Nexon, MG Astor, XUV, Duster, Free style, Ecosport. I was completely agnostic on type of fuel (except CNG) and kept the budget bit flexible based on the value that car would offer. I had almost finalized top end Ecosport Diesel MT, but had to drop the idea due to Ford’s announcement of exiting India market. I liked Aster but sensed that to be a likely fuel guzzler. New i20 was never in my consideration set. I was of the view that the Car doesn’t merit a price premium that it charges to customers. However, visiting Hyundai dealership casually on one of the Sunday evenings with family has changed that perception. It was a base model that was kept at the Dealership. But it amazed me with impeccable fit-n-finish, well laid out black interiors, ergonomics - perfect size of steering wheel, smooth pedal feel, gear shifter exactly positioned where I wanted it to be, big interior space and ample leg room for rear passengers. While everyone at the dealership was super busy to handle SUVs, I asked the dealer to give me i20 for a test drive on the next week end. It was i20 top end for the test drive. The car has almost everything that one would like to have in the new car – superb NVH, tilt & telescopic steering to adjust for seating preference, good road visibility, alloy wheels, ABS/EBD/Vehicle stability Management, adjustable head rests for all passengers, TPMS, fog lamps, cruise control, rear wiper, 6 air bags, auto folding mirrors, top quality infotainment system, rear sensors and camera equipped with dynamic grid lines. Sunroof was never my requirement, but i20 has it. So, it was like a bonus. The only sensible missing feature was 60:40 rear seat. Boot appeared to be decent to carry 2 medium size suitcases and miscellaneous stuff. Couldn’t test high speed cornering, but on road stability of the vehicle and feel of the steering was giving adequate confidence that the car will be like a leach on demanding road conditions. Straight line positioning was excellent with steering coming at the center nicely. The looks are subjective, and hence will not detail on that. It was a pleasant surprise when I was going through the specs that i20 has higher wheelbase as compared to some of the premium Compact + sedans in the market. The Booking process was smooth with a downpayment of Rs. 5000 (fully refundable in case of cancellation). Selecting the variant was relatively easier. Always my preference was to opt for Top end as it gives some of the best of goodies from the feature basket in factory fitted avatar. Opted for Asta (0) Petrol -RDE compliant. I am not a fan of 3 Cylinder turbochargers. 3 Cylinders by design are not naturally balanced, and plus Turbo on top adds to noise, engg complexity and a possible higher maintenance over a life cycle. I chose Silver. In my view this color has a good balance between looks, vehicle visibility, lesser heating compared to darker siblings, ease of maintenance. I opted for BH registration, 7 year warranty, Hyundai SOT (Shield of Trust) and Super SOT. There was a waiting period of 10 -12 weeks. Always wanted to go for manual gearbox as it keeps you engaged with the vehicle, gives you full command & control while driving, gives you additional lever for decelerating the car in emergency situation, gives you freedom to experiment with Vehicle speed-Engine RPM range to play with efficiency OR performance by yourself rather than some AI doing it for you in the name of Driving mode selection. The dealership offered Cash discount for taking Company insurance (straight difference between Dealership quote and market quote + additional 5 K). I think it always better to take insurance from dealership even if it comes with some premium as they become more accountable to your car. Received a call from dealer after 1 ½ months that they have got confirmation that the Car is ready with PDI at the factory. It was a good feeling to get your “make- to-order” vehicle. PDI process at the dealer’s stockyard was smooth. I personally did the PDI for about an hour (top bottom – back to rear) with a checklist and there were absolutely no surprises. Great Job Hyundai!! The vehicle was ready for delivery on the chosen date- 27th April 2023 I have opted for minimum accessories such as floor lamination, rubber mats & mud flap kit. The logic was to get these accessories fitted from the dealership where some major parts are required to be removed for fitting the accessory. For floor lamination, they take out the seats and put them back. These days there are so many sensors and features in the vehicle, and there is chance that Car accessories shops may not even aware and can potentially even damage the things. I have avoided putting the seat covers, as it can cause obstruction to side air bags operation. Safety first !! Specifically chose morning time (10-11.30) for car delivery since in a day light you can recheck the vehicle properly, and most of dealership people are fresh to explain all features, carry out documentation etc. Carried a sweet box for dealership people. The dealership had made a wonderful arrangement for car delivery and me & my family will cherish those moments. After driving the vehicle for around 6000 Km, the vehicle continue to deliver what was expected from it– solid build, excellent ride quality, roll almost to nil, decent handling characteristics, good seats which holds you well with excellent under thigh support and optimum softness for a long drive comfort. The first service experience at Hyundai dealership was good with no negative surprises. I got the engine oil change done while the owner manual recommendation was 10000 Km /12 month. As part of SOT package, got complimentary underbody coating from 3 M at the service center. I had got underbody coating from 3 M on Ritz, and know how useful it is. It prevent underbody rust and to some extent adds to improving NVH. In the last 6 months, got car washed only during free service. Happily doing self-cleaning with Jopasu. It just takes 10 minutes of time alternate day, and gives you a satisfaction of saving few buckets of fresh water. Purchased a pair of good quality microfiber cloth and again doing a self cleaning with a 1 bottle of water and interior dry dusting once a month. I absolutely don’t see a need for paint coating, wax polishing from car detailers. The Company fitted 195/55 R16 Secura Drive are great tyres both in form factor and function. There is absolutely no need to get those replaced with a fancy brand or a higher/lower size. Hyundai is able to achieve a sweet spot as far as Powertrain is concerned on new i20. While 1.2 Kappa is not as peppy as Suzuki’ K series, its smooth, refined and gives a decent performance on i20 if one considers it for a well matured Car under safe driving practices on Indian road conditions. I am getting a mileage of 14-16 within City based on traffic conditions and 18-20 on a highway without cruise control, depending on whether I choose Efficiency OR performance. Cruise control in 5th gear at 70 Kmph delivers best of the mileage. The figure on dashboard touches 37 mph on a 30 Km patch which has a fair bit of decent between Pune & Mumbai. The engine becomes lively after 1600 rpm and is a fun to cruise on the High way. The powertrain is at ease to haul the car at 1200 rpm in 5th gear delivering a speed of 45 kmph. In city traffic condition, the car crawls in 3rd gear at engine speed as low as 800 rpm. If there is a very steep gradient conditions, shifting to 1st gear becomes inevitable for a very brief duration and quite understandable for a 1.2 L naturally aspirated motor. Gear shifter is super smooth WO any notchy feeling. One has to be little careful initially for switching to Reverse till one gets accustomed with its exact position. Suspension found to be little stiff, but yeah it keeps you grounded. 170 mm ground clearance appears to be adequate. So-far no scratching the bottom even after one full monsoon experience. I just felt that Hyundai should have offered (1) Height adjustable seat for co-driver (2) Walk-away automatic door locking (a complete miss from Hyundai !!) (3) Start-stop (I think they have given this on facelift) (4) option to switch-off ambient lighting and Audio system which automatically pops up (quite irritating in case you stop in heavy traffic and you have to kick in ignition. Hyundai could have also used the space in dashboard little more wisely to provide some nice additional spaces for storage. Ritz was way ahead on this front. User interface of Blue link app is dated and quite boring. Surprising it doesn’t show the trip mileage. I will be glad to have comments from fellow TEAM BHP members on these observations. Happy to see relatively lesser numbers of new i20 on roads –it adds to the car’s exclusivity and, aspirational appeal. I adore the car whenever I see its reflection on the go, with lovely and unique DRLs and LED head lamp cluster set-up. Overall, a very satisfactory experience. Big thumbs up to MHI for such a nice car !!! Few learnings that I would like to share herewith for new buyers : Do your homework to understand car variants, features, specs and prices. Many times dealership guys don’t know/ will not tell you the basic things about the car which might be the most important thing for you. Invest your time for going to dealership for test drives, PDI, Servicing. Beyond a product, you will understand the Brand better at the dealerships. Test drive cars of adjacent segments from your shortlisted one. This helps to take the well-informed decision. Watch long term reviews for the car that you have shortlisted. However, experiencing the car first hand by taking test drives is absolutely must. Experts’ requirements are not necessarily align with yours. Take a test drive by switching off infotainment system, mobile phone, ask the dealer guy to sit at the rear seat. Engage fully with the Vehicle. Never just rely on few car enthusiasts’ opinion on car shows. Most of the time they are paid reviews. You note down your own expectations and see how the car performs on those parameters when you handler it before finalizing the vehicle and variant. Choose dealership wisely. Discount and early delivery should not be the first criteria. It should ideally be dealer’s reputation in the market, people capabilities, service support. All these come handy during product life cycle. SUV looks give car manufacturers easy premium of 3 to 4 lakh rupees. Many mini/ micros/compact SUVs are built on a base platform of a car and at times with variants with compromising features. Its difficult to digest the fact that some of SUV variants costing 15 lakhs don’t offer basic things like rear wiper. So don’t get into “SUV trap” if that kind of vehicle is not your requirement. SUVs provide high Ground Clearance at the cost of ride & handling, higher aerodynamic drag. Don’t compromise while buying real value stuff add value to car such as extended warranty, insurance inclusions, AMC package. Its worth spending money on these rather on gizmos which don’t add much value to the car on long run and almost nothing in resale value. Automatic climate control, Fog lamps, Rear Wiper, Alloy Wheels (looks apart, they dissipate the heat faster and improve braking and liner life) are essential features. Prioritize these over gizmos. Last but not the least… don’t rush through to purchase unless there is some emergency of buying the vehicle. If you miss one deal, there are multiple others which will open up. Check Air pressure at regular intervals, try to fill nitrogen, get down and have a conversation with petrol bunk attendant while he/she is dispensing the fuel.

Both the variants - Sportz and Asta have the same tyre size i.e. 195/55 R16. So technically it should be feasible to upgrade. Note that Metallic wheel rims will fetch you nothing except Scrap value. So there will not be any replacement value. You may have to budget around 35 - 40 K for 4 tyres depending on the brand that you choose. Suggest check with Hyundai dealer and couple of other reputed tyre dealers before making a decision.

Eventhough I knew about Hyundai's headlight performance it didn't bother me much because I rarely travelled at night but lately I had instances where I had to and it was really difficult to manage. The vehicle manufacturer has to mandatorily carry out the headlight testing as part of vehicle certification. Hence there has to be a minimum throw, area coverage & illumination by regulation. Suggest first check with the dealer mechanic if Hi/ Lo Beam needs some adjustment, before going for a replacement. Also check if headlight lenses are clear (many times it looses transparency due to washing by hard water). Irrespective whether one drives in the night or not, good headlight is absolutely must for the car. Quote: Originally Posted by bhavesh995 Hi All.

I didn't face any issue in the City conditions (during monsoon Pune roads become ""Testing tracks"") and occasional long drives. However one has to be bit careful on horrendous Speed brakers - you have to be alert & slow down the vehicle. Vehicles with high GC will overcome such things, but underneath you are damaging the suspension WO realising it. In one of the recent trips, my car was fully loaded with 1+4 adults & luggage, and I drove the vehicle on countryside. Didn't face any issue.

If yes, please suggest a dealer in Noida or Delhi NCR that you know has Michelin tyres in stock or can arrange them. It's a serious safety issue. Hope your car has TPMS and you regularly check the tyre pressur and keep the values closer to the recommended ones For deciding the tyre Brand...keep a note of your exact requirements...are you looking for performance, low tyre noise, road grip, mileage.

All in all good experience so far but a couple of times the car has gone a little crazy on me so wondering if I should have it checked now or wait for the first service in Feb. 1. The car engine refused to start when I turned in the ignition key. The initial display lights came on for a second or so but nothing after that. This was while going back from work and it had driven without issues to office in the morning. I waited 5 minutes tried again and it turned on this time and I got home without issues. 2. A few days later the car was stopped at a turn (in D mode). When traffic cleared I lifted my foot off the brake expecting the car to creep but it didn't move, at all. Light pressing of the accelerator didn't do anything either. By now the folks behind me had started screaming so I hit the accelerator full on and the car moved and then I was able to control the speed and drive away. I had the Hyundai service center install the DHC 360 Camera, there have been no other customization. I have heard of the earlier i20's defective fuel pump issues causing the car to stall, could the facelift version have inherited it? I have a feeling even if I take it to the service center they might not find anything as it's been so sporadic.

688, s_mp , 10:08 ,Newbie," Quote: Originally Posted by goandude Could you share the price of this camera, the integration with your OEM head unit and your view of this modification. Thanks It cost me 37K. I had it installed by the Hyundai service folks. I wouldn't really call it a must-have. I felt the need for it in the first week as I had switched from a much smaller car but now with time I have gotten used to the car's size and barely use the front/side views. The stock reverse view cameras would have been sufficient. That said I drive mostly on the main road so I am guessing the additional views will be useful in cramped roads while turning/over taking. Yet to test these out. It integrated well with the infotainment unit. One niggle is, if you have the navigation on, then using the left/right indicator will bring up the camera views and overwrite the maps. I am guessing there must be a way to set the maps as a favorite so one press of the favorite button brings it back on but I wish the map came back on by default once the indicator is turned off. So until figure that out, I have to use my phone for navigation The latest version of DHC 360 camera apparently overrides the stock reverse view camera (there is no way to retain the stock ones for reverse view alone) and I feel the Hyundai ones were superior. DHC does come with guidance lines but I do miss the default one's refined view.", 18th January 2024,hyundai-grand-i20,Bangalore,17,9

The overall build of the car is a notch down from the previous generation car, I can say this with confidence having owned the previous generation i20. 2. Further to point no. 1, noticeable rattles started within the first 20,000 kms, particularly from the dashboard, the service Center has not been able to rectify this issue. 3. The ride quality is certainly stiffer than the outgoing generation. 4. The front left ABS sensor malfunctioned and is replaced under warranty. 5.

If the aftermarket rear camera is powered by the stock rear camera wire via some adapter, it is not enough power generated. This causes a lag in the gear selection and explains why you car didnt move when you put it in D. The aftermarket camera should be receive the signal from stock reverse camera wire via the adaptor along with a wire tap the reverse light for power.
