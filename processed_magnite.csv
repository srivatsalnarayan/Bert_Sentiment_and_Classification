0, Aditya , 13:30 ,Team-BHP Support,"Nissan Magnite Review Nissan Magnite Pros • The Magnite looks really good…that handsome face is a head-turner • Sheer value-for-money pricing. Turbo-petrol with a proper AT under 10 lakhs! • Peppy performance from the Magnite’s 1.0L turbo-petrol engine • Smooth well-tuned CVT in a sea of jerky AMTs. Has Sport and L modes too • Healthy legroom for rear passengers. Space packaging is brilliant • Impressive kit (cruise control, LED headlamps, rear air-con vents, 360-degree camera, wireless charger, wireless Android Auto & Apple CarPlay) • 205 mm of ground clearance is more than enough for any kind of bad roads • Safety kit includes ESP, TPMS, ABS, EBD & hill start assist • Base variant also gets reasonable kit, including a rear wiper. It’s not poverty-spec Nissan Magnite Cons • Stiff & basic ride quality. You feel each and everything on the road • The Magnite is built to a cost and it does show, especially in the budget-grade cabin • Lower variants’ 1.0L naturally-aspirated petrol is a boring, unimpressive engine • Clunky, firm MT gearshift & a clutch pedal that has more weight than it should • No diesel option available on the Nissan Magnite • Cabin is narrower than some competitors. Narrow width makes it best for 4 adults • Missing features such as an auto dimming IRVM, full-size spare tyre… • Doesn't have the finesse or quality of premium crossovers like the XUV300, Sonet etc. • Nissan's tiny dealership network & lousy after-sales quality Introduction The Nissan Magnite Concept sub-4 meter crossover was unveiled in July this year. Now, the company has given us a preview of the car in Mumbai. The vehicle is expected to be launched in India by the end of 2020. GTO had said that the only thing that might save Nissan India is a good crossover / SUV and this car might just be it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-V...ature=youtu.be Exterior Good-looking aggressive front. Big grille is very ""Datsun"". Car is built on the CMF-A+ platform that also underpins the Triber: This Flare Garnet Red shade is the signature colour of the Magnite. While fit & finish and paint quality are satisfactory, the build is not as solid as some other sub-4m crossovers. The doors, bonnet and tailgate are all light and body panels do flex when pushed with a thumb. I wouldn’t consider the Magnite as a direct competitor to the likes of the XUV300 or Sonet because their quality level is distinctly higher. Those feel “premium”, the Magnite doesn’t. The Magnite is more “Datsun” than Nissan: Front end is dominated by a huge radiator grille which looks heavily influenced by the design used by Datsun. Notice how the front bumper panel stretches around the grille, and all the way up to the bonnet: Rear end features split LED tail-lamps and bold ""MAGNITE"" lettering on the tailgate. Exhaust pipe is nicely concealed under the bumper. We like the styling: Bulky sides feature flared, square wheel arches, lots of cuts and creases and plastic cladding to give the Magnite a rugged appearance. The car provided had a white roof. Turning radius is 5 meters: LED bi-projector headlamps with LED turn-indicators at the top: The grille's detailing is different from Datsun's. Prominent chrome on the sides, with Nissan's new badge in the center. A 360-degree camera system has been provided! Gosh, the kind of features coming to the sub-10 lakh segment these days . Front camera is located just below the badge: L-shaped LED DRLs and LED foglamps. A silver faux skid plate has been provided as well: A look at the DRLs and foglamps in action: Ground clearance of 205 mm is very close to the best-in-class 209 mm of the Tata Nexon: Bonnet features a wide and largely flat central dome, while the prominent creases on the side give it some muscle. Panel gaps? Overall, there are a couple that are wide, and a few that are inconsistent: Nicely-done Nissan Magnite badges on the fender panels: ORVMs are finished in the same colour as the roof. They get integrated LED blinkers. Both side cameras (for the 360 degree display) are placed under the ORVMs: Puddle lamp under the ORVM displays a welcome message, with detailing similar to the one on the radiator grille: Chrome door handles. Both units gets a request sensor. Only RHS unit gets a keyhole: Dual-tone, diamond-cut 16"" alloy wheels look funky. Shod with 195/60 section MRF Wanderer tyres: Small mud-flaps located ahead of the front tyres: Rear wheel arch gets a splash guard: Good deal of plastic cladding in the front wheel well... ...but none in the rear wheel well: Plastic cladding on the doors gets a silver strip: Window line rises towards the rear. Chrome strip provided at the base of the windows. Notice how small the rear quarter glass is: C-Pillar is very thick. Notice the very-prominent haunch below: Gets silver roof rails. Roof is ribbed for structural rigidity. A long removable antenna sits at the rear: Roof rails are functional and have provisions to attach a rack. Load bearing capacity = 50 kg: Rear spoiler is shaped such that it integrates well with the roof's curvatures: Curvy tailgate features prominent creases and a slim plastic panel on which the Nissan badge is pasted. ""Turbo"" and ""CVT"" badges in the bottom corners: A look at the tail-lamps in action: Dual-tone rear bumper houses 4 parking sensors and a pair of slim reflectors. Skid plate is finished in black: 40L fuel tank is smaller than most competitors: ", 21st October 2020,Mumbai,17476,75369,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
1, Aditya , 13:30 ,Team-BHP Support,"Interior Just like other crossovers, ingress & egress are easier than in hatchbacks or low sedans. Interiors are all-black, with silver & piano black inserts. Many parts are lifted from the recently launched Renault Triber. We like the overall design. As expected for this segment, the plastics on the dashboard are all hard. Part quality is rather budget-grade, there is no comparison to the Venue or XUV300. Albeit, the Magnite is also priced lower: Leather-wrapped 3-spoke steering wheel looks premium. Buttons for operating the entertainment and telephone are located on the left spoke, while those for the MID and cruise control are placed on the right spoke. Steering has rake adjustment only: Illuminated black engine start button with a thick chrome ring is weirdly placed on the center fascia: 7"" TFT instrument cluster is fully digital with temperature and fuel gauges on the sides, a speedometer in the middle, a revv-counter around it, two trip meters and an odometer. You can switch views to see average and instant fuel consumption, FE history, and a tyre pressure monitoring system. MID displays the specific door that is open. While it covers the tailgate, the bonnet is left out: To the right of the steering wheel are the switches for the headlamp leveller, cruise control and traction control off: Wiper and light stalks look low budget, but are not flimsy. No automatic headlight or wiper functions in the Magnite: Keyfob design is identical to that of the Sunny which was launched 9 years ago. No boot release function provided though: All-black doorpad has hard plastics. Armrest area gets softer, fabric insert with white stitching. Door handle is finished in silver and so is the side of the power window console. Don't miss the outdated pull / push type door locks at the top. Door pockets can hold a 1L bottle and other knick knacks. Front speaker is housed in the doorpad as well: ORVMs get electric-folding: Smart-looking black fabric seats with leatherette on the sides and white stitching, adjustable headrests and side bolstering. Nissan has beefed up the lower back support & we found it to be satisfactory, even though the seats are quite slim. Driver's seat is adjustable for height, but not the seatbelts. A driver armrest has been provided - tall drivers can use it, although short drivers will find it useless: Footwell gets a dead pedal, but its brick-like design looks sad. What's more, its placed too much in the front and is ergonomically poor, at least for 5'10"" drivers like me. In the MT variant, the A-B-C pedals fill up the wheel well and there is no dead pedal / space to rest your left foot on long drives: Outdated pull-type round knob to open the bonnet is placed even lower, and into the dashboard: OBD port is located under the dashboard on the passenger side: Day / Night manually-adjustable IRVM looks cheap & boring. We found it to be two sizes too narrow - doesn't cover the rear windscreen entirely: Center fascia has a prominent tilt towards the driver. Hexagonal air-con vents get thick silver borders: 8"" touchscreen head-unit with 6 speakers and wireless Android Auto + Apple CarPlay. While the touchscreen is fair to use, it can get laggy. Also, it kept dropping the Android Auto connection to our phone. Sound quality is typical OEM type, nothing to write home about: ""Driving Eco"" display gives you a score based on how efficient your driving style is, and also individual star ratings for acceleration, gear shifting and anticipation (braking). The trip report gives the total distance, time taken, average fuel consumption, average speed and uniquely, the distance traveled without any fuel consumption (we're guessing this is coasting). Around View Monitor (AVM) or simply put, the 360 degree camera system makes parking easy: Display quality is average during the day & poor at night. Guidelines have been provided, but they are fixed and not adaptive: One can zoom in to park closer to the kerb. Colour, brightness and contrast of the display can be adjusted: Circular knobs with a knurled finish + chrome ring for the climate control system. All climate control settings are displayed on screens located on the same knobs. The 4 aircraft-style switches for the defogger, auto mode, air-con and fresh air mode aren't illuminated and get difficult to find in the dark. They look cool though Below the climate control panel is a wireless smartphone charger. This is an optional feature and a part of the ""Tech Pack"" in which you can also pick an air purifier, puddle lamps and ambient mood lighting: USB port, 12V power outlet & another storage area are provided at the base of the center fascia: 2 really large cupholders are located next to the handbrake: A closer look at the detailing on the dashboard. The plastic quality is basic, yet we like the effect this detailing brings. Dual airbags are standard in the Magnite. With some sub-4 m crossovers already offering up to 6 airbags, we expected Nissan to provide more than just 2 (especially when its sibling - the Triber - has 4 airbags!): Huge, 10L glovebox has compartments & illumination: Sunvisors are meaty. Both units get vanity mirrors with covers. Driver gets a ticket holder as well: Driver's rearward view is average. Rear headrests are small, but the C-pillars are thick: Recommended tyre pressure of 36 PSI is way too high and partly responsible for the stiff ride quality of the Magnite: Rear doorpads get an identical theme to the front ones. Door pockets are slightly smaller than the ones in front: Rear seat is more suitable for 2 adults and a child, rather than 3 adults. While the seatbase is largely flat, the seatbacks have some contours to hold you in place. Two adjustable headrests as well as ISOFIX child seat anchors on both sides have been provided. A center armrest with cupholders is given. GTO wishes that the seatback was more reclined; he found it a level too upright: With the driver’s seat adjusted to my 5'10"" position, I have about 3 inches of knee room to spare. Push the driver’s seat all the way back and I can still fit. Brilliant space packaging: Center armrest is wide and soft. It comes with two cupholders and a slot to park your smartphone: Surprisingly, two tall occupants can sit one behind the other. Floor hump is not prominent and the center console doesn't eat into the 5th occupant's kneeroom. Front seats are scooped out to liberate more space. Both front seatbacks have usable pockets for storing the oddities: Rear air-con vents & a 12V power outlet: Nissan needs to pay attention to quality control. The cabin lamp in one of our test cars was loose and came off with no effort! Even on the inside, the upper part of the tailgate and the tailgate body frame are painted in the same colour as the roof: 336L boot is fairly sized. Boot comes with illumination and a bag hook on both sides. A parcel tray with a prominent border has been provided as well. Folding the rear seat down gives you much more cargo capacity: Spare wheel is a steel space saver with an 80 km/h speed limit. Tools and warning triangle are crammed into a bag that is left randomly in the spare wheel well: While the hatch gets proper cladding on the inside, the demister connectors are left exposed; plastic caps should have been used to cover them: ", 21st October 2020,Mumbai,17476,75369,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
2, Aditya , 13:33 ,Team-BHP Support,"Driving the 1.0L Turbo-Petrol MT 1.0L turbo-petrol engine puts out 99 BHP & 160 Nm: The Magnite is powered by a 999cc, 3-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine. Called the HRA0, this engine produces 99 BHP and 160 Nm, which is healthy, although there are rivals that offer more power. The car weighs 1,014 kg. This gives it a power-to-weight ratio of 98 BHP / ton and a torque-to-weight ratio of 158 Nm / ton. While the former is not as high as some of the Magnite's rivals, the latter is better than the cars in the segment. There is enough grunt in this engine to keep most drivers happy. On startup, being a 3-cylinder, there is slight body shake and a few vibrations do come into the cabin. Faint vibes are felt on the steering, pedals and the driver's seat. The idle is indeed irregular. On the move, there are some vibrations felt on the gear knob as well. While none of these is particularly annoying & we don't expect owners to complain, refinement is not as impressive as some of the recent 3-cylinder motors we have driven (e.g. Hyundai-Kia's 1.0). The Magnite moves off from a standstill in a clean manner. Despite the turbocharger + small engine size, driveability is acceptable and power delivery is user-friendly. The turbo-petrol has a fair low end and yes, the car clears the 2nd gear speed breaker test; it's certainly not dead off-boost. Some lag is there of course, yet it's well-controlled. That said, you have to be a little patient when pulling from low rpms in 2nd gear. You won’t need to downshift much in the city. The only time you are likely to feel the turbo lag is on an incline or if you need to suddenly close a gap in traffic. The engine starts coming into its stride above 1,750 rpm. Around town, it can cruise at 40 km/h in 3rd gear with the engine spinning at ~ 1,650 rpm without a problem. Above 2,250 rpm, the engine comes into its power band and you can make good progress. The open road is where you'll really enjoy this engine. Floor the throttle in the turbo-petrol and there's a nice pull from the engine with a bit of enjoyable torque steer. The mid-range is strong too with a healthy surge of power. Keep the revvs in the powerband and the Magnite becomes quite a quick highway cruiser. The engine revvs till 6,500 rpm, but not happily as it groans & moans at the redline in a very crude manner. By this point, power has started tapering off and you will have already shifted up. Driveability is good and you won't find the need to downshift often, although there is some lag in the higher gears. So, while passing slow moving vehicles on undivided highways, it is better to downshift, use the turbo's mid-range and fly past them. In 5th gear, the car can cruise at 100 km/h & 120 km/h @ ~2,300 rpm & ~2,800 rpm respectively. The Magnite is equipped with 'hill-start assist'. Stop on an incline, the car will hold itself in place and not roll back giving the driver enough time to get his foot off the brake pedal and onto the accelerator. The 5-speed gearbox offers a poor shifting experience. I found the shift action to be quite clunky and it does require some effort to use. This is not your light Japanese car gearbox at all. In fact, of all the cars we have tested in the last year or two, I cannot think of any which had a poorer shifting quality. As if to match that, the MT's clutch pedal too has weight...more weight than you'd expect in such a small car. In fact, it is quite diesel car-like to use. Our suggestion = pick the super smooth CVT instead. Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH) Coming to NVH levels, the Magnite does well at slow speeds and around town. Upon revving, you can hear that familiar 3-cylinder thrum, yet this noise is not excessive. Even while cruising on the highway, the engine is audible, but not irritatingly so. It's above 5,000 rpm that the motor gets loud. In such a cheap car, I would have expected wind & road noise to be excessive, but no. The cabin is acceptably insulated. Neither wind nor road noise are bothersome at all on the expressway. Insulation sheet under the bonnet: While there is some underbody protection provided, it does not stretch back a long way: Gear shifter gets a glossy black top, silver border and faux leather boot. While the knob looks great, the finish around it could be better. The leather boot feels cheap and outdated: A-B-C pedals are well positioned. No dead pedal provided though & the narrow footwell doesn't leave you space to rest your left foot! Driving the 1.0L Turbo-Petrol CVT The Magnite turbo-petrol also comes with a CVT (continuously variable transmission) Automatic. It's good to see Nissan give a proper automatic gearbox instead of an AMT like some other manufacturers. A CVT has less moving parts than a conventional AT, is lighter and brings a butter-smooth driving experience. However, CVTs also suffer from the rubber-band effect wherein hard throttle input will lead to revs rising with no corresponding increase in speed. While this behaviour is present in the Magnite, Nissan has done well to smoothen the experience & it's not bothersome at all. The Magnite AT gets a Sport mode as well, but not a manual mode or paddle shifters. Like the MT, the turbo-petrol in the CVT produces 99 BHP. However, unlike the MT, the peak torque has been restricted to 152 Nm. To start the car, put your foot on the brake pedal and press the starter button. Take your foot off the brake pedal and the vehicle starts crawling @ ~10 km/h. This means you can drive the car with just the brake pedal in stop & go traffic (no need to press the accelerator). The Magnite CVT provides a seamless experience in the city. As there aren't any actual gearshifts taking place, the drive feels butter-smooth. Forget AMTs, even torque converter & dual-clutch ATs cannot touch a CVT for smoothness. Throttle response is very good and the infamous rubber-band effect is superbly controlled when driven with a light foot. Even when you get aggressive, the engine and transmission respond fairly well compared to some other CVTs. This is easily one of the better CVTs in the market. The light steering, smooth transmission and good all-round visibility make the Magnite an easy car to drive in city traffic. On the open road, the turbocharged engine makes sure that the Magnite CVT offers good performance. The rubber-band effect is present when you drive aggressively, but nowhere as bad as I have seen in some other cars (like the Baleno / Micra CVT). Open-road performance is very satisfactory and owners will be pleased. The strong mid-range (typical of turbo-petrols) is also enjoyable. The Magnite CVT is peppy and you can maintain triple digit speeds all day long on the expressway. Want quicker response? Use the Sport mode. You can access Sport mode by pressing a small button placed just below the gear knob. This mode never lets the engine revvs drop below ~2,000 rpm. As a result, the motor is kept on the boil & power is always available when you touch the accelerator. You can have a good deal of fun in Sport mode. It comes in handy on mountain roads & for overtaking too. The CVT has an ""L"" mode which should be used on inclines, steep mountain roads and wherever you really need engine braking. Mind you, it's not a 1st gear mode. L mode goes all the way to 120 km/h and beyond. Like the MT, Nissan has equipped the Magnite CVT with cruise control, ESP + traction control and hill start assist. The CVT is indisputably the superior choice on the Magnite. It is class-leading in some ways (including smoothness), while the MT feels clunky & cumbersome: Button to engage Sport mode is hidden just below the gear knob. Owners better be informed of the same, else most will miss it! Out of sight, out of mind: Footwell gets a dead pedal, but its brick-like design looks sad. Further, we felt it was placed too much in the front: Suspension The Magnite comes with a McPherson strut suspension with stabiliser bar at the front and twin tube telescopic shock absorbers at the rear. Ride Comfort While almost all the crossovers in this segment have a firm edge to the ride (due to their height), the low speed ride quality of the Magnite is even firmer than you would expect! While the ride is still liveable, it is a far cry from the Honda WR-V which is the best in this field. Even medium-sized potholes make their presence felt inside. Urban ride comfort will be the biggest complaint of Magnite owners. The ride feels a little more comfortable on the expressway, but never plush. Blame this partly on the 36 PSI tyre pressure that is recommended by Nissan. We tried dropping it to 32 PSI and while that did improve matters, we still felt everything on the road! Nissan should have softened things for imperfect Indian roads. All variants of the Magnite are equipped with 16"" wheels shod with 195/60 section rubber. I have also mentioned earlier that the car’s tyres could have been taller. This would have ensured that the wheel wells would be filled and improved the ride quality as well. Just for reference, the Kia Sonet's tyres offer a 12 mm taller sidewall which helps the looks + comfort levels. Handling & Dynamics As is the case with most monocoque crossovers, the Magnite is very easy & car-like to drive, whether in the city or on the highway. On the open road, straight line stability at high speeds is satisfactory. The car doesn’t feel twitchy over bumps & undulations. Coming to handling, the Magnite’s firm suspension helps. The car remains composed even when pushed through corners. While there is some body roll, it's not excessive. You can even hustle the car through a series of twisty roads confidently. All the turbo-petrol variants are equipped with ESP which can be a life-saver in an emergency manouveur. Wheels & Tyres Grip from the 195/60 Ceat SecuraDrive tyres is acceptable for the average Joe. Those with a more aggressive driving style however, will want to upgrade to stickier rubber. Steering The electric power steering is light and smooth at parking / city speeds. Along with its small size, this makes for a very easy car to drive in urban conditions. Further, its turning radius of 5.0 m is the tightest in the segment. On the highway, the steering weighs up enough and is never nervous or overtly sensitive. On the flip side, enthusiasts will find the steering to be slow, vague & having weight that's too artificial. Ground Clearance The Magnite comes with an unladen ground clearance rating of 205 mm, which is second only to the Tata Nexon (209 mm). This is more than enough to take on the worst of Indian roads. Braking The Magnite is equipped with disc brakes at the front and drums at the rear, with ABS + EBD and hydraulic brake assist (HBA). The brakes perform as expected. Do note that the second half of the brake pedal travel is quite sensitive, this will take a couple of km to get used to.", 21st October 2020,Mumbai,17476,75369,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

This is the big departure from the concept video they share earlier. No red+black combo either. 6. Strange colour scheme for the seats. What colour is that? Some sort of choco-brown? 7.

Coming to the car, it looks decent and I always liked Nissans feature selection and distribution. Best thing? It comes in Black! But like one of the reviewers said, there is no USP in this car since its driveability is unknown. Price is the only trick they have and IMO it will be priced on par with B segment hatches a la Ignis. Whats needed to be seen is how it stacks up against Tata HBX and the Renault Kiger. It seems decent but is it enough? Both these rivals wont be far behind but going by history Tata most surely wont launch the turbo petrol or automatic on launch. Also I'm not sure if the Kiger would be equipped with an AMT or CVT, and even if that will be available on launch, as this engine is yet to make its way into the Triber which as of now comes with an AMT. Its also interesting to note that other manufacturers are yet to announce a rival in this segment. Anyway it would be interesting to see how the market reacts to these BSUVs.

Two things - it is based on the same architecture as the Triber and the interior, even though well equipped, looks low rent. But what I am not sure is the premium they are going to charge for that Turbo CVT. That's the highlight - the main USP in a segment flooded with lame petrol engines and AMT transmissions. But Nissan shouldn't get carried away do what Renault did with the re-refreshed Duster. On that one, all variants are priced well except for the Turbo CVT. Everyone here is on the Hyundai/ Kia bandwagon and it looks like nothing can stop them - even severe reliability/ safety issues are being brushed off. I have said this before. In this country, certain brands and vehicles can get away with anything. So, Nissan will have to offer quite a lot MORE while charging quite a lot LESS.

The Infotainment screen - it was always expected to have a more down to earth screen. So this is not a letdown for me. 2. The colour scheme - the red+black mixed design was looking more upmarket. Even a black+beige combination would have worked better in the production version. But more importantly, it is the fit and finish and quality of materials. The lustrous finish on the concept is replaced with hard plastics of reality - and it clearly shows in the pictures. Top of the dashboard is particularly evident here - see how the light reflects on the hard plastic dash near the central AC vents and right side of the driver console.

I don't understand how another 1 good product is going to solve that problem. To consider buying a Nissan car today, one needs to be in a in a T1 city where the last dealership is likely to close only when Nissan exits India. Also one needs to have a good FNG that services Renault/Nissan cars in the worst case scenario that Nissan exits(parts should most likely be available due to the alliance). If these constraints are met then the initial price differential has to be a large enough to offset the low resale value. Finally comes the product which has to be better than the competition. It seems there are so many ifs and constraints to seriously consider the Nissan magnite no matter how good it is. I suspect mass Indian market will not satisfy a lot of above conditions.

I do not think it will be that easy to breathe down the SWIFT's neck. It's not solely the pricing and sales experience but the overall user / owner ""feel"" of the product. That low slung stance, the super - comfy front seats, the ""flick - of - the - wrist"" gearshift action, the eager turn-in, the sharp part throttle response and the raspy induction note - all come together to make the Swift what it is. Agreed the steering calibration is a dodo but then we can't win all. And then the crown jewel which is the SWIFT's Suzuki K-12 four cylinder gasoline engine. To those who love to drive and to those who do not and view driving as a mere commute from point A to point B, the Suzuki K-12 will not disappoint either of them. The smoothness, the ""revv-ability"", the reliability and the fuel efficiency of the powertrain is truly impressive and dare i say , top of the heap , in the 1.2Litre engine's segment in India. From tootling around at city speeds in traffic, to red-lining it on open highways, the K-12 was; is; and will remain a joy to drive. This Jekyll and Hyde character is so strong that once you get hooked to it, you mentally tend to benchmark this powertrain against others. (And that is precisely what Peugeot - Citroen is doing, benchmarking their ""yet to be launched"" 1.2L with the K-12) Compared to the K-12; the 3-cylinder , the 1-litre that powers the KWID and the Triber and now which will power the Magnite, (albeit with a turbo), will have a tough time to establish its credentials.

Kia and Hyundai had mixed up so many engines and transmission for one single car. Earlier, car makers only have few sorted variants and only change visible engine based on fuel type P or D. Later came the Transmission option of Manual or Automatic and nothing more. Nissan or any others except Kia- Hyundai does not give you so many masala of Engine, transmission with variant combinations confusing the customers. Its a gamble for everyone by losing some thing or other. Days will be gone for manufactures offering cross badging ie Duster/Kicks, Venue/Sonet, Rapid/Vento, Breeza/Urban cruiser. That is same platform and engine but design and brand different with prices almost closest. Latest trend is swarmed by kia Hyundai that is to mix up the internals while the external design being same for a single car. Price the car with variant starting, say 6 lakhs and add up masala ( engine, different transmission) with gizmos to arrive top model for double the price at 12 lakhs, eg Sonet, Seltos. Bingo! a smart way to earn profits. Magnite variant classification is simple, 2 engines, 2 transmissions with 3 main variant XL, XV, XV premium. XE- the entry variant is just to price attractively and pull crowd and XV(0) is just a dual tone option. Tech pack as informed officially during launch is an accessory and will not be classified as variant.

Pretty straightforward then that they will have two engine options when the other manufacturers have three. 2 transmissions - yes. A simple manual and a CVT (hopefully better than the infamous CVT that bombed in the US market). But I actually kind of like KIA providing transmissions that suit each engines character - A DCT with an explosive Turbo petrol for enthusiasts, a reliable TC with a Turbo diesel for mile-munchers and a simple manual with a NA petrol for people who just want a city commuter. As for the variants, Sonet most popular ones would probably be HTK+, HTX and GTX+ (considering the small price premium between this and the HTX+). Again, comes out to be three main ones.

Guess is Nissan would price it at 4.xx lakh, just to have the ""4"" number registered in minds. Similarly the anemic NA engine is only to cut costs, so no point putting the (O) pack there - sensible decision. To be frank, I am surprised Nissan is providing the Tech pack option on this engine. And then there is the HRA0 engine - 4 variants, 1 add on pack applicable to 3 of the variants, and 2 transmissions. Very simple in perspective with today's world where all sorts overlaps, mutually exclusive features and confusion between the variants prevail.

And this automatic gearbox is not even a proper automatic box; it is an AMT unit, which is much inferior in terms of feel compared to traditional automatics. As for the Mahindra XUV300, its petrol version doesn't even get an automatic transmission option and its top-end variant still costs 13.3 lakhs. The top-end petrol automatic variant of the Nissan Magnite, on the other hand, is expected to cost around 11 lakhs on-road (as far as media reports suggest). Plus, you get a proper CVT automatic with this car. So, Nissan Magnite is around 2.5 lakhs cheaper and also offers better gearbox. And it's not easy for any car manufacturer to achieve that. It will obviously have to cut corners some place or the other. In terms of Nissan Magnite, the brand might have done so by cutting corners on the thickness of metal. And I think it's only fair. You can't have your cake and eat it too, at least in this segment of cars. If one wants a safer car, they can go with the Mahindra XUV300 or Tata Nexon or likes of them. However, if you want a car that's cheaper by 2.5 lakhs and also offers a better gearbox (along with a similar feature set as costlier cars), get the Nissan Magnite. If Nissan would have used thicker metal for the Magnite (and thereby offer a heavy and stronger vehicle), it would have had to cut down on features, engine, or gearbox to keep the cost low. And then people would have complained that the Magnite doesn't offer as many features as the competition. If Nissan would have used thicker metal for the Magnite and also cramped in all the features, the car would have been costlier (similar or most costlier than Mahindra XUV300 and Tata Nexon). And then most people would have said that they don't prefer to buy a Nissan at that price point over Tata, Mahindra, Hyundai, or Kia. Having a stronger car is always better. But if someone prefers a better gearbox and more features, the Nissan Magnite is the one for them. However, if one can compromise on gearbox and also willing to spend 2.5 lakhs more, they can look at other options in the market. It all depends on what an individual prefers.

I totally agree with your point. ESP, I believe, is the most important safety feature in a car. It is way more important than airbags or thickness of the metal used for the car. I would any day prefer a car with ESP that has less airbags over a car without ESP that has more airbags. Airbag is a passive safety feature in a car accident; it deploys when the car crashes to prevent passengers from hitting their head on a hard surface to avoid injury. ESP, on the other hand, is an active safety feature in a car accident; it intelligently brakes each wheel depending upon the steering input and car's movement to force the car to go in the direction that driver desires thus avoiding a crash. ESP saves you in imaginable ways. India is country where there are many inconsistencies on road with regards to traffic. Anyone can come on the road from anywhere. And this is where the ESP comes in. It helps you maneuver your car in the right way, away from the harm. If there is no crash, there is no need for airbags or thick metal. Technologies that avoid crash, in my opinion, are more important than technologies that reduce the impact of a crash on passengers. After all, prevention is better than cure (I know this phrase doesn't exactly match in this situation but you get what I'm trying to say). I am in no way saying that airbags or thickness of metal doesn't matter. Those things do matter. But what I'm saying is ESP, and of course, other vehicle dynamics matter more (at least in majority of cases). Since the Magnite has ESP, I think it will be very safe on the road. In my opinion, it is much safer than every car that is on the road that lacks ESP (In most cases). Take Hyundai Creta and Kia Seltos for example. Only their top-end variants come with ESP. That's a shame, in my opinion. You spend 17 lakhs on top-second variant of these cars and you still don't get ESP. Magnite, on the other hand, offers ESP at 11 lakhs. Of course, even Magnite doesn't offer ESP in its base variant. But the thing is the top-end variant with ESP will just cost you 11 lakhs, which is much cheaper than 17-lakh worth variant of Hyundai Creta or Kia Seltos that lack ESP. Sadly, most people in India don't talk about ESP. I think Indian government should've made ESP a compulsion rather than airbags. But I guess that would've increased the cost of cars. So I think the decision from Indian government is only fair. Moreover, ESP is said to become mandatory in India from 2023. I eagerly waiting for that day. Also, if anyone of you don't know how ESP works (I'm guessing most people know), please watch this video.

Govt of India is making ESP mandatory in all new cars from 2023 which is very welcome move. This will save thousands of lives every year by avoiding accidents. Personally, I will always prefer ""crash avoidance"" system rather than ""crash support"" system in my car. I will try to avoid crash/accidents always rather than being in such scenario.

As for hard plastics and a few cheap looking components, I'm totally okay with it considering the price of the car and the features that it offers (I don't mean just convenience features; I mean safety features too).

227, 84.monsoon , 11:41 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Excellent pricing, overall. As I had anticipated and posted earlier, the often touted ""Autocar"" price range of 5.5 - 7.5 lakhs was for the NA range and the Turbo and CVT version are priced well over that range. Nissan continues to offer amazing value for city dwellers who have low running, are highly value conscious, want all the creature comforts and bling features, but do not crave power and cutting edge drivetrain technology. The Magnite 1.0 NA Petrol XV is the King of the Hill for offering incredible value for such customers, at 6.75 lakhs!. It has unbelievable features for the price - rear camera, fully digital 7"" instrument cluster, LED DRLs, LED front fog lamps, push button start, auto air-conditioner, electrically foldable outside mirrors, actual usable roof rails (instead of the strictly cosmetic ones on the Sonet), diamond cut 16-inch alloy wheels, hands-free entry with iKey, 60:40 rear seat split (not available in Sonet), nice touchscreen systems with Android Auto and Apple Car Play, plus all the basics (including the much wanted rear washer and wiper which is missing in all but the highest trims of the Korean cousins). The 5m turning radius is best in class for convenience of the city drivers. Another example of exemplary value for this customer segment from Nissan is the Kicks 1.5 NA XV Version - a proper mid-size SUV will all these features and more at 9.99 lakhs! However, I feel the premium for a Turbo Petrol engine over the NA engine (1 lakh) for equivalent trims is a bit too much. The Kia Sonet HTK+ 1.2 NA Manual is 8.45 lakhs and the HTK+ 1.0 Turbo IMT is 9.49 lakhs - A premium of 1.04 lakhs for:A Direct injected Turbo charged Engine (Not a Multiport injected turbo like in the Magnite) Significantly higher power and torque (118 BHP 172 NM) An iMT gearbox included in the price premium - this is worth at least 25K I feel Nissan could have kept the premium for the turbo engine to be around 75K and premium for CVT to be about 50K. Else, they could have kept the premium but offered the full blown HR10 DDT with 117 PS and 200 NM instead of the HR10 DET with 100 PS and 160 NM. This way, the Magnite Turbo would have surpassed the Sonet turbo on Torque (200 NM instead of 170 NM) and matched it on power output. For those looking for the best value Turbo CVT variant (other than the sedate city drivers for whom the XV NA version as described above is the absolute steal) - XV CVT at 8.65 lakhs seems best. It has all but the following features on the XV Premium - 360 degree camera, connected car features, TPMS, LED Headlamp, some chrome bits, all black interior, rear AC vents, and center armrest. Presence of Cruise control on XV is not clear, at one place the brochure seems to say it has it (cruise control indicator on center console), somewhere else it says it is not present. From the specs it is clear that the torque output has been reduced to 152 NM for the CVT version (instead of 160 NM on the manual) - see attached table. This is probably because of the limitation of the CVT gearbox in terms of how much torque it can handle. I think this will make the CVT version significantly slower than the manual version, with the twin factors of reduction of torque + natural power loss due to the auto transmission. The ARAI fuel efficiency for the CVT is also down by 2.3 KMPL compared to the manual (17.7 KPL instead of 20 KPL). Another irritant for those who do frequent long distance highway trips and are looking for a compact, peppy, automatic car with good mileage and range is the fact that the Magnite only has a 40 L fuel tank - Coupled with low real world highway mileage of around 13 KMPL one would expect at 100-110 KPH speeds, the range for the Turbo CVT would be limited to about 520KM. Compare that to the Sonet Diesel AT which should deliver 17-18 KPL and has a 45 litre fuel tank, taking the range to almost 800 KMs. Now, if only the Sonet was more reasonably priced with the HTK+ Diesel AT at around 9.99 lakhs!

This would give a distinct advantage over Maruti and Hyundai. b) After Sales Service- Nissan should ramp up their service standards. Nissan might want to consider offering longer manufacturer warranty(say 4 to 5 years) and extended warranty for further 3/2 years (ie.upto 7th year) at nominal cost.

Safety is something which no one cares about. People might at most might say something about strong built and the thud when doors close or the weight of the bonnet. That's why the Nexon or XUV 300 never became half as successful as the Brezza. However all cars in this segment are fantastic and have their own USP and the magnite is no different And man, not only aftersales but even sales is going to be a big challenge. While most dealers of Nissan have already closed and others on the verge of closure, even in big cities finding a dealership is difficult. Tried my Luck in Noida sec 63 dealership and it was closed. Even the one near my home in Kolkata situated in BT road has permanently shut shop. I hear there's only one service provider left in Mumbai city. Not sure about sales! However what my concern primarily is with the Nissan Magnite turbo petrol is that the Peak torque is too narrow and too late in the rev range.

A wireless charger, air purifier, ambient mood lighting, puddle lamps and JBL speakers will be available with the Tech Pack. One could only complain about the missing sunroof, which no Japanese manufacturer in the country provides. So this was expected Second concern is the pathetic fit finish of Nissan cars. I am okay with the ergonomics of Nissan cars. Recently came across a customer review of Nissan Kicks and here's what the owner had to say https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BZI...el=MotorOctane I am sure, our members using Nissan cars have their own share of feedback about the brand and all is not bad.

So the body-shell height is quite low. How did they pull off the space with such a narrow and short body-shell? My gut feel is tghe difference in height may be due to the inclusion or exclusion of the roof rails in height measurement. Hyundai and Kia always include them in the height measurement. I am not sure if Nissan does. The Magnite has a functional roof rail in every variant and this can contribute to 30-40 mm of additional height. If Nissan has excluded the roof rail in height measurement, once it is included, the height will be more or less on par with the rest of the pack.

Although they can be implemented without an AT, it would be harder for Nissan to implement them on both types of transmission (MT Turbo and CVT Turbo).

Quote: Originally Posted by Godzilla Nissan brand has got the maximum awards for 2020 from JD power. One of the most trusted surveys. Okay I need to clear the air regarding Nissan’s Jatco CVT. Please don’t blindly trust JD Power as they are just another biased survey like most of the rest. Nissan CVTs, while smooth & fuel efficient, have a major draw back and that’s longevity. However, for the Indian context, that longevity is relative. They usually start slipping & breaking down post 200,000kms. A figure which most private owners in India won’t cross. Nissan’s CVT (Jatco) is still much, much inferior to the Toyota (Aisin) & Honda CVTs. However, it’s still leagues ahead of some of the others. Abroad however, transmissions are expected to last well over 1,000,000kms, over the life of the vehicle. Hence the label of unreliable transmissions as 200,000kms is well short of the typical expected life of the transmission. So, for the Indian use case, the Nissan CVT may be sufficiently reliable for a typical ownership period of 10yrs/100,000kms. However please don’t go by surveys as they are mostly clueless. You can’t label a 2020 technology reliable, because frankly, it’s way too early to tell. Give it 5-10yrs, and feedback from thousands of owners. If it still holds up well, then sure, its reliable. My own 2010 Micra CVT is still going strong at 170,000kms with the original engine & transmission. But I’m well aware of what to expect after 200,000kms.

It's good that Nissan have introduced the 100 PS turbo+CVT combination right from the start, instead of pushing the 72 PS NA+AMT combination like Renault are doing with the Triber. I dislike AMTs, including the relatively smooth one from Hyundai. My only grouses are the presence of only 2 airbags (Triber has additional side airbags) and a stupid, slim rear bumper that offers very little protection to the rear hatch.

I have a 2019 BS-4 version which is running on 195/65-R16 The top variant rides on 215/60-R16. Honestly speaking, 215mm tread width may be a bit of an overkill for the car as it does not have ""that"" much power to overwhelm the chassis/mechanical grip. Outright grip on my friend's top model Nexon feels a bit more, but the trade-off is that, the low speed ride is definitely ""jigglier"" compared to the 195mm shod Nexon's.

Especially in bad roads. On bad roads, you are likely to experience higher vertical movement but less lateral movement. Cornering will be better due to the higher grip. However, with just an adequate level of power in the Magnite engine, that is also lower in torque compared to other turbo petrol rivals, you are likely to experience a loss of grunt and the fuel economy will also be adversely affected. This is where you see each manufacturer take a specific stance to cater to their end customer preferences. Honda uses the narrowest possible tires (and the smallest possible fuel tank) in its cars to maximise fuel economy and overcome the mid-range power deficit of its NA petrol engines. TATA, on the other hand, generally uses wider tires thanks to its SUV heritage. Hyundai is making a transition from generally providing smaller and thinner wheels to providing wide and large tires on its SUV family.

In Magnite, Nissan is using XTRONIC CVT which is newer technology over conventional CVT. As per their claim, they have improved the electronic control system and the hydraulic system components. Apart from it, inclusion of a high-performance ATF (Automatic Transmission Fluid) enhances response and stability which is resulting 30% faster shifts ratios than the previous version. With this, Nissan's XTRONIC CVT technology provides instantaneous response to the driver's intention, in addition to a natural feeling of powerful acceleration. Two cents from my own experience.

349, Aditya , 19:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"After a slew of slow-selling models, Nissan hopes to make a mark in India by entering one of the most popular and growing segments in the market. Yes, with the Magnite, the company has decided to step into the C2 sub-4 m crossover segment, which has some of the most successful models in the country including the Maruti Vitara Brezza, Ford EcoSport, Tata Nexon and the fairly new Hyundai Venue + Kia Sonet. This is also the first full-on launch of Nissan bossman Rakesh Srivastava, who is widely considered as an industry genius. The Magnite could be the last throw of the dice for Nissan in India, because if it doesn't succeed in this lucrative segment, it is not likely to survive at all. This makes the Magnite an important car for the company. You can expect it to be well-priced and aggressively marketed. I spent a day with the Nissan Magnite. My quick & brief observations below: Nissan have done a good job with the overall design of the Magnite. It is a lot more attractive than the quirky designs that they have been dishing out over the years. The interior too is spacious and well designed. Features such as the rear defogger and wiper are available across the variant lineup and features such as wireless Android Auto / Apple CarPlay and 360 degree camera are available. On the flip side, many of the features available in its competitors such as auto headlamps and auto wipers are missing while the overall quality of the interior is not up to the standards set by the Koreans. The list of engines is also limited to just a 1.0L, 3-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol and a 1.0L, 3-cylinder turbo-petrol. While the former comes with a 5-speed manual gearbox only, the latter gets a 5-speed MT as well as a continuously variable transmission (CVT). There's no diesel option available. The prices and other details of the Magnite are scheduled to be revealed on December 2, 2020. Exterior The car looks good from every angle. It’s a lot more eye-catching than the past cars from Nissan. Many other road users wanted more than just a second look. While I was taking pictures, lots of people stopped to inquire about the car. The only things I did not like was the excessive use of chrome at the front, around the radiator grille and that the tyres are a size too short; they do not fill the large wheel arches sufficiently. Coming to build quality, the bonnet, hatch & doors are light (as has been the case with all Nissans sold in India). The paint quality and fit & finish are good. Shut lines are consistent, but could have been a touch tighter. Smart front end is dominated by a huge radiator grille which looks heavily influenced by the design used by Datsun. Thick chrome border isn't to my liking. Notice how the front bumper panel stretches around the grille, and all the way up to the bonnet: Rear end features split LED tail-lamps and bold ""MAGNITE"" lettering on the tailgate. Exhaust pipe is nicely concealed under the bumper. We like the styling: Bulky sides feature flared, square wheel arches, lots of cuts and creases and plastic cladding to give the Magnite a rugged appearance. Tyres look too short & small: ORVMs get integrated LED turn-indicators. Cameras for the 360 degree viewing system are placed below. You can even get puddle lamps as a part of the optional Tech Pack (available only on the XV and XV Premium variants): There's a prominent haunch that originates on the rear door and runs across the rear panel, merging into the tail-lamp. You can see this in the ORVM Interior Ingress & egress are easier than in hatchbacks or low-slung sedans. On the inside, there are no soft touch plastics used anywhere. As mentioned earlier, quality wise, it is acceptable but not up to the standard set by the Koreans. It does not feel as well screwed together either. The black dashboard with silver and piano black inserts looks good. Space is very good and the ergonomics are spot-on. It doesn't take long to get comfortable in the driver's seat. The driver's seat offers enough support, but the armrest is not adjustable, which will render it useless for shorter drivers. At the rear, there is a good deal of space. Seat height is comfortable too. As with most new cars, the Magnite's head-unit is tablet-like and sticks out from the front of the dashboard. It's an 8-inch unit with NissanConnect telematics, wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and a 6-speaker sound system. Sound quality is average. The climate control is very effective and chilled the interior in seconds, even on a hot day. The rear air-vents help matters further. Black dashboard with silver and piano black inserts. We like the overall design. As expected for this segment, the plastics on the dashboard are all hard. While part quality is acceptable, it's not as impressive as a Hyundai or Kia: Leather-wrapped 3-spoke steering wheel with grey stitching and thumb contours looks premium. Buttons for operating the entertainment and telephone are located on the left spoke, while those for the MID and cruise control are placed on the right spoke. Steering has rake adjustment only: 7"" TFT instrument cluster is fully digital with temperature and fuel gauges on the sides, a speedometer in the middle, a revv-counter around it, two trip meters and an odometer. You can switch views to see average and instant fuel consumption, FE history and a tyre pressure monitoring system. MID displays the specific door that is open. While it covers the tailgate, the bonnet is left out: All-black doorpad has hard plastics. Armrest area gets softer, fabric insert with white stitching. Door handle is finished in silver and so is the side of the power window console. Don't miss the outdated pull / push type door locks at the top. Door pockets can hold a 1L bottle and other knick knacks. Front speaker is housed in the doorpad as well: Smart-looking black fabric seats with leatherette on the sides, adjustable headrests and side bolstering. Driver's seat is adjustable for height. A driver armrest has been provided, but it is not adjustable. Cabin width is healthy for this segment: ORVMs are wide + tall and provide a good view of the action behind. You can see the haunch on the rear panel of the car in them: Day / Night manually-adjustable IRVM is wide enough to cover the rear windshield. Auto-dimming function is not provided: Center fascia has a prominent tilt towards the driver. Hexagonal air-con vents get thick silver borders: Bird's eye view of the center console. 2 large cupholders are located next to the handbrake: Big, 10L glovebox has compartments and illumination: Rear seat is wide, but still, more suitable for 2 adults and a child, rather than 3 adults. While the seatbase is largely flat, the seatbacks have some contours to hold you in place. Two adjustable headrests as well as ISOFIX child seat anchors on both sides have been provided. A center armrest with cupholders and a smartphone holder is given: Adequate legroom for 2 tall dudes to sit one behind the other. Floor hump is not prominent and the center console doesn't eat into the 5th occupant's kneeroom. Front seats are scooped out to liberate more space: Rear air-con vents & a 12V power outlet: 336L boot is fairly sized. Boot comes with illumination and a bag hook on both sides. A parcel tray with a prominent border has been provided as well: Folding the rear seat down gives you 690 liters of cargo capacity: Rear seat is split in a 60:40 ratio - handy when you want to carry a combination of luggage and passengers: Driving the 1.0L Turbo-Petrol MT 1.0L turbo-petrol engine puts out 99 BHP & 160 Nm: The Magnite is powered by a 999cc, 3-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine. Called the HRA0, this engine produces 99 BHP and 160 Nm, which is healthy, but there are rivals which offer more power. The car weighs 1,014 kg. This gives it a power to weight ratio of 98 BHP / ton and a torque to weight ratio of 158 Nm / ton. While the former is not as high as some of the Magnite's rivals, the latter is better than the cars in the segment. There is enough grunt in this engine to keep most drivers happy. On startup, being a 3-cylinder, there is slight body shake and some vibrations come into the cabin. Faint vibrations are felt on the steering, pedals and the driver's seat. On the move, there are some vibrations felt on the gear knob as well. While none of these is particularly annoying, refinement is not as impressive as some of the recent 3-cylinder motors we have driven. The Magnite moves off from a standstill in a clean manner. Despite the turbocharger + small engine size, driveability is good and power delivery is user-friendly. The turbo-petrol has a good low end and can pull from even ~1,000 rpm. With a bit of modulation of the clutch, the car can set off in 2nd gear as well. Some lag is there of course, yet it's minimal & well-controlled. That said, you have to be a little patient when pulling from low rpms in 2nd gear. You won’t need to downshift much in the city. The only time you are likely to feel the turbo lag is on an incline or if you need to suddenly close a gap in traffic. The engine starts coming into its stride above 1,750 rpm. Around town, it can cruise at 40 km/h in 3rd gear with the engine spinning at ~ 1,650 rpm without a problem. Above 2,250 rpm, the engine comes into its power band and you can make good progress. The open road is where you'll really enjoy this engine. The mid-range is strong with a good surge of power till ~5,750 rpm. Throttle response is crisp too. Keep the revvs in the powerband and the Magnite becomes a quick highway cruiser. The engine revvs till 6,500 rpm after which the fuel supply cuts off. By then however, power has started tapering off and you will have already shifted up. Driveability is good and you won't find the need to downshift often, although there is some lag in the higher gears. So, while passing slow moving vehicles on undivided highways, it is better to downshift, use the mid-range and fly past them. In 5th gear, the car can cruise at 100 km/h & 120 km/h at ~2,300 rpm & ~2,800 rpm respectively. The Magnite is equipped with 'hill-start assist'. Stop on an incline, the car will hold itself in place and not roll back giving the driver enough time to get his foot off the brake pedal and onto the accelerator. The 5-speed gearbox is light & sure-slotting with medium length throws. I found the shift action to be a little too notchy for my liking. The clutch has medium weight and its travel range is on the longer side. Coming to NVH levels, the Magnite does well at slow speeds and around town. Upon revving, you can hear that familiar 3-cylinder thrum, yet this noise is not excessive. Even while cruising on the highway, the engine is audible, but not irritating. It's above 5,000 rpm that the engine gets loud. Wind noise is controlled at 100 km/h, while road and tyre noise are par for the course. Insulation sheet under the bonnet: While there is some underbody protection provided, it does not stretch back a long way: Gear shifter gets a glossy black top, silver border and faux leather boot. While the knob looks great, the finish around it could be better. The leather boot feels cheap and outdated: A-B-C pedals are well positioned. No dead pedal provided though & the narrow footwell doesn't leave you space to rest your left foot: Driving the 1.0L Turbo-Petrol CVT The Magnite turbo-petrol also comes with a CVT (continuously variable transmission) Automatic. It's good to see Nissan give a proper automatic gearbox instead of an AMT like some other manufacturers. A CVT has less moving parts than a conventional AT, is lighter and brings a smooth driving experience. However, CVTs also suffer from the rubber-band effect wherein hard throttle input will lead to revs rising with no corresponding increase in speed. While this behaviour is present in the Magnite, Nissan has done well to smoothen the experience. The Magnite AT gets a Sport mode as well, but not a manual mode or paddle shifters. Like the MT, the turbo-petrol in the CVT produces 99 BHP. However, unlike the MT, the peak torque has been restricted to 152 Nm. To start the car, put your foot on the brake pedal and press the starter button. Take your foot off the brake pedal and the vehicle starts crawling. This means you can drive the car with just the brake pedal in stop & go traffic (no need to press the accelerator). The Magnite CVT provides a seamless experience in the city. As there aren't any actual gearshifts taking place, the drive feels butter-smooth. Forget AMTs, even torque converter & dual-clutch ATs cannot touch a CVT for smoothness. By CVT standards, throttle response is good and the infamous rubber-band effect is well controlled when driven with a light foot. That said, even when you get aggressive, the engine and transmission respond fairly well compared to some other CVTs. This is easily one of the better CVTs in the market. The light steering, smooth transmission and good all-round visibility make the Magnite an easy car to drive in city traffic. On the open road, the turbocharged engine makes sure that the Magnite CVT is not left behind by other cars. Response time is fair. With CVTs, gradual acceleration is preferred over hard runs. Floor the accelerator abruptly and all you'll see is a rise in engine rpms and noise. It’s not very long before the speed rises as well. The rubber-band effect is present when you drive aggressively, but not as bad as I have seen in some other cars (like the Baleno CVT). Want a quicker response? Use the Sport mode. You can access Sport mode by pressing a small button placed just below the gear knob. This mode never lets the engine revvs drop below ~2,100 rpm. As a result, the engine is kept on the boil & power is always available when you touch the accelerator. You can have a good deal of fun in Sport mode. It comes in handy on mountain roads & for overtaking too. The CVT has an ""L"" mode which keeps the gearbox in 1st gear; this is best for steep ascents or descents. Like the MT, Nissan has equipped the Magnite CVT with cruise control, ESP + traction control and hill start assist. Black & silver gear knob. Gearbox gets ""L"" and Sport modes: Button to engage Sport mode is hidden just below the gear knob. Owners better be informed of the same, else most will miss it! Out of sight, out of mind: Footwell gets a useful dead pedal, but its brick-like design looks sad: Ride & Handling The Magnite comes with a McPherson strut suspension with stabiliser bar at the front and twin tube telescopic shock absorbers at the rear. While almost all the crossovers in this segment have a firm edge to the ride (due to their height), the low speed ride quality of the Magnite is even firmer than we would expect! While the ride quality is still liveable, it is a far cry from the Honda WR-V which is the best in this field. Even medium-sized potholes make their presence felt inside. The ride feels a little more comfortable on the expressway, but never plush. Blame this partly on the 36 PSI tyre pressure that is recommended by Nissan (32 PSI should noticeably improve matters in the city). All variants of the Magnite are equipped with 16"" wheels shod with 195/60 section rubber. I have also mentioned earlier that the car’s tyres could have been taller. This would have ensured that the wheel wells would be filled and improved the ride quality as well. Just for reference, the Kia Sonet's tyres offer a 12 mm taller sidewall which helps the looks + comfort levels. As is the case with most monocoque crossovers, the Magnite is very easy & car-like to drive, whether in the city or on the highway. On the open road, straight line stability at high speeds is satisfactory. The car doesn’t feel twitchy over bumps & undulations. Coming to handling, the Magnite’s firm suspension helps. The car remains composed even when pushed through fast corners. While there is some body roll, it's well controlled. You can even hustle the car through a series of twisty roads confidently. Dynamically, the car is sorted. All the turbo-petrol variants of the car are equipped with ESP which can be a life-saver in an emergency manouveur. Grip from the 195/60 Ceat SecuraDrive tyres is acceptable for the average Joe. Those with a more aggressive driving style however, will want to upgrade to stickier rubber. The electric power steering is light and smooth at parking / city speeds. Along with its small size, this makes for a very easy car to drive in urban conditions. Further, its turning radius of 5.0 m is the tightest in the segment. On the highway, the steering weighs up well and is never nervous or overtly sensitive. The Magnite comes with an unladen ground clearance rating of 205 mm, which is second only to the Tata Nexon (209 mm). This is more than enough to take on the worst of Indian roads. The Magnite is equipped with disc brakes at the front and drums at the rear, with ABS + EBD and hydraulic brake assist (HBA). The brakes perform as expected.", 20th November 2020,Mumbai,17476,75369,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

My only grouses are the unnecessarily firm ride quality at lower speeds, the lack of additional airbags and that useless rear bumper. Otherwise, it's a very good package for the expected price tag. The addition of a turbocharger (no GDi though) seems to have transformed the 3-pot 1.0 litre into a good performer. I remember the complaint in the Triber review about the uninspiring engine performance. The CVT also seems to be well-tuned and mated beautifully to the 1.0 turbo-petrol.

Only space lacking would be safety. This could have been their USP even before GNCAP testing by pulling of a Yaris and offering >2 airbags as a standard from the base model. I personally I only used Nissans overseas as rented cars and they have been really good experiences. Really hope Nissan get to a point in india where they are able to get world class vehicles into india and have the customers and sales and service network to make it possible. Comparing the competitions build quality to Kia and Hyundai is a two way street. One should also then mention / compare their brakes as that is a more basic and critical feature.

12, Deadpool , 10:43 ,BHPian,"After seeing at least a dozen Youtube reviews in last 2 days, I have found almost all reviewers are on the same page about the below: Pros - Striking exterior look. Its one of the best looking C-SUV and a head turner. - The X-Tronic CVT is beautifully mated with the 1 lit 3 cylinder turbo pot. It's a breeze to drive this in both city and highway specially in city with less turbo lag. - X-Tronic CVT is much less rubbery than the conventional CVT. - Good ride quality. - Class leading back seat space in terms of leg room and knee room without compromising boot space. Kudos to Nissan engineering team for carving out so much space even though Magnite is one of the narrowest and shortest in the segment. - Feature loaded which will certainly appeal mass market. - functional roof rail which support till 50kgs. Most of the C-SUVs are having it for show-off. Cons - Light steering although a boon in city but feels disconnected in highway drive. Feedback is not good. I hope Nissan will improve this. - Slight vibration when engine is idling. Improvement scope for refinement. - Engine becomes vocal over 4500-5000 rpm. It's creating lots of cabin noise. Insulation can be improved. - Slight body roll at high speed cornering. I am astonished to see, very less reviewers have mentioned about the safety features provided in Magnite - specially ESP, rear defogger and wiper(standard) something the Korean duo has converted into premium features in India over the years. No new product can be 100% perfect, having said that, it seems that Magnite has ticked all the boxes that Indian consumers are looking at this price point in this heavily contested segment. With news of showrooms slowly opening up nationwide and Industry genius Rakesh Srivastava behind the project, my gut feeling is, Magnite can pull off the sinking ship of Nissan in India.", 22nd November 2020,Kolkata,123,801,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

33, GrammarNazi , 10:23 ,Senior - BHPian,"Hope people rely largely on Team-BHPs unbioased review & also search around the net to make their own informed judgement by driving the car themselves. Many auto-Journos on YouTube & social media seem to be making contradictory observations & passing random uninformed ""cautionary"" ramblings devoid of even basic research, with their ""reviews"" of the Magnite. Platform : Stellar platform allowed the design engineers to ensure the space within the car is optimised in a brilliant way. The Magnite being based on the same platform as Triber with parts shared has given Nissan the ability to keep costs in check. At this price point, I don't expect it to score 5-star in safety, 3-Star would be likely IMO. Engine : A 1L turbo petrol would have a high compression ratio, but longevity can be well managed if the run-in period & timely oil change is given due care to ensure the engine & piston rings are well bed in. The turbo-band seems to be very wide. Going by the driving reviews, it turbo seems to spool from a low 1000RPM and goes up to 3000+RPM, and that is a very very good thing as it'd help drivability (ie the car will feel peppy/nimble) & prevent the engine from being a fuel hog. Mileage : Although the ARAI figures say 20kmpl (MT) / 18kmpl (AT), IMO real world figures could likely be ~14kmpl (MT / AT, both) within medium city traffic. Autobox : It is well known that small turbo-petrols often give poor mileage, especially with automatics of the DCT & TC type, and that CVTs are really good at the very same aspect whilst costing fairly low to manufacture as well as implement into their vehicles. Hence, mating a CVT without tiptronic mode, to a small sized turbocharged Petrol engine is a clever strategy. With Nissan possibly aiming for 30-40,000 units of just the Automatic in a year, CVT was the obvious choice. Nissans' CVTs are made by their subsidiary, Jatco. Although Jatco CVTs weren't known to be reliable until a decade ago, they've since been improving the metallurgy of its components & CVT drive belt. Until I last came across reviews, they were known to only be reliable up to ~1.2-1.5L kms before requiring maintenance/complete rebuild of the GB. So, no matter what their manual may say, it'd be wise of people who buy the Nissan CVT to check if they should change the AT fluid after 90k kms itself, and every 70k kms thereafter. Of course, Toyotas' ultra reliable CVTs are made by their subsidiary AISIN and don't require such care, but they too got it right after spending years perfecting it. In case of ideal usage by the average consumer in India, I don't think a small petrol car would be used more than 1L kms over 4-5 years before it is sold-off. I just believe people shouldn't expect great resale for the CVT variants as many owners would've eventually reported their CVT issues. Price : Nissan is often known to try a sticker-shock price in many countries to gain market share. It is most welcome especially when we find Kia/Hyundai selling similar cars (Sonet/Venue) for about 25% higher price, viz a lot of premium. Kia/Any DCT is not cheap to own either, as their dry-clutches eventually DO wear out and cost pretty high in parts as well as take a lot of expert labour to replace. Looking at some YouTube ""reviewers""/salesmen, competition seem pretty unsettled as India is a price sensitive market. Interesting times ahead.

This one seems to tick a majority of boxes in an informed buyer's checklist apart from safety (although it's too early to say). It will be a worthy contender if Nissan can price the top-end CVT in Tata Nexon XMA territory (~8.5 lakh ex-showroom). Anything more than that and no buyer would be willing to settle for a ""livable"" product. Most cars in this segment offer one or the other USP and are already successful in the market.

50, dudevarkey , 21:54 ,BHPian," Quote: Originally Posted by Godzilla .... he also compares it with e-spresso and Ignis? IMHO this is pure agmark BS. True, a few comments in the OD review are actually to confuse people who are looking forward to buy this. Like ""sub-4 metre (pseudo) SUVs do not have to worry as Magnite will not be a competition for them"". ""People who would otherwise upgrade to a premium hatchback or compact sedan from cars like S-Presso will consider this"". The most damaging comment according to me was ""This is more like a Datsun, not a Nissan"" (as we have a Datsun GO in our family), even though the statement is sort of correct. I am planning to buy an automatic vehicle which is not an AMT, which is not a sedan/hatchback within a budget of 12.5 L. A crossover/ sub 4 metre SUV is what I am looking for. I tried hard, but failed miserably in making wifey drive the S-cross manual we own now. Now a days she is the one who needs a car and keeping 2 cars is not practical - economically and to park. The first car came to my mind was S-Cross Auto, since the one I currently drive is a S-Cross (1.3 Zeta). S-Cross Delta Auto is the variant which fits within my budget, but Brezza Zxi would me more practical considering the features I get for the money, though it is not as spacious as S-cross (we all are below 5'6"", so we can live with that). Also it's a 4 speed torque converter and it does not look good on paper even though it is not so bad to drive. Then I started looking for other options and I almost finalized on Sonet HTK+ Diesel Auto. Having a diesel auto option was the biggest plus point. The moment I sat on the back seat of Sonet, I dropped the idea of buying it. I know I cannot compare a sub 4 metre vehicle with S-Cross, but it was far behind my expectations. Other things that influenced the decision of rejecting Sonet are lack of features such as Hill Hold Assist, rear windshield wiper, Alloy wheels etc. I never considered Magnite because of its dimensions; but once I was left with no cars to my liking, I considered THE MAGNITE. It actually met all my expectations though I am still not ok with the width, height and weight. It offers all necessary feature like good ground clearance, has rear wiper, Hill assist, keyless entry, alloy wheels to name a few. It does lack some features like Sun roof - which I am sure I am never going to use after initial days of flaunting it, Auto headlamps/wipers - which I am not keen on; but most important thing is the price, if the leaked prices are correct I will have some savings after buying the XV Premium - to feed her. Most of the reviewers mentioned that space is better or at least on par with most of the C-SUVs and from the pictures and videos it looks like having adequate space and thigh support. I have booked Magnite last week, however I am waiting to see the car physically and test drive it before taking a final decision. Also need to sell my darling S-Cross which is actually a difficult decision. ", 23rd November 2020,Thrissur/TDPA,150,302,Electric Motor/Battery,Very Positive

118, Reinhard , 11:36 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"I'm not yet convinced that this pricing will make the Magnite a winner Nissan wants it to be. Maybe I'm wrong. Here's why I feel so -While the base pricing of the 1.0NA is certainly very aggressive - as of now, I don't think this version will sell a lot. A 1.0NA engine has quite a few shortcomings for a car of this size in the real world. Looking at the sales numbers of the Triber - its evident that people know it. People will go for a 1.0NA in basic hatchback territory more - considering the established brands have good service network etc - which Nissan does not have. In fact I'm sure the sales teams would also be trained to upsell the turbo & delivery timelines for NA engine will be artificially slow. Won't be surprised if multiple NA trim variants get discontinued within 1-2 quarters of 2021. The real USP of this car will be the 1.0 Turbo & the CVT. The difference in pricing with a Brezza varies in the range of around 35K INR to as much as 1 Lakh INR in some variants at max. Will people be swayed by this difference to pick a totally unknown Magnite with minimal service network? Or they'll take a larger EMI and go for the far more established Sonet-Brezza-Nexon? Especially since the reviewers are also saying that the cabin fit-finish-feel isn't exactly very premium and robust but more utilitarian with an economy feel.

I always bet on the underdogs in fact . My point is - thats not how our market works. Look at the top sellers for last 20 years and you'll get my point. And its not necessary that the 1.0 Turbo engine is better because it is turbo charged. All engines in this segment are rather potent & the Maruti 1.5 certainly is one of the better ones overall. The interiors while good on feature list - have been regularly pointed out to be with economy grade / imperfect material & fixture. Longevity is questioned by most reviewers (even the neutral ones).

Consistently their cars have had more features and more value for money. Always undercutting the competition. Did it help them? Never. Tata is enjoying their highest sales numbers when in fact their cars are costlier than competition in almost all segments. Not undercutting Maruti much. We have an interesting dynamic of customer approach. People don't get swayed by pricing alone. 1 Lakh INR is somewhere around INR 3000 in EMI terms.

154, RSR , 14:22 ,Senior - BHPian,"Nissan have simply hit it out of the park with the pricing! Half-a-million to less-than-a-million rupees ex-showroom! This is just what the doctor ordered for the revival of Nissan India from what seemed to be its deathbed. We already had a few proclaiming that Nissan are ready to pack their bags and leave India (like Chevrolet & Fiat). Rakesh Srivastava's simple response to them is, ""Nissan are in India for the long run, as you will find out soon!"" All three powertrain options are likely to be hits. The quick review mentions that the addition of a turbo has completely transformed the lackluster 1.0 NA engine. And the CVT has been mated brilliantly to the 1.0 turbo-petrol! 100 PS is quite good for a car that weighs 1000 - 1039 kg. The 122 PS of EcoSport, 120 PS of Sonet/Venue & Nexon, 110 PS of XUV300 and 105 PS of Vitara Brezza/Urban Cruiser may be higher, but all those cars are also heavier by a fair margin. With 100 metric horses from its turbo-petrol, the Magnite is also more powerful than the 90 PS WR-V! It's the 72 PS naturally aspirated variant that starts at a kerb weight of 939 kg. Contrary to others' belief, I see good sales for this powertrain as well. Remember, with this powertrain, Nissan are selling a 4 m compact SUV for the price of a micro-SUV like the Ignis, KUV100 & Freestyle! Even in terms of performance, the 72 PS 3-pot 1.0 NA Magnite is likely to be quite similar to the 83 PS 3-pot 1.2 NA KUV100. So, I'm not complaining. In fact, it's micro-SUVs like Ignis, KUV100 & Freestyle that are going to lose the most sales to Magnite (& its Renault cousin, Kiger). Why settle for a micro-SUV when one can get a stylish, bigger 4 m compact SUV like the Magnite (& soon Kiger) for the same price???

Only Baleno pros are a wider service network, UV cut windows, and better ARAI FE. I think people sitting on the sidelines to buy a new car in this price segment should just book this. Most likely they would get a 2021 model as well with the introductory price if there is decent rush/success. The Magnite is not creating a new segment but will eat into the sales of premium /mid-sized hatches, compact sedans. Magnite does not have the most powerful turbo engine, not the fast DCT technology, neither the best rugged Ecosport build, nor 6 speed manual, not as much market reach like Maruti, Hyundai; nor class leading interiors etc; but the product is simply the best value without much to complain. Everything about it is at the accpetable+ levels which is its USB. Nissan's success is not important for just the company but also for the consumers. India loves products that are value and not products that are cheap and this product has the ingredients to demonstrate that and make the consumer market more value focussed.", 2nd December 2020,mumbai,2232,720,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

It is like Lexus selling Toyota cars with Lexus logo slapped on it. This is nothing but brand suicide. That out of the way, lets discuss the pricing. Like all brands, base variants are created only create a price shockers. Not even 10% sales will come from that. In marketing, we call this ladder pricing - means you show an affordable starting price, then lure customers by implying, ""by paying 50,000 more you get these many features. Do you not want those features?"" In Magnite's case, the price difference is a good lakh. Good luck with that. So ₹4.99lac is only to draw people to the showrooms. Now, lets discount the base variant (XE) and lets discuss what XL, XV, XV Premium variants offer at this price? It offers loads of features for sure. None of the other brand products in this segment offer these many features anything close to this price. Variant to variant - 4-6 lakhs difference is there. Having said that, this platform is inferior to any other competitor car's platforms. Tata Nexon's and Mahindra XUV300's 5* safety rated platforms are way superior. But in an era, where novice buyers look for only bling features that they can flaunt with their peers, relatives, neighbours - it is not a mistake that Nissan opted this strategy. Nissan still has to tread with caution. Renault Triber was supposed to be a disruptor - in reality, it couldn't hurt the sales of Ertiga much. Kwid, even though successful, couldn't come close to touch the King - Alto. So they failed to be a ""disruptor"". Often foreign manufacturers make this mistake of thinking you throw anything cheap at Indian consumers, they will stand in a line to grab it. Nano is big lesson to Tata. It is not that Indian consumers are not price conscious, but they will not compromise premium-ness for the price. Nissan instead of losing their brand values by launching a low-end car with Nissan brand on it, it could've used this money to strengthen the dealer network and brought in truly premium Nissan cars.

Datsun platform disguised as Nissan 2. Nissan's prospects in India are quite shaky 3. Nissan has nothing to lose, if Magnite fails, they will pack their bags - Magnite's buyers will be left high and dry.

Yeah true, it is obviously to lure customers into the showrooms because thats exactly what Nissan needs now, for customers to find their way to the long forgotten Nissan dealerships and actually see what are they selling for 4.99? Frankly I went to the dealership for the same reason. I wanted to see in flesh how they pulled it off an entire lineup between 5 and 10 lakhs with a base variant that you don't need to hang your head in shame or look like a taxi if you settle for it, and a proper CVT at the top end.Their shock worked for me. And at least they were up front about it. Not some vague introductory pricing tag which leaves you guessing till when the next price jump will strike. Here it is clear these prices are valid till Dec 31st. And then they will increase exactly by 50k for base variant after that date.(and proportionally for higher variants perhaps). I can't point to any other manufacturer who has been upfront about their pricing strategy on launch itself. Ive only seen silent price hikes at the turn of the year, and a fake price increase before a new facelift launch to show that the new variant is coming at a 'lower' price. And guess what, these base variant shoppers won't need to pay 1lac extra to get the next liveable variant, the base variant of the Magnite has just enough for someone shopping for a 5 lac car and would love some extra space and size to go with it. I'll stick my neck out and say that the Magnite's base variant is by far the BEST kitted base variant of our times.

If someone's comfortable to stretch further and go for the Nexon, they should. But what if you can't? Then the magnite deserves a shot. I'm not in any way supporting the Magnite as the perfect solution to all our worlds woes or neither am I saying its a true godsent which we blindly buy. It has its compromises and obviously so, because heck its a lot of car for 5-10 lakhs. Things I don't like or have concerns about. - Only 2 airbags even in top variant. - Datsun/Nissan regardless, I would love to see GNCAP stars (as I would love to see the Sonets' and the Venues') - Engine gearbox is nothing to smile about for us car-aware/enthusiasts. - Company still doesn't know. They don't seem to know what to expect if its a blockbuster or what to do if it tanks.This shows in the dealers who have not seen crowds in a long time and this I fear shouldn't extend to service. What Im saying is that the Magnite is an honest attempt after a very very long time considering options available to us Indians. Go to the showroom and test drive it. If you don't like it, no problem walk away and buy a superior car. But at least give it that chance. We both need it.

Datsun cars are low cost brand which cuts lot of corners (At the cost of structural integrity). Magnite very much has Datsun DNA and not Nissan DNA. Datsun is not Lexus category, Datsun is an entity from Nissan to have affordable cars for the masses of India. Even after the introduction of Xtrail, it was clear to NMIPL that profitability requires mass reach, in which MSIL is enjoying with 0 stars all day long. So Datsun is cheap because it should be a cheap car to buy. And yes, Magnite was supposed to launch on Datsun brand which all of us presumed by looking at its front fascia but isn't it too early to presume the DNA where it comes from? Datsun comes under Nissan, not the opposite. So let's wait for some test results like GNCAP to make a decision on the quality of the product. Seltos is the best example when people assumed the quality of the car by the looks. Quote: Originally Posted by manjunathkl So ₹4.99lac is only to draw people to the showrooms.

Renault Triber was supposed to be a disruptor - in reality, it couldn't hurt the sales of Ertiga much. Kwid, even though successful, couldn't come close to touch the King - Alto. So they failed to be a ""disruptor"". When all other Indian/Foreign OEMs failed to touch the A-segment, Renault did it with their Kwid. Kwid was a success for Renault, it did reach to some masses and similar case with Triber too, never compare the sales numbers with MSIL, as an affordable MPV it sells on adequate numbers. Quote: Originally Posted by manjunathkl Nissan instead of losing their brand values by launching a low-end car with Nissan brand on it, it could've used this money to strengthen the dealer network and brought in truly premium Nissan cars. But like everyone Nissan wants to make a quick buck. Reason is probably, Nissan global is not in a good financial health. Brand value? like you said, when the company is not doing good in profitability what else they should do? They need to make money. Maybe you are new automotive market, but considering the past of NMIPL, investing in their dealer network and introduce a Rogue or Altima, do people will buy it? NO. Market analysis is the trend of a particular product which could bring in profitability to the company, not a Brand value.

CMF is not a Datsun specific platform, it is used by the entire alliance (Renault & Nissan) internationally, their latest offering, NISSAN Ariya uses CMF-EV platform, does that car look cheap and like a Datsun product? And yes, if Magnite fails, Nissan will pack their bags, but they could've done after what happened with Kicks.

None of the truly Renault cars succeeded because brand characters are messed up. See a global Renault cars and India's Renault branded cars. Today no body knows what Renault stands for. Renault failed to ""Captur"" the imagination of its market. In a globalised world, the novice buyers trusts a brand name - meaning, a belief that a brand carries its characteristics that it stands-by everywhere. They will end-up feeling cheated when they discover that's not the case.

I can't point to any other manufacturer who has been upfront about their pricing strategy on launch itself. Ive only seen silent price hikes at the turn of the year, and a fake price increase before a new facelift launch to show that the new variant is coming at a 'lower' price.

So I will reserve making sweeping statements like 'inferior to any other competitor' till I see results. I think we are confusing safety rating as everything here. Safety rating is one (very important) factor - the platform engineering, sophistication is a different part. I feel 4* Polo is better engineered than 4* Brezza. Yes, a greatly engineered platform might aid in better safety rating - but not necessarily always. As I said you can frame your opinions and not rely on mine.

This is the market that demanded small TVs for centre consoles and small peep holes for sunroofs and those makers who heard them out, has raked in the moolah. Nissan needs to hear them out if it has to survive. Wont blame Nissan. They did bring the X-trail and other great cars to our shores and we treated them how? No one is blaming them for adding bling features, I'm just wondering what the (transparent) Nissan has compromised in order to provide the bling features at that price.

That is the reason it cannot give any price shockers like Nissan. Plus, Mahindra is a considerably more recognised brand in India than SsangYong. I will give you full marks for getting the spelling of ""Ssangyong"" right, though with the exception of y being a capital Y.

So inorder to get crowds back to dealerships they have to play the cost game.

I think the other car makers (especially Koreans)margins are so high because they are well established in the market or they have a managed to create a brand image where people would simply buy a Hyundai/Maruti. In India, Nissan is at a do or die situation. I feel they have cut their margins a bit to establish themselves in India. They would increase cost once they are better established say in 2-3 years depending on how successful they are. This happens with every other business. I also think they are not that cheap. If you compare Nexon. Tata is only around 75 K expensive for a similar specced model. For that 75 k you will get a slightly better engine by 10 ps, 10 Nm, a 6th gear, slightly wider car, 70 kg additional weight. Magnite has some better features like adjustable rear headrests but how much do you think it is going to cost for manufacturers to include an adjustable head rest at the rear (Hardly 1k). Nissan has done a clever thing, they made all these simple, not that expensive (for manufacturing) features standard or available at lower variants (16 inch wheels, rear wiper, 60:40 split, rear head rest, rear centre arm rest, all power windows). Also Nissan offering CVT is the USP compared to Tata Nexon. If you look close enough you will understand Nissan has priced it correctly. It is not low, and I also don’t think the quality is low compared to other cars in the market.

It won't be a deal breaker for most buyers. But it would be a great to know how this Jap fares against the Koreans. - only 2 Airbags on top end variant . Wouldn't have mattered last year.

Agreed . Unless the bootspace of XUV300 is a deal breaker. Magnite has some very good competition in its segment. Coming back to the Magnite, with people flocking Nissan Showrooms to check out the Magnite (with some people coming to Nissan showrooms for first time), this is a very good opportunity for the dealers to also showcase the 1.3 Turbo Petrol Kicks and convince them to at least take a test drive to check out its performance.

There are shockingly ignorant people who are stupid enough to dismiss side & curtain airbags as ""bling"" and ""gizmos"", but just laugh heartily at their sheer ignorance and ignore them completely.

This is the biggest complaint that owners will have. 36 PSI is Nissan's recommended tyre pressure. I dropped it to 32 - while that improved matters, the ride was still too firm & too basic. Second downside are the budget interiors. They are strictly ""okay"" in terms of quality. Attachment 2090235 Thank you, that is very revealing.

316, RSR , 03:05 ,Senior - BHPian,"So the stiff ride quality and budget interiors are the two main downsides of the Magnite. I can live with the okay-ish quality of the budget interiors, but the stiff ride quality is a downer. It's a pity as the Triber has pretty good ride quality. The Magnite is shod with 195/60 R16 tyres. I wonder if changing them to 205/65 R15 (upsizing the tyre width but downsizing the wheel size) would help in improving the ride quality?

321, ashvek3141 , 22:15 ,BHPian,"Had a look at the New Nissan Magnite today & here are my quick impressions. First up, didn't click any pics as there are enough of them in almost all colors all over the net. Let's get two important things first. - LOOKS. The car looks great! This is surely one of the best looking sub-compact SUV's in the market right now. You see the car from any angle and it will surely impresses you. However, the tires could have been a size bigger as the gap between the fenders is a bit too much. Nissan could have gone with the market standard of 215/60/R16 size. Would have surely helped things. Nonetheless, the car still is a looker. - SPACE. This car packs in a lot of space. I am 6 feet tall and set the front seat to my driving position (which is a bit laid back) and I was able to COMFORTABLY sit in the rear with a good amount of legroom to spare. This car does impress you with the amount of space it offers. Kudos to Nissan for such excellent packaging. With this kinda of room in the passenger area, the boot doesn't feel too left behind either. I found it just a tad smaller than the Sonet. But I think this should suffice 80-90 % of the customer requirements. Damn, even that glovebox is huge! - Now, the elephant in the room - BUILD QUALITY. As highlighted by fellow BHPians, the interior quality is budget-grade. Having said that, no way does it feel 'cheap'. I would infact say that it is in-line with the plastic quality that is being offered in the recent Maruti cars, especially the Swift. There are hard-touch plastics at majority of the places, but like I said, none of them feel cheap as such. For one, I felt that the fabric on the doorpads is indeed nice to touch. The door too had a decent amount of weight to it along with a good 'thud' on closure. The bonnet too weighted quite well. The panels didn't feel light or flimsy to say, but yeah they do flex at certain areas with a slight push. - Engine noise is akin to 3-cylinder turbo-charged petrol motor and so are the vibrations. But, don't expect the finesse of the Koreans here; they are nowhere near to them. - Seating position is nice and you do get a feeling of sitting in a raised hatch. I too had enough headroom to spare, both in the front as well as the rear. The driving position is good enough and you get a good view of the road ahead. - The seat are entirely fabric with leatherette accents on the sides. The seats offer good support and have decent bolstering too. I felt the thickness is in-line with those offered in Honda's, which isn't a bad thing. - The Music system sounded decent and these were without the JBL speakers. I don't know how good they will be; but the speakers in stock form do a good job. Rear camera quality is average though. - The touchscreen however, lags behind the current trend. It is nowhere in comparison to the silky smooth touchscreens seen in recent Korean competitors. This one's more in line with my 2015 Creta, albeit multicolored. - I quite liked the MID in the Magnite. Some might find it too cartoonish, but I found it nice in person. The animations are seamless too. - I got a chance to check the headlights of the car and I must say they're pretty powerful which is reminiscent of LED's. However, real world performance is yet to be heard of. Good thing is that, the Headlights, DRL's and the Fogs are all white light, unlike the once seen in other vehicles wherein the fogs are generally warm and look a bit out of place. - Test drives to commence from 18th Dec 2020. - There was only one car available in silver shade. I was keen to seen the white and the 'new' red shade. SA mentioned that their expecting them along with the Demo vehicle. - Introductory prices applicable for bookings until 31st Dec 2020. Booking amount is 11k; fully refundable. - Deliveries to commence from Jan 2020. No accurate dates yet. Waiting period unknown too. Overall, quite impressed with this car and what Nissan is able to pull-off given the price at which it is offered. Can't wait to test drive the car given the fact that the reviews are quite positive especially for the CVT variant. I truly hope that this proves to be a comeback car for Nissan India!

As an owner of Renault Triber since the last 1 year, I can assuredly say that when this car can haul 7 people and luggage in the hills, it's surely not going to be very slow in a 5 seater vehicle (read base model of Magnite which has the same engine with the same specifications as in the Triber).

I have owned a Rapid with same mill under the hood and drove for 6+ years with 1.2lac kms it was sold for under 3 lacs. Well, my car has run over 177,000 Kms till date and is still going strong. In fact, given my high run, i as already at 135,000 kms around 6-7 years of ownership and then the running dropped a bit else might have touched 200,000 till now. Coming to the Vento 1.6 TDI itself, i would have NEVER changed the car if not for this rule of 10 years life in Delhi NCR. I am from Mumbai and given that my parents still drive cars on their own, i am thinking of re-registering the car from Delhi to Mumbai and use it there for another 5 years. in any case, will not be able to keep car in Delhi NCR after March 2022. The resale value of VW/ SKoda cars is anyways low and it is something that i was aware when i purchased the car in 2012 too, but that STONKING 1.6 TDI was enough for me to go nuts over this car and it has served well till date running on everything stock except HU (changed to 330G plus around 3 years back) and 2 tyres change. It is extremely difficult to find a replacement for such a car, and given my budget has not increased much since i purchased the Vento, i am still looking in the range of 10-12 lacs OTR whatever best i can get. In this case, I find Magnite as a good value proposition. Some people might think that as a downgrade coming from Vento 1.6 TDI, but there seems to be no other good value proposition in Diesel in 10-12 lacs range.

Kudos to Nissan for providing all these even on the base variant! As for performance of the 72 PS non-turbo engine, just read/watch reviews of the Renault Triber.

368, Godzilla , 23:35 ,BHPian,"Today had a chance to test drive the Nissan Magnite. Thanks to Mr. Vivek and team who lead the Nissan owners group called Lord of the roads. A small group of Nissan Kicks owners made a visit to the factory, had an opportunity to look at how cars are manufactured at the Renault Nissan Factory in Tamilnadu near Chennai. It was a good visit. I will talk about about it later in my Kicks ownership thread. First things first, This car is a ravishing beauty. I first laid my eyes on the Flare garnet red, OMG, this shade has to be seen in person to appreciate. I later heard from the factory that this is a special paint process and is expensive to make compared to other shades. Hats off to designers, I actually dislike some of the latest designs by Nissan such as the Z prototype and the Aria. However Magnite is Magnetic. The sleek headlamps, wide grill, muscular curves on the shoulder line, perfect rear and proportions make it look stellar. We had a chance to look at almost all shades of the car in the factory. I personally felt Red, White, Black are the best. We also saw the Kiger It did look good but IMO Magnite wins in the looks department. Kiger is almost felt like a bigger Kwid. IMO people might shy away from Kiger as it can be easily mistaken for Kwid when viewed from a distance. Now on to the test drive. It was a short one in the Nissan factory test drive track. I took the NA manual first. It didnt excite me much. The test track was near perfect so there is nothing to comment on ride quality. The brakes were okay, the shifts were notchy. The car did feel heftier than a hatchback in the way it moved. Next was the Turbo Manual, the engine was powerful, smoother for a 3 cylinder albeit not creamy. Again the gearbox is not for the ones who have sporty intentions. This is clearly a family car. Braking was sufficient, the body roll was acceptable, nothing surprising. Sadly I didnt get an opportunity to drive the CVT due to our schedule and all the visitors had to shuffle among 3 cars to test drive. Please note that these impressions are from a very limited drive time and place and I am told that these are not even the final version of the cars. So I would update again after a longer test drive when I get my hands on one. After these sessions I felt Magnite is a winner. It looks fantastic and the space it offers inside is unbelievable. About the interior quality I feel it is equal to Maruthi or slightly better in some areas. After the test drive we were given a presentation on Magnite and was given opportunity to ask questions. When asked about crash testing they told us that Magnite complies with global crash standards for frontal, side and rear collision. However I really wish for a test result just to be sure. To summarise, if you prefer premium feeling interiors but is ok with less space inside and willing to pay more then go for Koreans. If you want 5 star safety rating then go for Nexon. If you want the maximum space, VFM and features and but not worried about sporty driving and is more comfort oriented then go for Nissan Magnite.", 12th December 2020,Chennai,260,1901,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

The sales person was quite courteous, well informed & eager to assist despite there being a good amount of people moving in and out at the showroom. People are interested largely because of the price. Test Drives will start on 15th December and customers who've booked will get priority. This is good because they're basically assisting customers who've already bought into it to assess the car thoroughly. Dealers have been instructed not to charge anything for cancellation. Coming to the car, will lay down a few things I felt : STRICTLY 4 seater. 5th passenger will surely be a tight squeeze unless all 3 sitting behind are kids. Rear arm rest is a tad narrow but, ok. Driver ergonomics seem good. Visibility seemed good. Navigator gets a large sized glovebox. Rear AC vent will be much appreciated. Despite the small cabin space, the interior optimisation is well planned & thoughtfully laid out for keeping water bottles, phones, file folders etc. For the segment, fit and finish is very good. Magnite has a 3 year extended warranty package available. The 5 year AMC package priced at 17k makes it very good value as that comes to just 3.5K per annum, viz the same as what Tata charges for my AMT Nano! Strongly suggest the Extended Warranty & AMC. Also, I'll repeat, if you're buying their CVT then do change (without ""flushing"") the automatic transmission fluid after ~70k kms even if the manual allows for a longer duration. Huge boon that the Engine bay is well laid out with plenty of room for mechanics to work. Waiting Periods : Base variant : 2 months Higher manual variants : 1 month CVT variants : 6 weeks Any variant in Red Colour : 2 months Dealers are probably earning only from Insurance and ""Basic Accessories"". But they've been instructed to focus on building costumer confidence so they won't push back much. Also, there are many dealers in metro cities. Price protection for bookings made in December. Base variant will see a steep 10% rise and others will be at least ~6%. Strategy : Nissan needed market traction & attention, hence the aggressive pricing strategy. The buzz this has created among buyers of the largest type of car sold in India - hatchbacks - is largely because of the price & the company is probably going to make the car more profitable after the initial buzz. My cousin owns a Sonet and I'd surely agree that Sonets' design has better road presence & interior quality has its unique premium look, the Magnite has slightly less road presence with budget (but good enough) interiors. All this car needs to do is to just exist especially so that Kia/Hyundai come back to senses with pricing as well as variant distribution.", 13th December 2020,Bangalore,1418,3490,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

With a sub-4 meter SUV with a top petrol spec touch 15 Lakhs is really steep. Even though I want to buy it but 15L is beyond my pocket. Moreover I think Nissan fits so well into my pocket. 10.5L for a top spec seems very aggressive. But my only concern is Nissan's ability to capitalize on this situation. Hence I still want to go for Nissan. Though I also test drove SCross Zeta which is very close to Magnite and it is available for 12L on road Faridabad. So currently I'm very confused.

First thing, S-Cross is not a sub 4 metre car. It's front seats are bigger, it has lot of space in rear, and more boot space also. But it lacks on some features like 360° camera, wireless android auto/ Apple car play. Overall I would vote for S-Cross but the 4 speed torque converter is the only barrier. Also there is chances that Maruti would discontinue it. Positives for Magnite XV Premium CVT - it offers all features available in S-Cross Zeta Auto except all 4 disc brakes and costs almost 2L less. The rear seat comfort (mainly thigh support) is almost par with S-Cross despite being the smallest subcompact SUV/crossover in the market and offers better ground clearance too. If the car is going to be used mostly in city, then Magnite is the best option; otherwise S-Cross (if you are ok to live with the 4 Speed Torque converter).

It's another matter if you have decided not to buy another motor vehicle but is there any comparative car which comes at Magnite's price? They are practically giving it away for free. Magnite is 2 to 3 lakhs cheaper from various rivals and yet has more features. I'm not a Nissan fanboy, nor am I trying to sell you a Magnite but what you mentioned as reason not to buy can be worked on. Escalate to Nissan. Every car dealer of every brand tries to fleece you and extract extra money under some fancy sounding head. Nissan dealers are no exception. If I were you, and if every attempt made by me fails, I wouldn't lose a great car just for the sake of Rs.8,000/-, when the next rival is rupees 2 to 3 lakhs away. That is peanuts in a ten lakh rupee car. Before anyone jumps at me for saying this, I am in no way endorsing dealer's demand. But this is harsh reality of Indian automotive scene and every dealer of every brand tries to fleece as much as he can get away with. This is why people walk into dealership with a reference from some known contact. Lastly, at least you walked away because of 8K demand.

True, I would have followed up with Nissan and waited a couple of days more. I haven't discussed about insurance and price breakup with the dealer yet, will do it post test drive and after making final decision. However if I am buying the car, I'll fight to get handling charges (if they ask for) waived off. I would still purchase the car even if they are not waiving it off. As you rightly said, the competitors are way too costly and considering them to save Rs. 8000 would not be a wise decision. We can mail a complaint to the manufacturer and if there is no response, escalate it. Mail IDs of higher officials could be found by a little research on internet. If there is still no response from manufacturer, we always have option to make a complaint to transport department (after purchase). There is strict instructions issued by transport department restricting the dealers from levying any additional charges like handling charges and a complaint with solid proof could result in hefty fines to cancellation of trade license of the dealer. From my experience, if you take a stern stand the dealers would surely give up. Maruti had tried selling me their insurance and told me that they would not deliver the vehicle if I did not take Maruti Insurance. A one line mail to Maruti made everything right.

396, ChevyTeddy , 12:11 ,BHPian,"Just dropped by the showroom as soon as they opened this morning to check out the Magnite in person, and my first impression was that the photos don't do it justice. (Won't stop me from adding two shots to this quick review ) Apparently, the XE (base) variants now have a waiting period of 24 weeks. All other variants have a waiting period of 6-8 weeks on average. And yes, they are still prioritizing test drives for those who've already booked the car, so the pitch was ""if you wait for a test drive before booking, the price (post Dec 2020) will increase."" However, I confirmed that the booking amount shields you against the 50K+ price increase even though deliveries will happen only in 2021. I'm guessing this is because Nissan wants to get a good idea of the demand for the next couple of quarters. Smart, because the booking amount will be refunded in full if the test drive is unsatisfactory. Dealers being who they are, I'm still quite wary of this ""fast, full refund"" promise. Speaking of dealers, I was shown the XV and given a full walkaround of the features. There's a significant sense of road presence. The side form factor reminds me of the Creta, especially with the pulled-back hatch, but the front has a modern look that sets this apart. The salesperson was quite well-informed (but, to be honest, I didn't grill her on many of the technical specifications because I didn't have a lot of questions anyway - I'd have preferred a test drive over any and all verbal assertions of ride quality and engine performance). Someone has remarked earlier on this thread that the rear bench is comfy for two passengers, and would be a tight fit for three passengers. While I did find it roomy enough, I found the middle seat's back - which houses the armrest, cupholders and mobile holder - to be quite stiff. On a bad rut at a fair clip, anyone who's resting their back on this armrest is probably going to get a free straightening of the spine whether they want to or not.

The car engine stalled when I switched it on while parked on an incline, disengaged the handbrake and then put it in drive while the car just kept rolling back - lack of torque at low RPMs. TPMS is a basic OK / Not OK and doesn't show the actual tyre pressure. The audio system ( I drove the standard / non JBL version ) is pretty good. Wonder how much better the JBL would be. Wireless android auto didn't work. Sales guy had no idea how to enable it. I am sure it works just that he didn't know how to. A few more things I noticed - The trip meter was showing the car had been driven for a total of 90kms and the avg. efficiency was 5.2kmpl.

Almost like my 2015 Swift. 2. Doors are light, so is the tailgate. On the whole, dont expect solid build. Those having Terrano in their garage and looking forward to Magnite as secondary car will be disappointed. 3. Dashboard is high. One the move after adjusting the seat to a higher position one can see the hood, but the high dash somehow creates a claustrophobic ambience for who are not tall. 4. Ride quality is surprisingly mature in urban surroundings. Helps to increase comfort quotient. 5. CVT is well tuned for light inputs. In typical urban domain if one is not looking foward to lunge in to those small gaps, Magnite is happy. However, demand more and it disappoints. There was some sort of incremented lag at around 2200 rpm. Gearbox wont let the car accelerate, had to flex right foot to get gearbox out of what I feel is transmission flat spot. Worst part of CVt is gathering speed quickly after speed breakers. Due to suspension killing design of speed breakers, I was tackling them at 10 kmph. But gathering pace after speed breaker was not effortless and demanded quite heavy throttle inputs to quickly gather pace. 6. Engine has vibration at idle as expected from a three cylinder. As rpm needle climbs, so does the engine noise inside cabin. 7. OVRM Electric motors retract or open ORVM quickly ! Definitely faster than what I had in my Swift. Power windows roll up and down quite fast, faster than my 2014 City. Overall : Good for around Rs. 8 lakh, but not more than that. For a small footprint, they have created quite a well proportioned silhouette. Excellent effort but somehow, I didnt feel its as well rounded as it could have been specially when top trims touch a million bucks.", 26th December 2020,Vadodara,4981,2925,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
453, tj123 , 23:41 ,Senior - BHPian,"I was looking for an automatic car with small foot print and higher ground clearance due to the pathetic condition of roads around me. When I saw Magnite I liked sharp design and couple with a good CVT and a value for money price tag. I went to a Nissan Showroom on Christmas day, the dealership was buzzing with potential customers. I was lucky to get a test drive of the XV Premium CVT variant within 15 minutes. On starting the engine, I felt a very mild vibration while at idle, which is typical of a 3 cylinder engine. Putting the vehicle on reverse I experienced the around view monitor, felt it was pretty useful feature to have while parking. Although the quality of display could have been better. The test drive was short may be around 1.5 -2 km. The service road on the outer ring road was all dug-up and shabbily covered with rocks and dirt, good way to test the off-roading capability of the Magnite. Well it handled it quite well there was no noise or thuds. Maybe I was driving it sanely The CVT was very smooth and responsive overall I liked the way it handled the bad roads. While driving there is no noise or vibrations in the cabin, overall I will rate it as 'good' considering the price point. The interiors space was decent and the rear space was far better than Sonet. The sales man who accompanied me was not that experienced and was struggling with his English. Anyways looking into the price list, on the point of insurance they said that I am free to take it from outside they dont have objection, but if I go through the dealer endorsed insurance claims can be processed cashless. Looking at the price list they have not mentioned the handling charges fee upfront but smartly they are asking a Rs.8000 fee for RTO registration expenses (as highlighted in the pricelist). If one does not want this then customer can opt out and get it registered themselves is what they are telling. Since there were too many people around and I was running short on time, I did not bargain much and just paid the booking amount of 11k and came out. In the forum I read somewhere that handling fee is not being charged now, is there a Nissan contact point where I can escalate such malpractices by dealers, can anyone enlighten me ! I booked the dual tone red shade which is having one of the highest waiting period (approx. 4 month) anyways I am in no hurry to get the vehicle right now.", 26th December 2020,BLR,1146,676,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Neo Nissan Noida employed similar tactics when I asked for a breakup of the RTO charges mentioned in the pricing sheet. I was told that I am free to get the registration done on my own and if I don't agree with their pricing then the booking will be cancelled and my amount refunded completely ( Already paid INR 5.5 lacs ).

462, dudevarkey , 09:58 ,BHPian,"Did test drive of CVT on Sunday evening. It drives better than what I expected after watching all those reviews in YouTube. Had taken it on bad roads, highway and on steep incline and it was ok on all roads. I have read somewhere that the hill hold works on inclines of 20 degrees or less, but it was not the case. The stock speakers (not JBL) was better than what I had in my S-Cross. The around view monitor display was very bad when I checked it in the display car inside the showroom, but it was far better in daylight; still its low resolution. I am ok with the car and so planning to go ahead with the purchase. A few observations (not sure if these were specific to the TD car as the car had some technical glitches when it arrived at the dealership). Power windows work only when the engine is running. The fuel gauge turns red when fuel tank is about to drain, not blinking like some other cars. The car stalled during the drive and the fuel gauge was still showing one bar and the distance to empty (think so, not sure though as there was only a symbol, nothing written) on the MID showed 21.7 Km.

469, Turbokick , 13:09 ,BHPian,"Finally I took the test drive of both MT and CVT variants of Magnite. I have booked the CVT XL variant prior to this to keep the price locked (as promised by Nissan). Here are my observations : +ves : 1. Stunning looks. Very balanced and most proportionate 4 meter CSUV in its class. It may not be as tall or wide as some of its competitors but it makes up with a great design overall. 2. Space management is pretty sorted. Front seat space is good. Rear seat has got adequate knee room and headroom. The width wont allow three people to seat comfortably though. A kid can fit in. Floor is flat for better comfort. Boot space is again reasonable and wont be thing to complain about. 3. 1.0 Turbo has got meat. It is pretty responsive and can give you brisk acceleration with four people on board. Midrange is strong and that matters a lot. 4. CVT is smooth in terms of power delivery. The acceleration is very linear and thanks to the torque on offer, the rubber band effect is not prominent. Just like the Manual version the CVT can be a brisk performer as well. 5. The ride felt sorted. I think the car can handle bad roads with decent authority. It is not a smooth and sophisticated setup to keep the outside noise away but the body feels reasonably solid on bad roads. High speed stability should be good well. 6. LED headlamp setup looked good in the dusk. Spread should be nice and thick. -ves : 1. Vibrations ! The 3 cylinder thrum is considerable. CVT in particular felt very noisy at idle and at slow speeds. The whine of CVT transmission makes it not so impressive. MT is little better in this regard and more acceptable. I wonder how the car will age with time. Hopefully the noise and vibes don't increase over time. Don't expect 4 cylinder Honda/Hyundai kind of silence. Diesel lovers would feel at home though 2. The clutch in the MT is heavy. It is heavier than the Dzire DDIS which I own. Very aggressive while releasing and it can be little annoying in the traffic. 3. 360 Degree Camera has got embarrassingly poor resolution. Instead of such gimmicky they can simply have a single back camera with good resolution. 4. Steering calibration isnt perfect. It has got unnecessary weight at low speeds and the feedback isnt very direct. Neutral points : 1. Interior doesnt look too cheap or bad. It is pretty reasonable. Doors feel adequate and not Maruti light while closing. There are some fit and finish issues but not terribly bad anywhere. 2. Digital console looks funky and the display quality is good. It takes some getting used to though. The Tachometer reading is little difficult to understand while driving. 3. Infotainment system is fine. Not great not bad or laggy as some competitors either. 4. The 6 speaker non JBL system sounds fine. Nothing much to complain here. Nissan Magnite. Its stance when compared with Creta and Kicks. Dashboard layout. Neat ! The speedo console and good looking steering wheel improve the ambience. Poor quality of 360 Degree camera. ACC Controls and Switches. Boot space is adequate. All the textures used in the cabin is visible here. Door panels have gap. Though it is uniform. Door Lock/Unlock hinges are well made unlike what some reviews had to say. Front doors. Gear lever has got slightly long throws. Glovebox alignment looked fine. Depth is nice. Some misfit parts. Rear doors. The Denim like materials on door pad would last well. Will be easy to clean too. Rubber beadings look bad here. Steering is well made. Wheel cladding is bit too big but would protect the panels well.

474, ChevyTeddy , 13:19 ,BHPian,"Managed to get a test-drive of the Magnite Turbo XV Premium (Manual) yesterday by being the first at the showroom (Marikkar Nissan in Trivandrum). My impressions: 1. Really easy ingress/egress 2. Clutch is not very forgiving - stalled a couple of times while I was trying to find the sweet spot for change-engage-move. But it's also easy to get the hang of, especially when you are on the move, and then shifting gears was very smooth. 3. No vibrations when stationary or moving at low speeds. Having been tempted to consider a change of wheels only because of the Magnite, I was a bit disappointed when people mentioned that vibrations are significant (read, uncomfortable). I paid special attention to this aspect, but nowhere did I feel that the vibrations were a problem. At idle and with clutch fully engaged, I wasn't even sure the engine was running. Addendum: During one of the stalls, I wasn't aware that the vehicle had stopped. When I restarted the car, I wasn't sure if the engine had come back on - it was that smooth. 4. Suspension isn't one of the reasons to buy the car, though. That said, over-inflated tyres (""as it came from the factory,"" was the SA's response to my query) could be a cause. There was wobbling, but even on a really bad road, there was never a feeling of being thrown around. 5. Power steering is LIGHT. I'm used to the Ritz's strong, solid PS. Magnite's steering feels like the old i10's, but even lighter. For a significantly bigger vehicle, it might take some getting used to. 6. Audio quality on the stock setup is more than passable - it's as good as the setup I have on my Ritz (which was an after-market installation and tuned to my liking) Special note to the staff for not blindly sticking to rules (""test-drives only for those who have booked the car"") and giving me a spin. They were informed but not pushy. And clearly buoyed up by the demand they are seeing. I'm told there are 500+ bookings for the showroom since the launch and wait-times are now 24 weeks+ for the Manual XV Premium, and 32+ weeks for the base XE. TLDR, good test drive.

Looks bold and beautiful. 2. There seems to be lot of space between the grill and the radiator. Gives even more bigger appeal. 3. Fit and finish could have been better. A compromise for the price in my opinion 4. A, B, C Pedals were close and I didn't feel it comfortable reaching to them. Space was less in the foot area. 5. IRVM felt very cheap as if, its picked from a regular fancy store with rough edges. 6. We didn't like the AC vents design. Love/Hate. 7. we could see the car flex everywhere we pressed it.

Few pointers: Stunning Looks - Good proportions, the car looks like it was designed to be a sub 4m car right from the start, not a chop job. Special mention to the XV premium with all LED headlamps, looks very sharp. Space - When you see the car from outside you wouldn't think it will be very spacious, but it is truly a pleasant surprise once you step in. Three of us sat in the back seat and we found it comfortable & spacious. (In terms of back seat, the XUV300 is still top of the class). The boot too has a good shape and capacity. Quality- The interior quality is definitely & noticeably better than the Brezza though not as good as the Koreans. Padded doors, neatly designed dash, everything felt good to touch. Chunky steering wheel is nice to hold. Lambo-esque AC vents look and feel special. Safety & Build - We all are waiting for the NCAP results of the India spec car so no comments on that front. But the doors shut with a good thud. Point to note - doors are not light, neither are they heavy. Same story with the bonnet. Minimal flexing on body panels. So initial impressions are pretty good. Engine & gearbox - Punchy mid range is a joy to drive. Even below the power bracket, it doesn't feel sluggish by any means. Car feels stable and gearshifts are engaging. Go for the turbo variant - highly recommended. Negatives: 1. Vibrations. At idle there are Vibrations on the floor & some felt on the pedals. Once on the move these vibrations disappear. No vibes felt on the gear lever. Could be a deal breaker for some users. 2. Dealer reach - this is self explanatory. For a service interval of 10k kms or 1 year driving far once a year shouldn't deter someone from buying a capable car. Not a deal breaker. Overall it is an impressive package at a reasonable price.

The CVT+Engine combo is very good - Yeah, the CVT makes the car quite noisy during heavy acceleration, but it isn't bad at all - I'd live with that for the smoothness compared to the AMTs in this segment. 2. Eco mode isn't as dull as I expected - There's more than enough grunt available for overtakes and a quick getaway from a stop. 3. Decent stopping power. 4. Looks great! 5. Feels quite spacious; I'm 6'1"", and I could sit behind myself without my knees touching the front seat. I guess that's the best you can expect in this segment anyway, no? 6. 360 Degree camera was perfectly usable and helpful. Dislikes: 1. Exterior body panel flex. 2. ORVMs were vibrating violently whenever I opened or closed the driver/passenger doors. 3. Interior plastic quality is strictly below average, nothing is going to wow you. 4. The TD car had just 500 clicks on the odo and the dashboard had a terrible rattle, this will only get worse with time. For context - I test drove a Nexon Petrol with 13,000km on the clock and it was SOLID. 5. The front armrest is going to be pretty much useless for short people. 6. The ride quality is stiff - Not anywhere near the Nexon's. 7. The creeping speed of the car was slightly higher than I'm be comfortable with. 8. The way the doors close doesn't feel re-assuring. 9. Prices are going up - The base model is going to get dearer by 50k and 30k for the top model. (Ex-showroom) 10. High speed stability felt iffy - I couldn't take it over 90, but even at 90 on a less than perfect road, I felt nervous. Overall, I'd definitely buy this over the tin cans from Maruti, but build quality is vital to me, so I'd probably wait for the Nexon DCT. I can't have my car's dash rattling, it'd drive me crazy. This one's going to be 11.5 on road for the top variant in Mumbai, which isn't THAT much cheaper than the other better built options.

The seats were extremely uncomfortable so was the cabin. It felt extremely claustrophobic inside and like I mentioned before, my head was touching the roof. I also drove this for the first time today and I must say that I agree with you on most fronts. The sales staff did their best, but were unable to clarify the service costs of this car. Didn't like the seats or the cabin very much. This just feels like a spruced up Kwid to me. The Figo that I am using doesn't have the hottest interior either, but I preferred even that to the Magnite's. Another thing is that I felt that the driver's footwell is extremely narrow. I felt that the cabin is also quite narrow. Either both of us are too large for the car or it's the other way around. On the other hand, I would like to meet the genius who decided upon the rear view mirror for this car. Nothing would please me more to introduce him to the classier side of my Malayalam vocabulary to show how much I loved this piece of equipment. Didn't anyone actually drive this car and look into the mirror once before approving this for production? I drove the CVT variant. The test drive vehicle was new and not abused. The transmission was smooth and is better than the lousy AMT-s that manufacturers are peddling nowadays. I'm not a huge fan of the engine- it didn't feel like it has 100 horses. Brakes were mushy and needed to be pressed down hard to get it to stop. Steering feel felt typically insulated and light like modern EPS units. The drive was over smooth roads and it wasn't long enough for me to judge the ride quality. This vehicle seems to be built to a cost and to tick spec sheets. Even the interior seems to be filled with gimmicks than any actual thought put into making it. I prefer to have the basics right than screens, wireless charging and 360 degree cameras. I really felt more comfortable in the Figo than this. The only positives the Magnite is having in my books is that it has a higher seating position and a competent automatic (both are things which I do not need). At north of 11 lakhs on-road in Kochi, this gets a hard pass from me. It makes more sense to spend some more and get an automatic Ecosport which feels in a different segment even though it is quite old. No comparison to the XUV300, Venue and Seltos in terms of interiors and overall execution. As for me, I would much rather buy a bhp-ian's pre-worshipped car than buy any car new these days. 11 lakhs used to get you a TC automatic City a decade back (an Innova also used to cost about the same). Am in no mood to pay that much for a tarted up Kwid. End of rant. Off Topic: There seems to be some pretty good discounts for the Kicks. The 1.5 NA model (although manual) isn't that far off (around 12 lakhs and change) from the top end auto variant of the Magnite. 2020 models seem to be discounted as well. Hope this helps prospective buyers.", 9th January 2021,Cochin,168,373,All-Wheel/4-Wheel Drive,Very Positive

550, shibujp , 17:53 ,Senior - BHPian,"I had a chance to checkout the Magnite here in Trivandrum the other day. At first glance I was impressed with the looks of the Magnite. It exuded the traditional SUV high bonnet, bluff face stance. The 16 inch tyres looked big enough and filled the wheel arches enough not to seem puny. Elements of the Nissan Juke and the Qashqai seem to peep through in the design in a good way. Here are my impressions... Exterior, Interiors and Space The quality of trim on the grill, the plastic cladding on the side, all had a premium look and not cheap or well plasticky. The pearl white shade looked expecially nice in contrast with the black trim. The rear looked very nice though from certian angles in the three quarters from behind the it looks like the GO+. Switching to the interiors, I was expecially impressed with the design of the center console. The location of the start stop button is especially cool to me. I also like the shelf created under the plastic beam on which the button is mounted. The switches for the volume, HVAC etc look very nice and standout as well, with their unique toggle like design approach. The AC vents are designed so to keep the cold air from being directed to your face as per the Service Advisor who was attending to me. The digital dashboard display on the speedo leave a lot more to be desired. The current display resolution simply looks like software built on a budget. Instances like this is where you realise that the cost cutting has had it's mark. Also the resolution of the rear camera is poor as well. While the top end has 360 degree view I am not sure given the resolution how usueful this would practically be. Nissan while cutting costs has been careful to ensure that the cost cutting is not too evident at first glance and customers do not feel short changed. One aspect of the Magnite is that it feels more spacious than the Venue or the Sonet. Even with the drivers seat adjusted for me, there was ample legroom at the rear. The rear seats too felt comfy and well designed. The boot space is quite good and the 60/40 split is a good feature. Engine Start the engine and what hits you first is the vibration at idle. This is one serious put-off with the Magnite. It rears it's ugly head again once you stop at traffic lights, slow down for bumps etc. I also felt that the creep in first gear without throttle application was not good enough. The usecase being when you slow down to pull into a side road and slowly get off the brake and expect the car to slowly creep forward while you press the throttle. I kept having to blip the throttle to get the car moving in such cases. Power was quite good inspite of the trademark CVT rubberband effect being there. You don't feel down on power at any point and acceleration felt good. It definitely feels more sprightly than the Polo AT and the Sonet AT. Ride and Handling Steering wheel is light but on one instance while taking a u turn, I felt a little inconsistency in the assist, with the steering feeling a bit heavier than I expected it to. It is well weighted during higher speeds too. On regular highways the ride was good and felt stable. However on a undulating B road with occasional ruts and small pot holes the shell felt light though the wheels absorbed the bumps well. Ride quality is quite good and even on rough roads the suspension does it's job silently. Brakes are good with a light dab itself proving quite adequate. . All in all the Magnite impressed me. I was eavluating it to replace my wife's i10 AT so I may be okay with the entry level CVT too that itself is quite well specced. At 10.42L on road in Trivandrum for the top end CVT version it's excellent value for the money you pay. It's not a Sonet or an Venue beater as it just does not match the quality that those cars exude in terms of materials, software and the over-all experience. But then they both cost over 2 lakhs more too. Excellent product from Nissan! ", 13th January 2021,Trivandrum,1735,3119,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

Hi akg7091, Might I suggest you cancel your booking and get back your money. Buying a car has to be a happy experience, IMHO no car is worth this much headache and pain. Moreover if you have not received any response or ownership for your issue from Nissan themselves why should you give them your business ? My friend was having a similar experience until yesterday with the Tata dealership in his hometown for his Altroz diesel that was promised to be delivered to him within 4 weeks of his booking. He got no update from the dealership even after 3 weeks. Post a tweet yesterday to Tatas handle on twitter, he got a call from the regional manager that allots cars to dealers in TN and billed his car immediately. Even though my friend was planning to cancel his booking this response from Tata within a few hours has given him a positive vibe on the whole. But I see this lacking with Nissan from your posts. Maybe you can think of getting the Renault Kiger that is being launched soon. EDIT: Kindly ignore my post. Saw only now that Nissan has already contacted you.

Unlike the other newer cars which mask the speeds, this car tells you that you are driving fast. - Just the overall feel of the car is slightly underwhelming.

Kiger appears to be a well rounded package too. Confused about the pros and cons compared to magnite.

I am surprised that Kiger doesnt offer hill assist control in any variants. So, Magnite is a clear winner on paper. It is 20k to 40K cheaper than Kiger in the equivalent CVT variants, offers more safety, and some useful functional features.

635, united , 16:20 ,Newbie,"Absolutely fed up with the lousy and lethargic sales service from NEO NISSAN. It's been more than a month since I took delivery of my Magnite. The sales staff is not responding to calls anymore and used to constantly call when they needed payments. Even when they do respond, there are no timelines shared for estimated completion of smalls and minor tasks. Complete disregard for a customer's time as one has to keep following up on a daily basis for basic things. I have not been able to enjoy my ownership experience at all due to such trivial matters. The dealership could have resolved them promptly but they end up creating a backlog at their end. I'm sure other customers must be facing similar issues as well. Below are some of the pending issues after more than a month of owning the car - 1) Process of permanent registration was started on Feb 1 but was completed online after repeatedly following up on Feb 11. On Feb 11, I was able to create a digital RC at least for the time being. Since then, the smart card RC status is pending with no clear timelines by the dealership (image below). Processing its approval and dispatch is such a straight forward task but the dealership is slow as usual. As I don't have a smart card RC, I am unable to endorse the registration number to my car insurance, as told by my insurance agent. Good thing I did not take insurance from the dealership. I would have rather preferred to get the car registered on my own had I known NEO NISSAN would be this slow. 2) They have pasted the fastag sticker on my car but the sticker is still not associated to my car or my mobile no. It's been more than a week since I've had the sticker, but it will not work as it's not mapped to my mobile no. or the car. I have been following up but there is no response yet. Why is the dealership charging for the fastag if they don't intend to provide the service! I could have applied for it myself and got it in a couple of days. 3) I paid for +3 years extended warranty and also for 5 years Gold Maintenance Package. I have not received any mail or documents either from the dealership or from Nissan directly as a mail. I am not sure whether Nissan even has email id updated in their system because the dealership is again - slow and lethargic. I would suggest people not to opt for these packages at the time of car purchase, but hold off on getting these packages in the initial 2-3 months. It would cost the same amount of money and will be less of a headache. There are a few other concerns as well though I would want to forget them as they are quite trivial. I am certain this is not the last of it, and the after-sales experience will continue to be likewise at NEO NISSAN. A fantastic car being destroyed because of poor sales experience and mismanaged customer service.

637, ChevyTeddy , 05:07 ,BHPian,"Visited both showrooms and took a test-drive of the Magnite CVT. Will update this comparo after I've had a TD of the Kiger Turbo NA later today. My impressions: * While Kiger seems more photogenic and appealed to me in pictures, it isn't as impressive or imposing on the road as the Magnite. The Mag has a proper SUV-ish feel to it, while the Kiger leaves a not-quite-there-yet feeling. * With rear central armrests being the norm and not the exception, most vehicles we checked out felt like they were four-seaters because no one can sit comfortably in the middle of the rear bench. Kiger and Magnite (which offers non-armrest-ed backseat for its base NA variant) felt comfortable at the back. * The driver's armrest for both vehicles are not as useful as I'd imagined that they would be. * The storage cubbyholes that Renault has packed into the Kiger is amazing! Compared to that, Magnite's storage spaces seem spartan! * That said, it felt as if the Magnite's 336L boot was bigger than the Kiger's 405L one. Quite possibly, the Magnite's boot is a tad deeper than the Kiger's (which is wider), which creates this illusion. * The doors - especially the rear ones - seem to open wider on the Kiger than on the Magnite. But thanks to its taller cabin, ingress and egress on the Magnite is not any more difficult. Six of one, or half a dozen of the other, I'd say. * The fabric finish on Magnite's higher-ends beats the Kiger's plasticky doors. * The overall finish of the interiors felt better on the Magnite (despite it seeming more spartan) than on the Kiger. Kiger's solid plastic surfaces look like they will crack in a spot or two in the next 10 years. * Despite being taller on paper, Kiger feels like it has a shorter cabin than the Magnite. With the latter, I could climb in without a problem; Kiger required a slight lowering of the head. * The handbrake positioning on both vehicles is sub-optimal. Kiger places it right next to the passenger seat where someone could pull on it by mistake while reaching for the seatbelt lock. Magnite's handbrake lever is in its traditional spot next to the driver, but its stalk covers the gear notations on the CVT. Makes it tricky for first-time CVT drivers. * The digital displays on the Kiger do seem cleaner and more 'mature', while Magnite's display and animations feel cartoonish. Functionally, no difference though. Price-wise, I'd say the two are rather evenly matched - what one misses, the other has, and vice versa. But if you look at what gives you the core elements you need for driving comfortably (TPMS, Hill-start Assist, CVT vs AMT) at a particular price point, the Magnite edges out the Kiger.", 17th February 2021,Bengaluru,88,276,Drivetrain,Very Positive

Finally, the dealer I went to had the XL CVT on display. Not sure why they removed what should essentially be a simple button to activate a function on the ECM but that finally convinced me to consider the XV CVT. Had a few questions and would appreciate anyone who can clear them off:Does anyone know how much is the cancellation charge that Nissan is quoting? With such a long waiting period I rather not loose a chunk of change for cancellation if something better comes along. Is the extended warranty provided by Nissan itself? Or is it the infamous myTVS extended warranty that Renault provides on the Duster? Are there any decent tires that I can upgrade to? Continental UC6 or something equivalent. The suspension while being OK had a slightly stiff edge to it and I was hoping to negate that with better tires with a higher sidewall height. Quote: Originally Posted by nma83 Which dealer was this?

The non Turbo version didnt feel under powered (it was as short TD with only 2 people) in city driving with moderate traffic and in sport there was some perceivable change but not too much. Immediately went to the Nissan Showroom while the Kiger experience was fresh to compare. Except the Spartan interiors Magnite appears to still be a better value for proposition to me especially for the XV Turbo trim that I have booked.

688, ashka83 , 17:03 ,Newbie,"First post in Team-BHP! Off the bat, a big Thanks to the admins for approving my membership request. I have been following the portal for a little while only. Basically, its a one stop shop for all automotive stuff and what not for amateurs like me. The expert reviews, opinions, knowledge sharing, etc. truly make this an unique place to be in for anyone interested in cars. Coming to my story with the All New Nissan Magnite, I booked the beauty on Dec 10th, 2020 as soon as it was released. This is the XV Premium Turbo MT dual tone option(Blue with white roof). However, test drive was possible only 10 days later due to delays in TC registration of the vehicle, etc. Everyone in the family loved the design, space and features. For me also, it was a no-brainer Now comes the fun part. Even when I booked the vehicle on Dec 10th directly from the dealer, I was promised vehicle would be delivered asap(No firm dates or timelines). Being a new vehicle and due to increased bookings at the local dealer(Marikkar Trivandrum, Kerala) who told they got around 600 bookings at their place alone in one week, I decided to wait. The Dealer did confirm to be my January Mid that I will be allocated my vehicle In Feb 2021(give or take 2 weeks). But the booking form had no firm date. Funnily enough and being so naive at this point as to trust the words of the Dealer, I decided to sell off my old car(Renault Pulse RXZ Diesel 2012) as I live at my wife's place and my dad-in-law has a VW Vento in case I need to use in case of any emergency. Came to know from other sources that the actual order with the company was placed only on Dec 19th(So a delay of 9 days from the original booking done from my end.) After that begins the daily calls with Sales executive, escalation to AGM, Escalation to CRM, etc and all the hubris. Even after all this and as the date of writing this(Feb 28th), there is still no firm date from the Dealer. Nissan is also involved but I am not at all positive about any concrete help from them. My first car during my first job in Abu Dhabi, UAE was the Nissan Tiida. It was a fantastic car and I loved everything about it. Turned a Nissan fan for life. Based on these positive vibes, I decided to go ahead with the Magnite, even though it was a new product and Nissan India would have kicked the bucket if this turned out to be a failure. I am having second thoughts in my mind about the Magnite now. Its a beautiful car with all the modern gizmos and features, but having no positive update about the allocation is making me very very uneasy. Ooo..that new Altroz Turbo petrol in Harbor blue does look delicious and tempting. On another note, when all this was happening, I had a chance to do a TD of the new Renault Kiger RXZ trim. Below are some of the cons I felt on the Kiger when compared to the Magnite. These are my observations and may or may not differ from the others in the forum: 1. The Kiger feels a tad bit bigger when compared to the Magnite from the driver's seat. I am talking about the handling perspective. Magnite feels a lot more compact even though based on the same platform. 2. I felt the interior plastic quality was not as good as the ones on the Magnite. Especially, the top RXZ trim is all hard plastic including on the inner driver side handle rest area. The Magnite has a fabric finish in the XV Premium option. 3. The top trims of the RXZ comes with 4 airbags and ABS+EBD as standard. However this pales in comparison to what the Magnite offers: ABS+EBD, HSA, Traction Control, Vehicle Stability Control,TPMS and more. The cherry on the cake is the 5 star rating from ASEAN NCAP. 4. This is purely a personal choice, But I love the design of the Magnite over the Kiger anyday. So there is my story in a nutshell..Once again a big Thanks to the admins, mods, reviewers, SME and all the members for making this site the best.

Prices of the XL Turbo and XL Turbo CVT variants have been hiked by Rs. 30,000. The Magnite is available with two engine options. These include a 1.0-litre, 3-cylinder, naturally aspirated petrol engine that puts out 71 BHP and 96 Nm and a 1.0-litre, 3-cylinder turbo petrol unit that makes 99 BHP and 160 Nm. Both engines are offered with a 5-speed manual transmission. The crossover is also be offered with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) mated to the 1.0-litre turbo petrol engine.

Add to it the fact that Kiger production started well in advance of the launch, and you pretty much have a production capacity of (I'm guessing) 3 to 5k Magnites a month. Given that the Magnite registered nearly 30k bookings in December itself (and a month's production limit in just the first week), it's no wonder even December bookings are yet to be delivered in March. With shortages in semiconductor and steel, I'm not sure the plant can scale up production beyond a point even if they wanted to. So for clearing 40k bookings, it will take Nissan the better part of a year - no matter what the CEO says. On a different note, Renault played it smart with the Kiger. They waited to see the demand for the Magnite, tested the waters and then started producing cars way before the launch so that they can pull some of the traffic from Nissan with shorter delivery schedules.

I've very clearly mentioned in my emails to them the car that I booked online is 'Nissan Kicks'. They still wrote to me welcoming me to the Nissan Magnite Family. Moreover, the dealer in Mumbai has had communication with me. And they've said that they'll make the refund on or before 25 March 2021. I'm really really scared of buying a car from this French-Jap alliance. Their dealership experience is a nightmare in itself. The Renault dealer in Mumbai gave me the following update: Sir your car will be allotted in a couple of weeks. Because your purchase is outright, please keep the funds ready. Because there is shortage of cars, we can give you 3 days after allotment date to make the payment. The car will take 7 days minimum to reach here from the plant. After which PDI can happen. Me: I would like to do PDI of the car before any payment. Dealer: in that case sir, you're one of the few people who have also argued for handling charges, and asking for PDI etc. We sell so many cars. Only very few ask for PDI. So I'll give you this middle solution. Make half payment of 3 to 4 lacs, when car is allotted, and balance after PDI to your satisfaction. I was stunned. Quote: Originally Posted by BobbypinsGuy Hi guys. My update to get my refund after my experience with Mumbai dealer is still status quo. The Mumbai dealer is a joke. Please stay away from this product unless Nissan doesn't open a competing dealership. I assure you, the level of customer service will be completely different. Guys let's understand their 'business'. They're solitary dealers in Mumbai. We have to be crazy to think, they'll offer us good customer service, if we are standing in a queue outside their showrooms with our money to buy their cars. They're too regressive to realise that tipping points move very quickly when a customer is spending a million rupees. It's not a 15000 rupee phone. The sales rep calls me, asks for more details. I provide them. She hangs up. I just don't understand how to solve this for all of us. I feel like actually writing to Rakesh Shrivastava ji. I saw his interview with some auto YouTube channels.

I am considering getting a Magnite or Renault Triber or Kiger for my mother. She and her sister go for city runs (shopping/visiting relatives etc. ) and have had a used Punto for the last 5 years. They are always chauffer-driven through the ""dial-a-driver"" service - so driving excitement or effort does not matter in this decision. They are increasingly finding it hard to get into the Punto, since the seating is low and leg room is very limited. Theya re reasonably tall ladies and find it much more comfortable to get into small/mid-size SUVs as well as MPVs. The first option that sprung to mind to replace the Punto is a used Ertiga, but 5 year old Ertigas are selling for almost 7 lakhs in Chennai Then the thought of getting a Triber or a Magnite/Kiger came up. These cars are very attractively priced for the base variants and these have basic safety features covered. The Kiger even has a 4-star crash test rating! Plus they seem spacious and relatively reliable. The higher seating position should help my mom and aunt to get in and out more easily. For less than the price of a 5 year old Ertiga, they could get a brand new car, which should hopefully run trouble-free for many years to come. Views from current owners much appreciated!

And I did tell him that Nissan's future in India is a bit iffy, even though the Magnite has transformed the company's fortunes here... Any thoughts from our members here? Having looked at nearly every vehicle in the 5-13L range, I am pretty certain about this: if you look only at the vehicle and what it offers (and forget whose it is), each of the Magnite trims is VFM. As someone who bought the barebones Ritz LXi for 5L OTR in 2011, if I simply wanted a like-for-like replacement, the base-variant of Magnite isn't too bad a choice. I might pay 1.5L more in 2021, but I am getting a BS6 engine, decent interiors (for the price point) and a brand new vehicle. If I were looking for an SUVish automatic, the CVT trims are excellent VFMs too. Their competitions are all priced above them for the same set of features. If you look at build quality, with the Seltos (and by guilt of association if nothing else, the Sonet) now looking like a poster-child tin can , the Magnite seems to be decently safe . All that aside, however, your point about Nissan's long-term commitment to their sales future in the country is definitely worth being worried about. A poor sales network cannot stand up to the service networks of Tata, Maruti and Mahindra that dot most highways or major urban centers. They've averaged just about 3.5K units per month, which, given the hype the Magnite commanded, is too low to keep their dealers excited. My SA told me they are expecting no CVT deliveries at all this month - for a Bengaluru dealer in a prime location - and while I do think he was just fobbing me off, a delay of 6+ months is enough to drive most people to other models. I can already hear the SA's oh-great-another-delayed-delivery sigh in his voice. Magnite has neither the cult following of Thar nor the guarantee of Ford to keep its customers waiting interminably. What if Nissan pulls the plug and does a Fiat/Chevrolet? I suspect Renault will pick up the pieces. Cosmetics aside, the vehicles are the same under the hood, and the plant in Chennai is unlikely to shut shop (unless there is serious Union trouble), so spares won't be an issue. There is no downside there as far as I can see. TLDR: Magnite is a great vehicle with an excellent value proposition, and the dependence on the branded network is not insurmountably high.

Steering return issue: some of the reviewers on Youtube had complained of the steering not returning to zero position after a turn. I tested this on multiple turns and there was no such issue. Perhaps it is due to the linear acceleration of the CVT - there is enough time for the steering column to straighten out on its own. 2. The ride quality is not smooth. With the suspension on the stiffer side, there is no body roll - but you will also always know what the terrain under you is like. Between the NVH and the vibration from the ride, it reduces the plush feeling the cabin creates.

94, digitalnerd , 19:10 ,Newbie,"I was initially looking at upgrading from my 2013 eon to a tiago top variant. The only things missing in the tiago from my perspective, were larger tyres and higher ground clearance since I have to drive through water-logged areas in Mumbai. So, when the magnite and kiger launched a sub-segment of their own, I took a test drive of both. In my opinion the magnite variants are more value for money and I got all the essential safety gear on the magnite XV turbo MT. I booked the car on 19th July from Etco Nissan in Navi Mumbai. The sales executive was firm that no discounts can be offered and that the logistic charges (6500 Rs) are from Nissan itself and I am free to contact them. On the insurance front, when I told him that the quote is twice the amount from policybazaar he said he will try to negotiate on that front before actual delivery. I only received a congratulatory mail from Nissan India on 22nd July but it did not contain any reference number. Moreover, the TrackMyCar link on Nissans website showed that my number is not registered with them. My sales executive asked me to wait for 1-2 weeks for the records to update. I finally wrote a mail to Nissan customer care yesterday airing my concerns about waiving logistic charges and issues in TrackMyCar tracking. I got a callback today from their customer care department. As regards my concern on TrackMyCar issues, the executive told me that they update the records monthly once on the 15th. Since I booked it on 19th, the records would only reflect after 15th August. Im surprised that with all the digitization that has happened, they are only updating/refreshing the status once a month. I will wait and watch in this regard. The executive then tells me that logistic charges are local charges that dealer levies and incurs. That I need to co-ordinate with the dealer alone to have them waived. I asked him to put it in writing and Im quoting his reply that I received via email: Quote: As per our telephonic conversation regarding your concern related to logistics charges for the purchase of All New Nissan Magnite, we would like to inform you that logistics charges are local charges that the dealer would incur for helping a smooth delivery to you. These will include fuel in the car at the time of delivery, transit insurance risk and other associated costs towards delivery of the car. Also, we request you to get in touch with your dealer if you would like more details on the charges and if you need them to waive the charges. Ive seen in the thread that a couple of tbhpians were able to get the charges waived by writing to Nissan.

While the car was nice and quite value for money but when we checked it out in person, we found one very weird but genuine issue in it. The rear doors that open in 3 steps are really hard and difficult to open for senior citizens. We checked multiple Magnites and all of them had the same issue. Sales person said since Nissan cars are solidly built and are safer than competitors, they are bound to have heavier doors. Due to this aspect alone, the car was rejected despite being an excellent offering otherwise. The difference was especially visible since just 5 minutes ago we checked out TATA Punch that had easy opening 90 degrees doors.

148, kolrahul , 19:00 ,Newbie,"Hello Friends this is my first post in Team-BHP and I could not think of a better occasion than sharing my buying & initial ownership experience of a brand new Nissan Magnite Turbo CVT. I have owned the car for 2.5 months now and, before going into the details, here is a quick list of my likes and dislikes about the car: Likes:Good Turbo engine and smooth CVT gearbox with no noticeable lag High ground clearance Excellent safety features (Brake Assist, TCS, ESP, Hill Start Assist) even for lower (Turbo) variants Good range of features, considering the price range Great legroom and decent-sized cabin Good looks & great on-road presence Fantastic price range DislikesNo auto-unlock system for the doors; old manual pull-up locking pins Rear seat can be cramped with 3 well-built adults Driver armrest is too short, to the point of being useless Only 2 airbags Rear antenna height non-adjustable Buying Decision: We are a family of 4 and owned a 2012 Honda Brio (SMT model), which had mostly been used for city travel with the very occasional highway trip and had served its purpose perfectly. In December 2021, the Brio was still going good (~ 65000 Km), but as the 10-year anniversary was coming near, I was looking for a new car (Petrol) to replace/upgrade and I fixed a budget of approx. 10 Lakh on-road. My main requirements were: Automatic Transmission (I have recently had pains in my left leg when operating the clutch in office-time traffic) Good for both city and highway travel (I intend to use it for longer trips this time) Safety Decent mileage Spacious and efficient Good on-road presence I was not keen on a hatchback (personal preference) and my first thought was to go for a Compact Sedan. But going through different forums and reviews I saw that there was nothing new in this segment  all the manufacturers were focusing on CSUVs (based on current popular trends I guess). So I started looking at Compact/Mini SUVs as well. Based on initial research, I made the below shortlist: 1. Honda Amaze VX CVT 2. MS Vitara Brezza VXi AT 3. Tata Punch Creative AMT 4. Tata Nexon XMA (S) 5. Hyundai Venue SX 1.0 Turbo iMT Honda Amaze VX CVT I test drove the Amaze first, considering that Compact Sedans were my first choice and out of some degree of loyalty to Honda. This ticked several boxes  the most budget-friendly of the lot, a decent smooth CVT (with some lag, as can be expected), decent safety features and decent mileage. What went against it was the lack of a Turbo engine and Honda being no longer what it used to be back in 2012 (when I had bought the Brio). Plus, the Amaze has been around for like, forever MS Vitara Brezza VXi AT Despite the fantastic chain of dealership and servicing options and a (surprisingly) good safety rating, I decided against the Brezza. Reasons : Lack of Turbo engine and antiquated 4-speed AT gearbox. Also, no Brake Assist or ESP (though these are admittedly rare in cars of a 10Lakh budget in our country). Tata Punch Creative The newest car on the block and it did pack a punch. 5-star safety rating, good looks and good mileage. In my budget, I could go for the top variant, which meant I would be getting all the available features. Cons: 3 cylinder non-Turbo engine, possibly jerky AMT gearbox, especially considering regular city travel, less rear-seat space. And once again, missing out on BA/ESP and even the Hill Start Assist. Tata Nexon XMA(S) A fantastic car. It had almost everything I wanted, including the advanced safety features. The major cons I could find were the doubtful performance of AMT gearbox and lack of rear wiper/defogger/fog lights. Also being a low-end variant due to budget limitations, some other nice-to-have features were missing, for example, no LED headlamps, no parking assist, no 1-touch driver window (even my Brio has that one ☹) Seriously, I dont know why the Sunroof is provided, but no rear wiper/defogger. I was expecting this from MS/Hyundai, but not from Tata. Our manufacturers and customers both really need to re-assess their priorities Hyundai Venue SX 1.0 Turbo iMT I was really interested about the new iMT gearbox. Went through all the reviews in Team-BHP forums and then went to the nearest dealership for a test drive. And I quite liked it. It gave me my comfort of manual gearbox, but without the clutch  so my left leg could rest easy. I liked the car as well  good looks, good Turbo engine, nice interior space and packed with lot of features. Cons : The safety aspect was seriously lacking. It did not have a crash rating and also, all the safety features (Rear wipers, Hill Start Assist, Electronic Stability, Traction Control) were present only on the top variant (which was way beyond my budget). Once again, comfort features are prioritized over safety Additionally, the dealership experience was not that good. They kept pushing the i20 N-Line, even when I told them I was not looking for hatchbacks. Nissan Magnite While I was analyzing / test-driving the above cars, a friend suggested the Nissan Magnite. I had not considered this earlier mainly due to the lack of dealerships / service centers. At my friends suggestion, I looked at the Magnite in more detail and what I saw, really surprised me in a good way Excellent looks, good Turbo engine and CVT gearbox, all the safety features as well as convenience features, decent interior space and right within my budget  on paper, it looked too good to be true. I went through the detailed review on Team-BHP (excellent as always) and also the videos available on YouTube and decided it really was worth a test-drive. Luckily, there is a Nissan dealership nearby in my city. I visited the dealership and the salesperson was polite and courteous. He explained the features available in the different variants and arranged for the test drive. As I drove around in the Turbo CVT car, I really loved it. The Turbo engine was good with excellent power, CVT was butter-smooth with no noticeable lag, the suspension was pretty good and the creep function would be a boon in office-time traffic. The salesperson was fine with me driving around the city as per my route choice for nearly 10 Km (compared to Hyundai & Honda, where they pretty much dictated the route  not more than 1/2 Km at most). I later took a second test drive on the Magnite a couple of days later (this time with my family) on a different route, again ~10Km  once again, not even a frown from the salesperson. Final Decision: By this time, I had pretty much decided to go for the Magnite. I really liked that they offered all the safety features even on the lowest Turbo variant. Within my budget I could easily take the XV model and with a slight bit of stretch, could go the for XV Premium as well (added features of LED headlamps, TPMS, 360 degree camera, Rear AC vents and Cruise Control). What remained to be checked was service experience and the wait-times. Going through Team-BHP forums once again, I found BHPian swiftvxi06s post (Story of White Beauty | My Nissan Magnite Turbo XL | Ownership Review). It's a fantastic detailed review and learning about his positive experience with Nissans service center filled me with confidence (all the more since he is from the same city). Another relative who currently owns a Nissan Terrano also told me about his decent experience with Nissans service  so I was all set on this front. Regarding the wait-times, the salesperson told me it would take at least 2-3 months. However, he did have a topmost variant car (XV Premium (O)  with added Telematics) readily available. I was a bit apprehensive about this obvious push-sales technique but it did have some benefits  the car was in my preferred colour (Sandstone Brown), it costs only ~10K extra beyond my original choice of the XV Premium variant and I would (hopefully) get it before the new year. I went ahead and booked the car. The salesperson readily shared the VIN number. With help from the Team-BHP article, I verified that the car was manufactured in November 2021. I asked for a stockyard PDI and went there the next day  the car looked good (if a little dirty) with very few Km on the odometer. I confirmed my purchase with the dealer after a bit of haggling on the insurance (they did not fully match the Policy Bazaar price, but did reduce the price to a near figure) and went through all the documentation. Registration and some other processes took another 2/3 days and I finally took delivery of the car on Wednesday 29th December. Ownership Experience: I am currently working from home and as such, have not been able to drive much in the city in full traffic conditions. The car mostly stays in the garage on the weekdays, with only trips to friends/relatives on the weekends. However, we did do a couple of long drives (both around 500km round trip) and got a feel of highway travel in the Magnite. In all, we have clocked a total of 1300+ Km on the car in these 2.5 months. The overall driving experience so far has been, in a word, fantastic ! The car has totally lived up to my expectations. The driving position in the Magnite (with seat height adjustment) allows a commanding view of the road. Upgrading from my Brio, it is a considerable difference. Ergonomics is good  all the necessary controls are on the steering or easily reachable from the drivers seat. Lack of auto-unlock is a pain though  the doors are not unlocked even when the car is set to Parking gear or even the engine turned off. You need to manually unlock, either from the central panel, or the old-age door pins. The HRA0 1.0 Turbo petrol engine gives great performance with a nice pull and good strong power surge, especially on open road. The CVT gearbox is butter-smooth and I never noticed any lag in the low/mid range, unless suddenly trying to accelerate to pass another vehicle. Hill Start Assist is a boon as there are a couple of flyovers near my home where I sometimes get stuck on the incline due to traffic signals. The car has good stability at high speeds and never felt wobbly on the highway. Regarding build quality, the Magnite feels solid. I had some apprehensions that the lower price may have resulted in a weaker build quality, but really no such worry here. The recently released 4-star GNCAP ratings seems well-earned. The ground clearance is awesome and the car absorbs potholes and small bumpers easily. Interior space in the car is awesome with excellent leg room and adequate thigh support in both front and back seats. The rear seat though is best suited for 2 adults and a child or 3 adults on the slimmer side. It will feel cramped with 3 well-built adults. Internal storage space is good and boot space is quite adequate (although less on paper than its competitors). Two pain areas  the driver armrest (only available in the XV Premium and XV Premium (O) variants) is short to the point of being useless for me (I am 54 in height). And I have found that I am unable to reach the Fuel tank open level from drivers seat without opening the door. Not sure if any other Magnite drivers have faced that problem, but I feel it could have been designed better. In February, I also had my first experience with the Nissan Service Center as the car had its first inspection at 2 months. Their service representative who handled the inspection was extremely courteous and explained all the details of what they would/would not do. He did try to sell me an anti-rust coating though, which I refused (I guess thats just their standard operating procedure). In all, a decent experience. To summarize, the Magnite is a genuine Value for Money. Considering that it undercuts most of its competitors from the price point, you can get all the necessary safety features and commonly used comfort features, with added good looks, good space and a smooth driving experience. Nissan has done a good job with this car. I would highly recommend the Magnite to anyone looking for a Compact SUV.", 13th March 2022,Kolkata,3,44,"Engine, Fuel System and Exhaust",Very Positive

159, Styler , 11:57 ,BHPian,"Dear Nissan Magnite Owners, I have always owned big cars in my life. Starting with Contessa Classic when I was 24, to Cielo, to Scorpio, to Toyota Camry followed by Grand Vitara 2.0 and Grand Vitara 2.4. Being in Delhi I had to sell my Toyota Camry and Grand Vitara 2.0 as both these are completing 15 years in the end of 2022. Now I have only the Grand Vitara 2.4L Manual 2012 left with me. I wanted to buy a second car, primarily for my wife and daughter to drive. They insist that they need a smaller car, and preferably an automatic, they just can't handle a big car like the Camry which we owned till now. Being 6 ft tall and used to big cards, I narrowed down on the Tata Nexon and Nissan Magnite Automatic. My wife and daughter could drive it regularly and I could also drive it occasionally. I just came across a 2021 Nissan Magnite XV CVT TURBO Petrol Automatic 2021 12K Kms done. The seller is asking for 9.5 for this.

I'm not a Magnite owner but for a 1 lakh rupee difference, wouldn't it be better to buy a brand new Magnite in the color and variant of your family's preference? Additionally, you can bargain for free accessories and discounts as well.

163, swageo , 19:54 ,BANNED,"Finally, after some confusion, deliberation, confusion, I went ahead and booked XV CVT. Expecting delivery in a month. I started my search for 7 seater, and Crysta was the obvious choice. But since new Crysta is coming early next year, I thought I will wait for it. Didn't consider xuv700 and safari due to multiple reasons Since I started search and I also need a small car, I moved ahead and evaluated multiple cars, before finalizing Magnite. Requirements: CSUV, AT, Petrol, good safety features, - Nexon was my first choice, but felt its AMT is too primitive. I assume Punch AMT will also be like this - TD S Cross, though it's not CSUV. Felt bit underpowered. - TD New Baleno. AMT felt much much better than Nexon. Drive is satisfactory even though it's not turbo. Interior is also excellent. But bit skeptical about build quality.. Also, it's seating is like sedan, not of SUV. Am impressed with customer handling by Next showroom. - Altroz DCA is bit underpowered, based on reviews, and don't have ESP. Also DCA is new here and worried about initial hiccups - Kiger don't have ESP, and seems hill hold is also missing. How? So latched on to Magnite, even though it's interiors are bit ordinary , my 13 yrs old Civic is better than it. Also do have some apprehension about Nissan's fate in India, but hope Kiger would survive . Over the phone, dealer sounded mute, but found dealable when I visited the showroom. What I liked about it: Turbo, CVT, Looks, 4 star crash rating, ESP, Hill hold, Space utilization, Build, security features, VFM factors, high stance, useful boot, 2nd row can fit 3 medium adults. What I didn't like: Not much color options, useless armrest, average plastic dash. Mod Note : Please avoid typing with excessive dots.........like................this.

The interiors are much better in Magnite and I didnt like the exterior looks of Kiger (though subjective). What put me off more was the push for immediate booking being close to april end.

Its a 2013 Skoda Rapid 1.6 Tdi - the top spec elegance of those times. What an amazing car it has been - excellent pick up, great mileage and a beautiful experience with Skoda ASS. It has been inexpensive to maintain - I have driven 85000 kms and it never even asked for a clutch repalcement. Now the problem is that 7 months are left in its life. I am currently looking out for a CSUV - mandatorily automatic - has to be a safe car with good build and good efficiency - Already have an MG hector DCT top Sharp( Top Spec) and everyone in family loves that way the car is. I have my eyes set on Magnite CVT turbo and happened to recently test drive one. The SA came in for a home test drive. The car was disgustingly dirty from inside and the moment I sat on the wheel i saw a TPMS warning. I asked him what is that for - he was casual about it. Just around the corner of my society - there is a tyre guy and he identified a puncture. I was amazed at how careless the SA was about this fact. After this, the TD went fuss free but I face two issues, want some of the owners to also confirm. 1) The AC of the TD vehicle was not effective - Infact i neveer felt that it was able to even cool the cabin - it kept tripping on and off whenever I moved from a stand still 2) There was excessive idle vibration in the car - I have never seen so much vibration in any other car - so much so that the front passenger seat was also vibrating along with the car vibration when it was left empty. I asked the SA about these issues - and told him that if he wants this booking - he has to take the car back, fix these issues and bring back to me with why these occured and I will give him a booking What are the owners experiences with the above two points Also, a deep stress on the fuel economy please, with a guzzler (read MG hector) already in my Garage - I am looking for something that gives good fuel economy.

Thanks in advance folks I have a magnite which is still new and ran only 1k kms. My experience with Nissan both sales and service were found to be very professional. I do have exp with almost all brands and can surely tell Nissan is amongst the top few. My car also had a steering mounted switch control issue and it was promptly replaced without any hassles. You might have had an issue with a specific lathergic SA or dealer. Pained to hear this. On AC tripping i have had no issues so far. I keep temp set at 26 and may month being the peak heat to test went well specially with the ac outlet at the back in the xv prem. The AC has been quite effective even in stop go type signals of a city On the vibration : yes it is on the higher side i have also observed if the car is still at D drive mode. But i change it to N neutral mode when i see i need to wait for long at traffic signals and then there is no vibration. It is also good practise for a better FE. My engine is yet to complete the initial run in period. So far as per MID i am getting FE 11 to 12 in city and 17+ on highways.

In this thread, some members have reported same noise. But I could not find any particular solution. Is there any way to get rid of the noise? Cleaning break pads/lubrication doesn't work.

Steering is a slow turner too. I guess to address the older gen magnite's steering 'not restoring to centre issue' they meddled with the caster angle a bit resulting in a stiffer Steering ( compared to initial design). Anyhow while taking a quick u turn u still need to roll your arms to speed up the steering return. But as pointed out 'it is something we can live with'. Otherwise a great car.

I got to know only when I asked to see the old one on taking delivery of the car - they had to admit they didn't replace despite telling me it was replaced ! 4 ) Bonnet will be repainted FOC - I have been told that the previous paint job was not as per SOP ( they missed the heat treatment ) and this time it will be painted properly. I hope someone from Nissan India reads this thread. I want Nissan to succeed. I haven't faced any issues with the kicks / redigo we bought. It's only the magnite where the poor quality of parts used is showing up within a year of use. They need to audit the parts supplied by vendors to ensure their specs are being met. Wonderful car - great engine / gearbox / mileage. Poor QC. Apart from a few misses, the dealership employees have been helpful. No complaints except ""forgetting"" about the work to be done for 3 weeks ( ETA 3 days ) ""twice !"" and cleaning the tail lamp when I was told it had been replaced. Hopefully this time they will actually replace the tail lamp !

248, akg7091 , 03:20 ,BHPian,I feel both good and bad that you are not buying a nissan vehicle. I want people to buy Nissan cars so that they don't pack up and leave idiots like me stuck without service. But I don't want anyone else to suffer the sarkari attitude of the dealerships. If you can risk it ( not all dealerships will be the same ) go for the magnite - the engine and gearbox combo is SUPER. We have a manual 2018 baleno and the magnite is a superior car by far. The gearbox is silky smooth. I don't think there's any other car at this price point offering so much value. I just hope Nissan improves. Also keep in mind the Baleno now uses AMT instead of CVT IIRC I have driven the following vehicles priced less than 25 lacs in the past 10 years and can very confidently say the gearbox and engine combo is out of this world. Even my wife who is clueless about cvt / amt / tc etc says the magnite is much easier to drive than other cars in the house. 1 ) Civic hybrid - very smooth but laggy gearbox if the hybrid battery is not charged ( no torque from the electric motors ). This is superior to the magnite with the electric motors but the magnite is much better if only ICE is compared 2 ) Baleno manual - magnite wins hands down in all aspects except servicing 3 ) Verna a/t and manual - magnite is MUCH smoother than the verna a/t. 4 ) XUV 700 - the AISIN gearbox is very quick but you know when it's shifting unlike the CVT in the magnite which is seemless 5 ) City CVT - has more lag than the magnite ( even I find it hard to believe but it's true ! ) Quick update as well : received call at 9:30pm from the dealership team - vehicle has been repaired and will most likely be delivered tomorrow. As a goodwill gesture they repainted minor scratches I had on the rear left door without any charges or such a request being made by me ( no dents - just scratches from an auto that decided to rub AND cut against my car waiting at a red light ), 22nd September 2022,Noida,424,833,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

250, kovilkalai , 22:56 ,BHPian,"I wanted to share my experience of buying a Nissan Magnite. I was one of the unfortunate people in Bangalore who lost their cars to the floods. I had a Honda Jazz and a Tata Hexa (that I absolutely loved) that got flooded. The Jazz is a total loss, while the Hexa is still being evaluated. In any case, I needed a car either as a replacement for the Jazz or as the sole car (depending on what happens to the Hexa). I decided to go for a small automatic under 18L on road. I am 6'3"". So, I needed the car to be spacious. I also wanted a driver's seat that moved back far enough to make me feel comfortable. I also wanted ""value for money"". The vehicles I considered are: 1. VW Taigun/Skoda Kushaq 2. VW Virtus/Skoda Slavia 3. Kia Sonet 4. Tata Punch 5. Nissan Magnite 6. Renault Kiger I test drove the Taigun. It was a good experience. It had decent space for the driver and decent space overall. Drive was balanced. I had shortlisted the Highline 1.0 TSI AT variant (mid-level). I will get back to why I rejected it. I didn't test drive the Virtus/Slavia twins. There wasn't enough headroom up front and it was much worse in the back. I dropped the Kia Sonet for mediocre safety and a long waiting list. It also felt overpriced compared to my final choice, the Magnite. The Tata Punch felt smaller. And it had a waiting list. For a guy who has no car and lives in a part of Bangalore that isn't well served by public transportation and Uber, waiting lists aren't acceptable. That left the Magnite and the Kiger. Even though they are twins, the Magnite felt slightly roomier. And the Magnite had more features for the price. Although the Kiger had more boot space than the Magnite on paper, I couldn't tell the difference. The interior space in the Magnite wasn't too far away from the Taigun. When I test drove the Magnite, I was pleasantly surprised. The 3-cyl buzz, although more than the buzz in the Taigun, didn't bother me as much. Since I used the drive the Jazz earlier, I was used to the CVT and the Nissan version actually felt better. The 1L turbo was peppy and generally refined. The ride and handling was balanced. While it wasn't as good as the Taigun, it wasn't too far off. At the end of the day, I was getting a top-end Magnite for 5 lakhs cheaper OTR than a mid-variant Taigun and that made the decision for me.

He pointed out the same white patches I had noticed and reprimanded the workshop for the paint damage on the fenders / surrounding panels ( in his view this has happened due to using rubbing tools without using masking tape on the fenders ). The bonnet underside was slightly damaged and rusted as pointed out by me - he thinks this happened while the bonnet was removed and painted the last time. 4 ) The door paint will be fixed as well - not being repainted 5 ) Fenders / other panels damaged will be touched up to cover the bare metal and avoid rusting The bonnet / door are NOT being replaced with new panels.

Even the reliable ones like Hyundai/Toyota have so many complains in this forum and other social media platforms. That makes me wonder- is it the electronics and gadgetry to blame? It can't be possible that likes of Nissan have forgot how to make cars? Probably the race to stuff in the car with as much computer possible getting us to this position. Engines in themsleves are reliable but the whole computer control mechanism is probably messing around the working on Machine overall. Paint & Plastic quality are going down because of balance between Cost & Gadgetry. By the time designer start selecting upholstery, paint, plastic they are probably not left with any budget at all..?

How is not actually checking the suspension for 5 months and keeping the car parked at the dealership an electronics issue ? They kept telling me there's nothing wrong with the suspension and they had opened and checked. Suddenly after 4 odd months they finally told me shocker is not working. They had to open the suspension again after replacing the shocker because I refused to take delivery as the noise wasn't gone. This time they found struts and some other parts damaged and replaced on paid basis. Even now 10-20% of the original noise is still there. Five months have passed and car was with the dealer for ~4 months out of 5. Forgetting to order parts multiple times, keeping the car for a month for a job with eta of 2-3 days, not painting properly( according to the Nippon expert who came he had trained the staff on preparing the red paint back in 2021 as this paint is a mix of red and candy white but they didn't prepare the paint properly. In his words ""maal kam hai"" on top part of my bonnet. He also pointed out some other issues with paint that I as a layman hadn't even noticed ). On multiple occassions the dealership even forgot the car is parked with them ! Worst is complete lack of contact by Nissan employees till a few weeks back. I sent a mass email this weekend to every person I could think of by guessing email addresses and that seems to be the reason things are progressing now. If it was a maruti car I am sure things would have been resolved in 2 weeks instead of the ~10 months that have passed since feb when I first reported the suspension noise and HU / DRL / bonnet paint etc. Nissan India is a poor joke being played on unsuspecting and trusting customers", 12th October 2022,Noida,424,833,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

Have you tried replacing the control arms and suspension mount? These are not that expensive parts which might help with getting rid of the noise you are experiencing. I know a little bit about this because recently my creta's front suspension (both struts) were found to be leaking during service and post replacement I'am noticing some rattling and khat khat noise (noise is not that much, lets say intensity and bothersome scale of 10 out of 100), this was not there before the replacement even with leaking struts there were zero issues, so even I'am trying to solve this. Other than that without doubt Nissan has massively failed you and if dealership is offering 8 lakhs, you might be able to get 9-9.5 lakhs from the outside, I suggest you get rid of this once and for all, the amount you'll get is not that bad considering all the extreme frustration it is causing you as is clear from your posts, doesn't seem worth the effort.", 12th October 2022,Gurgaon,505,1355,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

The expert from Nippon told me that the previous paint job was horrible to say the least and listed so many issues with the same that I can't even recall all of them. Something called dft ( paint thickness ) was only 20 while it should be 50-60+. Along with that the paint wasn't mixed as per the process sheet provided by Nippon. The problem was that the painter who was trained by him last year quit few months back and the new guys had no training - they were cleaning the dust off the cars to be painted inside the clean room The suspension noise / wheel alignment will be checked in the next 2 days. Thank you @rocketscience. I have little to no knowledge of suspension components and will pass on this feedback to the dealership to check and replace on paid basis if found faulty ( no point wasting more time over warranty ) I was also told that the email I sent on the weekend to the Nissan top management ( first email in 10 months ! ) has ruffled some feathers even though I have not got any call from anybody at Nissan. Also, the senior leadership at Nissan is now aware of the ongoing feedback / documentation / status updates I am sharing on this thread. Hopefully they will use my experience and feedback to improve processes at the service centers nationwide. PS : If anybody has a red magnite and it needs to be repainted - please ensure you tell the workshop to follow the written process shared by Nippon which has the exact measurements of base, color and candy white to be mixed along with the 10 odd gun parameters and distance / stroke to be used.

The two body shops have paint booths and obviously the colours are standard so it’s easy. I took the opportunity to change the ghastly chrome bits at the base of the bumper and also the faux skid plate colour from the standard yellow/gold to the colour of the body.

Do you mean being lite on the accelerator? Or, getting into high gears quickly? (I am bit of a novice when it comes to auto mobiles) I'm no expert either, but I'll surely share my experience To give you a reference, I started driving practice in a 2014 Innova and man it was a fabulous car with a great diesel engine! So, I was mostly used to diesels. When I started driving the Magnite, the turbocharger with this 1.0L engine took me some time to get used to. So, the turbo here activates around 1800 rpm and it gives a quick acceleration forward. That was something I wasn't used to. At first, I would drive the Magnite just like the Innova: high gears, at least as long as it pulled, because if you've driven a diesel Innova, you know you can shift just after 1k rpm and it'll still pull But, shifting below 2000 rpm or just before the turbo activates, might feel better for the FE, but the engine strained more and required more throttle input, hence using more fuel. I started to find the sweet spot only after driving 3000km, when my gear shifts started to coincide with the 'upshift arrow' indicated on the MID. This is somewhere around 2200-2500 rpm. So now, with 8800km on the odo, I'm getting very good FE figures, even in the city with the AC off and reasonably better with the AC on. I apologize for making this into a story of sorts, but I'm glad that TeamBHP provides a platform where people don't think I'm crazy for writing so much In short: 1) Shift around 2000-2200 rpm (w/o AC) or 2200-2500 rpm (with AC, yes! I've noticed that it makes a difference) 2) Don't strain the car in high gears, doesn't help! 3) Tyre pressure!!!!!!!! 36psi is perfect. 4) The AC compressor exerts quite a load on the engine (especially since it's a 1.0L); hence you give more throttle input, hence less FE. 5) XP95 has given me 3-4 kmpl more on an average, so does Shell Regular. PS: I also use this press-depress method with the throttle (ie. 2sec on and off) which significantly improves the FE, especially on highways or in 4th or 5th gear. Hope this helps!

How true is this. Is the internet referring to similar CVT boxes as used in Magnite. Kindly guide me. I did my research too. Yes, Nissan CVTs have very bad reputation. You will often see comments like ""Avoid Nissan CVTs like plague"". See below points before you make a decision. Con: 1. Google search for ""Nissan CVT lawsuit"". Lot of people were having problems with Nissan CVTs in the past. Not sure about current situation. 2. Nissan admitted no wrongdoing but has agreed to extend the warranty on the CVT for some 2014-2018 models. 3. The problems were reported on older models, not sure if newer models will suffer the same fate. 4. Nissan uses/used jatco CVTs, which have a very bad reputation. Magnite comes with xtronic. Sounds new tech, hope it won't have any problems. 5. Scotty Kilmer hates Nissan. But he also hates Hyundai too!! Pro: 1. Some said - even for those older models, they didn't see any problems. Their claim was - all CVTs are the same, you have to take care of them with periodic maintenance and not drive them hard. They claimed that all the people who reported problems were either driving too hard on their cars or didn't take care of maintenance much. Some are religiously loyal to Nissan too(family car). I know it was kind of a bad bet, but still went ahead with buying Magnite CVT. My reasons were 1. None of the other CSUV automatic cars, within my budget, fit me (I'm a bit tall) 2. On paper, magnite appeared like a solid VFM car in every aspect. All the features within relatively low cost. 3. Good reviews from team bhp and other sites. None of them suggested to avoid due to Nissan CVT reliability. Not blaming them, but I thought Nissan might have fixed the problems in newer models, or maybe, its just that typical Indian car owner is very careful with their cars, so the CVT problems won't happen. Besides, Magnite wouldn't be a huge hit if there are any problems, lot of people bought it and are still buying it.

326, mytorciar , 13:20 ,Newbie,"Dear Team-BHP and Forum Members, I am very glad that I joined this very well informed and helpful group. I have been following the posts in different forums and am very very impressed by the quantum of knowledge members posses on various aspects. Even more satisfying is the level of information presented with great lucidity and clarity. I am a 68 yrs old veteran Air Force officer settled in Noida (UP). This is my first post here. Coming to Nissan Magnite Turbo CVT Prem, the car which I have booked couple of weeks ago and have been promised delivery within 4 to 6 weeks (CSD Purchase). I do suspect that my choice may raise eyebrows of some esteemed members and I do confess that my choice may prove to be a gamble. But, at my age and inclinations, I probably can afford to gamble :-) My main reasons for selecting this car are: 1. Wanted to shift to an automatic car - have been driving a Maruti Ritz ZXi for nearly last ten years - flawless and without any hassles. Automatic is needed for self and wife, both advancing in age. City driving is killing on the knees. 2. Sedans were discarded because of low seating and difficult ingress and exit, for us. Ritz is very comfortable in this respect and we are quite used to that. 3. Budget - as usual is limited ( but i went overboard!). 4. Liked the look of the car - chose Blade Silver color. 5. Seems a perfect replacement for the Ritz - size (parking issues), seating ergonomics, etc. 6. Test drove Renault Kiger and Magnite on the same day - selection was difficult. Kiger's driving seat seemd a little too cluttered and gave a 'boxed-in' feel with so much of storage area having been built. 7. First choice before the test drive was Tata Punch - but despite several attempts with different agencies, there was no response for a test drive. Eventually the test drive was given to me after three weeks and after the day I had done TD on both the Magnite and Kiger. 8. Now having driven the CVT (both K and M), the AMT on the Punch was a let down - though, like others, I would also have gotten used to the AMT in due course. 9. Inside the Punch, i felt like i was in an armored personnel carrier - looked and felt really tough and rugged. The M and the K felt more sophisticated and nicer. 10. Also, did some discussions with others and got some special professional advise from other groups like this. 11. Took the family for a re-view of Kiger and Magnite. All decided on Magnite, with Kiger coming a close second. 12. Most of our driving will be in the city with probably one to two annual trips on highways. 13. As amount of driving is also limited - home, golf course, visiting both daughters on either side of Noida, am not unduly concerned about the KMP; though from gleaning thru the advice on the forum, have understood that my driving should be 'peaceful', not too aggressive and proper maintenance is a must for a better experience. 14. As I am buying thru the Canteen Stores Deptt., I could go for the highest option (Turbo CVT Prem) - as there was no cruise control on the Turbo CVT & some other baubles (not necessities). 15. On professional advice, I am also opting for the Extended Warranty and Service Pack, both for of five years, and also taking insurance from the agency. I learned this from reading about the travails of another member who was hassled in buying from Policybazar. 16. After much study and analysis on the possible options - finally decided on Magnite (though wife also gave ultimatum!). Now, from the group, I request for help and advice on the following: 1. Are there any essential actions I need to do after I get the car - like getting / replacing any accessories? ( i am opting for their basic accessories kit). 2. Anything i need to focus on during the PDI / paperwork - I have got the BHP PDI checklist. Its pretty exhaustive. 3. Anything i need to watch out for initial period and first service? 4.

The CVT rubber banding is minimal to non-existent and if you drive sedately there is absolutely no issues with mileage or power. I'd recommend the tech pack - its a dealer installed pack (and a bit expensive for whats on offer at about 30k INR like all such dealer fitments) - but it adds a few things that you may like - like a better speaker (JBL branded), multi-color ambient lights (its nice to have when you are parked at night or are out on a leisure drive) puddle lamps (again nice to have imo).

Ceramic coating (and also graphene coating) will cost anywhere from 20-30k INR and is mostly just a cosmetic thing with questionable improvements on durability. It'll only help avoid the most minor of scratches - the kind called swirls which are usually caused by dust being wiped over the paint. Ceramic coating is basically a think layer of Si02 being applied which has similar hardness as fine glassy dust - the kind that you get when you do a highway run or drive in sandy areas. Brushing them onto a car which has ceramic coating will still result in fine scratches being formed over time. Good quality self-healing poly-urethane PPF is too expensive for a car in this segment (70k+) even though it can do a better job of protection from gentle scratches. Cheaper PPF usually runs into issues somewhere past the 5 year marks, so thats another problem. Its simply cheaper to repaint the entire car if so desired. If you park in dusty areas by all mean use a car cover. If you care about avoiding swirls (personally I dont, they are not noticeable to me and it takes too much effort - usually futile - to try to avoid them) then you would want to find someone that does touchless water washes of your car. If you are the DIY kind, you may be interested in the Jopasu dusters. The best bet for protecting paint would probably just be to get the car waxed every 6 months and and polish with a compound maybe once a year at a decent detailing studio. That'd not just keep the car looking good, but also be easier on the pocket. If you drive on the highways the road+wind noise can be a factor for increased fatigue. While there isn't much you can do about wind noise the road noise can be reduced with better tyres and adding insulation to the car. If you are thinking of tyre-change they need to be changed quickly after the purchase of the car (negotiate with a nearby tyre shop for the exchange price even before the purchase of the car is complete) to not lose more money during exchange, the insulation part can be added anytime later. Misc (nothing specific to a new car): I highly recommend buying a portable tyre inflator -preferably one thats powered by the 12V socket (you must keep the engine running when using it though - its too heavy for the battery alone to handle). I also recommend a good puncture repair kit, a glass breaker+ seatbelt cutter and a small fire extinguisher in the car.

You will really enjoy the turbo kicking in and the car is comfortable and stable at triple digits speeds as well. Coming from the Petrol Ritz, it will feel like a good power upgrade, but the refinement levels are slightly on the lower side with the 3-cyl idle vibrations. 5) I went for the XV variant, as I did not require the additional features of the XV Premium. But I can assure you that the number of features that comes stock is more than sufficient and I've never felt the need to upgrade or add accessories. The essential accessories costed Rs.2500 and I went for that. I would suggest you go for the XV Premium, if you can, as the cruise control, 360 deg camera and rear AC vents are quite practical upgrades. Not a big fan of the all-black interior though. 6) PDI - please do look at the finishing of interiors and check the paint coat. With respect to the driving part, I would recommend not exceeding 3000 rpm for the first 500-1000 km, so gentle driving for that part. The Ceat tires are grippy and I recommend maintaining 36psi. (I always get it checked when I fuel up) I genuinely hope you have a stress-free and pleasant experience with the Magnite, in all aspects, sir!", 22nd February 2023,Bengaluru,35,51,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

334, mytorciar , 14:02 ,Newbie,Thanks a lot for the great information. Under my circumstances I am going for the Turbo CVT Prem and I do hope that the car will remain trouble free. Reg the warranty and service pack - it was suggested to me (thru another website) that I should go for the five year pack - as you are also suggesting. I am going to do that. I will also keep in mind the recommended tire pressure. I trust I will be able to be a 'sedate driver' though I do not really understand how I can control the rpm levels - probably use a light foot on the accelerator?

336, Sid13 , 18:51 ,BHPian,"Today went to Nissan showroom in Kochi, the showroom was under maintenance (Painting etc). However 4 vehicles were on display. The sales staff were nowhere to be seen in the front area and on asking a house keeping staff a lady and a guy came. After that, the sales staff were supportive in explaining the vehicle and helping to understand features and variants. I couldn't get a test drive as the vehicle was away on a test drive and was not expected to be back till evening. However, sat inside the base variant of CVT as well as the top-end(Without Tech Opt) variant of the manual. The instant feeling inside the vehicle appears congested. However I know for a fact that it is not true, coming from a Polo, the interiors are actually more spacious, there is more headroom and legroom in front and rear. However, the front seat appeared less comfortable and less spacious(I think it has to do with weak under-thigh support). The rear had plenty of space behind the driver seat after adjusting the driver seat to my setting. However, the rear seat was more bench-like and did not have enough contours. The lean angle was too upright for my comfort. The dark interiors made me feel a bit claustrophobic despite the availability of a decent amount of space (it may have partially to do with the lack of lighting inside the showroom as maintenance was ongoing). It was quite apparent that the vehicle is made to a cost and this was evident from the quality of the interior plastic, paint job, and interior fit and finish. However, Nissan has tried very hard and succeeded to an extent in making it not too obvious. They have agreed to bring the CVT version for a test drive as early as possible. The final decision shall be taken after spending more time inside the vehicle and driving it. However coming from VW, my eyes catch quality issues too quickly in most of the vehicles I experience, with Nissan it was a bit too easy (Compared to Honda City and even Suzuki Brezza I experienced today). The reason I am still looking forward to test-driving the Magnite is, despite its obvious shortcomings, the CVT version seems to be hard to beat VFM.", 25th February 2023,Kochi,135,68,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

338, rishil.ghurki , 09:10 ,BHPian,"Let me answer your question in short: if you're coming from a Polo, the Magnite might not be the car for you. Here's the long version: The Polo is quintessentially German! It's build quality is far better than anything in the same price range today. I've driven my Magnite for 10.5K in 1 year now and so far I haven't noticed any rattling from the all-plastic interior. But, I cannot assure you that I'll stay the same for the next 7 years, even though it's from a Japanese brand, Nissan. Coming to the comfort. I'm very surprised that you found the Magnite to be claustrophobic. I had 2 six-footers plus a medium sized passenger in by back seat from Bangalore to Chennai and they were astonished with the amount of space back there (do note that I'm quite short 5'5"" but I keep my seat a little behind on longer journeys). The actual seat on my XV Turbo is slightly on the firmer side and has fabric upholstery. In short, I personally love the seat! Most of my usage is on the highway (70-80%) and firm cushioning is better for such usage. But, I understand your comparison to the Polo. My friend owns a Polo GT TSI 1.0 back in his hometown and every time he travels in my Magnite, he says that the seats are too firm, but he doesn't complain about under-thigh support, as he too is around my height. The Magnite has 2nd best-in-class practicality and space (second to the Nexon). Disregarding the XUV300 for it's non-updated design and an excuse for boot space, the Magnite is actually a great offering. Also note that the Magnite's handling is simply: not good! The Polo will have spoilt you, sir! My humble suggestion would be to go for the 1.0L Taigun (MT or the 6-spd Torque-Converter is equally good). I'm sure it will not feel as well built as the Polo (considering the MQBA0-IN platform), but it comes close!

It sure does help! Thanks a tonne for such detailed well thought out response. I test drove Magninte CVT PRE today on all kinds of roads and traffic conditions. Its absolute VFM! The engine and CVT combo is just great. Its perfect for tight city traffic due to lite steering, good visibility and compact dimensions. The convenience CVT offers is great. The fact that its an extremely good gear box with almost non existent rubber band effect makes its a breeze to drive in city and decent on highways. About what I mentioned about rear seat of Magnite feeling claustrophobic, I had mentioned that depsite being way more spacious than Polo, I felt the rear to be claustrophobic probably because of all the all dark treatment, adding to it was dull light inside the showroom. You are lucky that the interiors doesn't rattle. Let it be that way the entire lifetime of your vehicle. The car I test drove today had 600kms on odo. While driving through a concrete brick laid road and some bad patches, the dashboard had rattle sounds coming from various points resembling a dts atmos sound system. The rattles were coming from multiple points that I couldnt figure out where it was from. I immediately asked the sales executive who was on co driver seat about the same and he said most magnites have same issue! Now your vehicle not having this issue, points at lack of consistency in production process. I think the full digital meter and information console suits an arcade game(However its not a deal breaker for me, it shows what its suppose to show, although not in way I personally prefer) I found the suspension to be on firmer side but it is not uncomfortable. The same offers good stability at speeds up to 90 Kms (max i could test) Wife said she could feel expansion joints inside but it was much better than Polo. Overall I feel Magnite CVT is great VFM. What worried me is the build quality.

Right now, most issues are being shoved under the 'warranty-umbrella', hence not much is coming to light either. I personally feel that the interiors could have definitely been better put together.

I own a XV Pre CVT and I am happy with the car except the rattling issues - I used to drive a 2016 S-Cross and there were no unwanted noises inside the car after 4 years and 53K kms, but I could hear rattling from Magnite's dashboard from the second week. One good thing: The rattling is constant, my odo reads 18K, the sounds are same as how it was initially, not increased and I take it positively. But whatever the service centre does, the sounds return within a weeks time. Mine is one among the initial batches that were manufactured; the new cars are better in this regard is what I understand from other owners who purchased Magnite recently. Another concern is about the after sales support from Nissan. Overall Magnite CVT is a VFM car and also a balanced one. I got mine for 11.25 Lakhs OTR and that makes me forget about all other issues. I was not so happy during the initial days of ownership, but now learned to live with the niggles. Since you have been using a Polo, you would notice vibrations and rattling which are not familiar to you from everywhere - dashboard, doors, bumpers and so on; but you will get adjusted to that.

346, balmagbrezjim , 07:49 ,Newbie,"We have the XV Premium CVT variant and right from the beginning, the warning lights w.r.t ESC, ABS, Hill hold usually comes up whenever there was a three point manouvre in tight parking spaces and the warning lights won't go. The solution was to switch off and on the car completely after a few minutes. The warning signs are still there but with break pedal pressed and a slight steering movement, all the warning signs disappear. It was a major eyesore as well as inconvience. During the first service, the service centre guys finally accepted that yes, there is a problem and the whole ABS module needs to be changed. Any owner who has faced this issue??? Also, there was this steering alignment towards the right and a right pull while driving in a straight line right from the beginning. The vehicle was at the service centre on the very next day of delivery and they fixed the alignment issue. Now after the 1st service, when I took the trial, the same issue cropped up. The guys kept me waiting till 7:30 PM till they did multiple wheel alignment/steering adjustments and trials. After so much frustration, I got the vehicle back and still there is a very miniscule amount of steering misalignment and right pull which I only am experiencing. The guys told me that they will fix all the problems at the time of ABS module replacement.

347, Transmission , 20:38 ,BHPian,"Completed the PDI of my Magnite and now expecting delivery next week hopefully. Here is the sum of my observations/feelings so far with the car as well as the dealership (Surya Nissan, Bangalore). Pros: 1. Sales folks are always polite - even when I could have been a little annoyying with my persistent calls/messages to them regarding delivery date slips. 2. Test drive was prompt and at my home exactly at the promised date and time. 3. The car drives well. In sport mode the CVT rubber-banding or turbo lag is almost not present with the car reacting spiritedly to any pressure on the accelerator pedal. Ride quality wise the car feels most similar to the XUV700 in how it reacts to the road - suspension is a little bit on the harder side, but not overly so. Like the XUV700, the brake pedal engages most of its stopping power late into the action, (unlike the i10 I currently drive which starts acting early) - which I am not a big fan of. Braking control is best when you can keep your heel anchored on the floor, and having most of braking force available late ruins that much like how a long-action clutch is poor for ergonomics. Steering feels a little smaller, but nothing to fuss about. Dead pedal is present in the CVT turbo variant (but slightly poorly placed). 4. Car has the basics covered - good seats, good rear seat thigh support, rear wipers, and even has additional (premium?) features that I value: traction and vehicle dynamic control, cruise control, 360 camera etc. Music system is nothing special - but perfectly acceptable for the price. Adding side airbags would have been great, but atleast the bodyshell is worth a 4 star GNCAP. 5. PDI was smooth and I couldn't find any issues with the car. They were very open to my PDI at their stockyard, and allowed me all the time I needed to check the car - visual, under the hood and engine + AC + ICE features. As expected, I wasn't allowed to drive - but the car was driven (a little aggressively, if I may add) some 50m from the parking to the inspection shed. Odometer reading was just 5km during the PDI at their stockyard. 6. Going by my reading of the Magnite's Vietnamese webpages it is E20 rated too... On the other hand the sales experience has been pretty poor. I dont think there is any malice, but there definitely is gross mismanagement/incompetence. Cons: 1. The test drive car had run about 15k kms and had a cacophony of interior noises: grinding brake noise at slow speed braking and interior rattles from places too many to count. I went ahead with the booking anyways because I had solicited feedback from Magnite owners here and they mostly seemed to be happy about the car with low likelihood of the issues I noted during the test drive. TBH, I still have a some light lingering fear about the issues I saw in the test drive car that had only run 15k kms. 2. Delivery dates (which seemed optimistic anyways) were repeatedly missed. Every enquiry about missing delivery date found a very polite sales person, but no actual useful information was forthcoming and successive delivery dates were missed. I kept asking them at regular intervals until their head of customer care emailed me with a date - which was finally the one that was met (in that the car was described as ready and VIN was shared, not delivery though). I am pretty sure they lied to me multiple times - about delivery dates, about delays caused (""no cars are being billed from the factory due to BS6 changes, sir"" - in February - whcih is a lie because Nissan basically has one car that sells the Magnite and Nissan sold practically identical number of cars in January as well as February.) 3. Handling of insurance details/documents has been (polite, but) terrible - no details were provided except a hand written quote at first. Then a proposal document was sent which atleast had more numbers - but still no brochure or terms and conditions document. I was sent a terms and conditions document from Icici Lombard when I pressed on for one - while the policy they offer is from MS Chola . For details on the addons I was asked (politely) to check the website. 4. The on-road price ""quote"" given to me was hand written numbers on a printed sheet with blanks - and after a bit of back and forth about insurance prices, the final ""quote"" for the on-road price was summed up wrong (it was less than the real sum/total). It took them a few hours to realize their mistake (after I made the original payment) and reach out to me again for the additional sum.

Never noticed whether there's any delay on using the wipers so no comments there Thank you for the comment, akg. I had followed your story here closely (and it worried me as I had also booked a Magnite). Glad to see that your ordeals seem to have been all sorted out now! There is no jerk when shifting from any gear to D. The jerk happens only when I release the brake - even if its about 5 seconds after D had been selected. For clarity here is the sequence of events: 1. Car is stationary - with the engine running - in some gear other than D (lets say the current gear is P) 2. I press and hold brake and shift gear to D. There is no jerk felt at this time. 3. I keep the brake pressed for another 5 seconds (There is no jerk felt all this time waiting) 4. After 5 seconds, I release the brake now to move forward. The car moves forward with a slight initial jerk/jump - sometimes. The jerk happens only sometimes and not always, and like you noted feels like a clutch engagement. Just trying to see if anyone else also had observed it. My previous experience is with a Grand i10 AT and it doesn't have this behaviour (In the i10 the slight jerk if any only happens in step 2 above). As for the engine braking, I am very sure that it increases slightly around 24-25kmph on my car. As mild as it is, I can feel it even without looking at the speedometer. Lets see how its after the first checkup at 2000KMs. I intend to do a (paid) oil change anyways - though when I last checked the oil at about 1000KMs the oil looked pretty clean. Also, will start a review + ownership thread very soon, including all the slight modifications I do/plan to do to the car (like changing internal lights to LEDs, adding a IRVM dashcam to act as an auto dimming IRVM/ blind spot helper, and possibly adding ambient lights as well as replacing the fog lamps with something that I can actually have some use of...

The jerk is minor - and feels no different than a newbie engaging the clutch a little too quickly on a manual gearbox. For some reason this doesn't happen at step 4 with the i10 AT I currently drive (in the i10 I feel the gearbox engage only in step 2 - but since the car is stationary at step 2 there is no real jerk, just a small body shake/vibration) so was wondering if the Magnite's behaviour was somehow unexpected.

367, Nester , 09:42 ,Newbie,"A strange experience that I am sharing with all here. But I do it to make you aware that such a thing could happen..... I drive a Magnite AT , and mostly drive alone with no co-passengers. I have the habit of keeping the key fob on the seat next to the driver , or the tray next to the driver ( left side ) or in my left side pocket or in the tray under the dashboard . A couple of weeks back , I am driving and I hear the keys falling on the floor of the magnite. I say no big deal and continue driving. When I reach my destination and search for the Key Fob I cannot find it anywhere. After many many thorough searches by me and my family, and being told that I am a complete fool and I dropped it somewhere on the road ( no one telling me how exactly I managed to do that ),I reconciled myself that i must have dropped the key somewhere else. It kept nagging me however especially when I was very positive I did hear the key falling sound while driving ( and the cost of a new key hob being 7K ). I did not want to let it go . One fine day I looked in the interiors very very closely and realised that there is a small space at the bottom of the parking brake when the parking brake is lowered while driving where the key could slide through . I went to the Nissan service centre with my theory ( assuming that they too would laugh at my theory the same way my family did ) and they were very cool about it . They told me it happens a lot with Magnites and they had same issues earlier with key fobs being found in the cavity . Long story short , they found the key in the cavity where the parking brake sits. I am not very technical from an automobile perspective and cant explain it further but in case you do lose the key, do take a look at that spot. I am guessing that this space will be in all cars when the parking brake is lowered so not a design flaw per se .", 15th May 2023,Mumbai,9,15,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Negative

369, mytorciar , 18:44 ,Newbie,"Thank you for your insightful information and observations. These had helped me in making up my mind to go for the Magnite CVT Turbo Premium, which I got delivered on 28 mar23 from YouWe&Cars, Okhla, Delhi NCR. Some impressions are given below, having done about 1600 kms. There is a large amount of information, observations, comments and doubts in the forum about Magnite. Rightly so, as the learned members are very well informed and clueful and even perhaps - demanding. At my age, and life experience, maybe I am less so. But the details are enlightening. YouWe&Cars: An overall pleasant experience with the agency. Helpful and attentive people, well kept showroom, they look after the visitors. After completing the booking formalities (purchase thru CSD), it took about a month to get the car into my hands. They helped with the PDI, explained in detail about the various functions and gizmos. I opted for the extended warranty and the service pack for 5 yrs - this was on the suggestion of another website's experts recommendations. Would defintely recommend this agency to others. Neo Nissan, I was told, was shut down by Nissan India due to some financial imbroglio! Though i did get my refund of the booking amount. Magnite: As said previously, this is my first automatic car. I drove the Ritz Zxi for nearly 10 years - a flawless and absolutely trouble free performance ! Now the Ritz has been handed over to my elder daughter for her daily commute to and from office and showing off to her hubby. **__First impressions:__** The Magnite is a lovely car!!! Easy to drive, easier to handle and performs as expected from a NEW and ADVANCED car. Basically a family car, we still have not taken her for an extended drive on the highway, but I am sure we are going to be pleasantly surprised and satisfied. I had test driven the Kiger and te Magnite on the same day, within few hours of each other, the overall experience of Magnite was better. The Kiger's insides were a little overwhelming and I felt cramped on the driver's seat. Driving wise, there was hardly any difference, but then, a few kms. drive is insufficient to really map this out. 2. **Regn Process: **I live, in Noida (UP), the car agency is in Delhi NCR and the temp regn was paid from their Faridabad (Haryana) office. So the Temp RC was entitled "" Govt of Haryana"", which was a bit confusing for me, till i was explained so by the agency. But due to this tri-state transaction, i still have not got the physical paper/card RC . I also was under the impression that the Temp RC is valid for 30 days and I should not drive out-of-state (my ten year old info), but it seems that nowadays it Temp RC is valid pan-India for six months. However, the bender is that within few days of the agency paying the regn fee, i got an SMS from the tpt authority about my actual regn number, which was then thankfully uploaded on the M'Parivahan app and Digilocker. BUT RC book is still missing!! It is nearly two months of ownership. 3. **Drive experience:** It is a fun car to drive. Took a little time to get hands-on, moving from a MT to a CVT. I have not noticed any jerks on the car moving from stationary, OR, if there were, i have ignored. Being older and slower, I do move from P->N->D. I find the D placement a little counter-intuitive as I have to move the rod bckwards towards me for the car to go forward. Must be some very good reason for this. 4. Took some time getting used to how to set the cruise control. But its fun to drive that a way, albeit, not many roads in Delhi to be able to do say at a higher speed. Most of Delhi is now locked in at 50 kmph. 5. Have not used the sports mode, except once on a short highway run. I don't know when and where it will be useful and desireable. **6. Random question: Should one use sports mode along with cruise control while driving on highways? (b) is sports mode useful/better for hill driving? I do hope that the car will be able to take on the heights of the northern hill stations without a problem. Any tips on safe hill driving the CVT are most welcome.** 7. Since, my driving is not much, i am not unduly concerned about the effective mileage - a major question for all of us since ages!. However, it stands to reason that maybe after 2-3000 kms, the mileage will actually settle down despite the number of factors affecting fuel efficiency. 8. Following from the above, indeed, my touch on the pedal has to be feather lite and that's fun. The power to the wheels is transmitted smoothly, no jerks, and very slight delay when moving from inertia. But it is very very good. And with cruise control on, the right leg can give company to the left - which is now not being use except to keep time to the music. The AV system is good and plenty of oomph on the sound volume. 9. The interiors are good, storage is spacious and the rear seat passengers have praised the seating and looks. The AC is effective and cools fast, when used properly. Outside temp is around 42 C, so bringing it down to 25/26 takes only a couple of minutes. 10. Magnite looks grand and different from most other similar looking SUVs or cars of this size. 11. To both, my wife and I, this is turning out to be a wonderful purchase and we strongly feel, that is going to be so in the next few years. Planning to take this on a longish drive soon. 12. These are fist impressions, written down hastily. Will try and follow up after the 'longish' drive. Best of luck, all.", 20th May 2023,noida,8,11,Drivetrain,Very Positive
370, vamsi.vadrevu , 22:48 ,BHPian,"Hello everyone! I'm am considering the Magnite Turbo CVT XV Premium variant in Hyderabad. I stay about 10 minutes from Lakshmi Nissan (Nagole) showroom and service center and got to test drive the vehicle yesterday for a substantial amount of time. I've only begun shortlisting cars to purchase, I'm quite confused and can't come to a solid conclusion yet. I'm looking for a good city car with a proper automatic transmission (CVT, TC, DCT) and good ground clearance with safety and good power on tap. I was only able to shortlist Magnite, Kiger, Altroz DCA, Brezza VXI (6 speed TC) and Nexon XMA. I had to discard Altroz because of low power, Brezza because of exorbitant pricing and Nexon for the AMT. Kiger and Magnite were the only ones that made sense to me. I'm coming from a 2013 Alto K10 (my father's car) and so I found everything about Magnite quite good compared to the Alto. I just have a few concerns before I take the plunge and I hope bhpians here might be able to point me in the right direction. 1. How is the service experience from Lakshmi Nissan (Nagole). 2. Are there going to be any transmission related issues with the XTronic. 3. Is the gearbox and engine fully manufactured in India? 4. Has there been any spare parts availability issues with Magnite CVT? 5. Have there been any stories of the CVT breaking down?

Now I am evaluating other automatic options till the time Punch arrives. I am open to cancellation of Punch. Also I actually don't need a 2nd car, as I am the only one in my family who drive now. Just because I am getting bored of driving one car (Vento TDI DSG), taking a 2nd one. A smaller footprint and higher seating car will be surely more convenient for city usage. The engine & CVT combo of Magnite is way superior to Punch. Though AMT is kind of ok in Punch, the pick up of the car is too slow. Even then I am inclined more towards Punch for the following reasons- 1. 5 star safety against 4 star. 2. To me Punch looks better. 3. Interior of Punch feels better. 4. AC effectiveness is better in Punch ( from TD experience). 5. 90 degree door opening in Punch. 6. Punch will be more fuel efficient. I still want to consider Magnite only for the power and seemless CVT it offers without perceptible rubber band effect. While TD I got the FE in MID reset and after the TD I got a reading of 13.5 kmpl. In same condition, my Vento would have shown 20 kmpl. While taking TD of Punch in another route, I got a MID FE of 17.5 kmpl. I apprehend that Magnite CVT may be approx 4 kmpl less fuel efficient than Punch AMT, which is a concern for me.

Using Sports mode with cruise control is a bit counterintuitive, don't you think? You'll get better fuel efficiency in the D mode. However, you'll have to consult the Magnite user manual or experiment by yourself to see if it indeed works! Most automatics will work fine in the hills in D mode.

Using Sports mode with cruise control is a bit counterintuitive, don't you think? You'll get better fuel efficiency in the D mode. However, you'll have to consult the Magnite user manual or experiment by yourself to see if it indeed works! Most automatics will work fine in the hills in D mode. However, to reduce the dependency on the brakes and prevent brake fade, use the L mode on steep mountain roads where you need engine braking. >> Thanks a lot for your information. Just what i wanted.

Any tips on safe hill driving the CVT are most welcome.** Sports mode in different cars means different things so unfortunately there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer for this question. But since the car we have here is the Magnite we know what its sports mode does: it simply holds the rpms high-ish (about 2000+ rpm) even when not needed. What this means is: 1. Fuel consumption mostly goes up (lesser mileage) 2. Better responsiveness from previously low-rpm situations since the car is always in the meat of the engine's powerband That second point is perhaps the most important. For example, if you are not in the sports mode right behind a slow moving truck then when you want to overtake it and press the accelerator, the engine has to spin up to the higher-rpm range (1800+rpm) to make all of its torque/power available - this is normal. But if you use the sports mode just (maybe 1-2 seconds) before pressing the accelerator, then the engine rpms rise to ~2000 before you press the accelerator and now the car responds quicker - since the engine is already in the rpm range where it produces most torque/power. I use it almost exclusively for this purpose when stuck behind slow traffic - since I like to spend the least amount of time side by side with another vehicle for safety reasons. It certainly makes a noticeable difference to the responsiveness of the car from low rpm (ie low speed) situations and I was quite pleased by it in a recent ghat drive. Also, while sports mode is nice for quicker overtakes (especially in the ghats), you dont really need it for general hill-climbing. I had to climb a couple of ridiculously graded (meaning very steep) climbs from very slow speed/standstill in a recent visit to a hill station (Madikeri) and I missed a turn and had to reroute through some narrow and steep uphill concrete roads - and I never even needed to press the accelerator all that much to get moving or maintain the climb with one other passenger in the car.

Idle rpm is ~1000, with AC turned off. I believe it should be low? 800? What idle rpm are you seeing? 2. Jerky behavior when braking, even at low speeds. I don't do any sudden brakes, am very gentle. Still, sometimes, at the very end, the car is applying a sudden brake by itself, which results in quickly and abruptly stopping the car and a forward jerk. This is very discomforting for the people inside car and the driver has to be extra careful with applying the brake. I think this could be due to ABS, but it’s odd that it happens even during slow speeds. 3. FE in Bumper to bumper traffic is very low. Odometer shows 5/6. Its kinda fine if I go to higher speeds though. Odometer shows ~12 at higher speeds.

I'm not an expert about engines in general, but you might want to get this checked just to be on the safer side. 2. Here are two observations about the braking: (a) jerky and grinding effect up to 1km after an overnight or long park and (b) the sudden jerky effect you're experiencing is probably due to the Brake Assist feature activating even at low speeds. I evade this by adjusting with the clutch and engine braking, with my MT. 3. I too had single digit avg. FE figures at the beginning in bumper-to-bumper traffic. 7-8 was normal with the MT (for reference: I do not ride the clutch, I live in Bengaluru and AC is always ON). It was only post 4000km for me, that both the powertrain started to mature and so did my driving skills. Now, post 10,000 km I see 9-11 kmpl in bumper-to-bumper traffic, 11-13 kmpl in normal traffic and 15-16 kmpl in non-traffic city driving (however occasional in BLR ) The beauty of turbo petrols is how versatile they can be.

I am planning for my first car, and as my wife insists on a SUVish kind of vehicle, so Hatchbacks and Sedans are out of the shortlist. I wanted an Automatic transmission vehicle for our convenience as we would use it mostly for city rides. However, as I have to work from home and my wife has a very small commute on the not to busy Greater Noida roads, It won't be running much. So, petrol trims are fine for us. Further, my budget limit is in the range of 10-12 L on the road and I would ideally like it to be below 10 L ex-showroom (12 L is the highest limit). Given these conditions, there are only two vehicles in sight for me. I have zeroed down on Magnite XV CVT and Nexon XM AMT. I have huge confusion. While TD wasn't quite comfortable with Nexon AMT due to the lag, however, it ticked all the other department, the built, interiors, sturdiness and ride quality of Nexon is amazing. Magnite XV CTV on the other hand offers an amazingly smooth CVT transmission and a nice peppy 1.0 turbo engine, along with all the other added features making it a complete package and good value-for-money proposition. But, the ASS and dealership issues of Nissan (especially in Delhi NCR) are a serious put-off. Adding to this is the Game of Thrones-style corporate politics going on at the global level in Nissan (Recently COO resigned and there are also allegations that CEO was spying on COO- Is it a car company or the KGB) I am hugely confused and would like the fellow BHPians to guide me through this and also suggest any other alternatives (I am not considering Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai or KIA for the safety issues with their vehicles) Also, if I had to compromise on the automatic transmission and drop it from my list of must-have, then I am also contemplating Nexon MT lower trims below 10 L ex-showroom in the upcoming facelift.

I really love sedans and manuals but my city conditions forced me to drop low ground clearance sedans and manual transmission options. And an automatic is just easier to drive even for novice drivers. If you are going to wait, you'd probably have to wait til December because that's usually around the time Tata releases new models or facelifts. But it's doubtful if they'll release the new Nexon with the DCA gearbox that is in altroz. And even if they do, the prices aren't going to be palatable. Just look at the market trend for sub compact SUVs. The pricing is insane. Some of these exceed better built sedans like Honda City! Pricing probably isn't going to be good even if Nexon comes with DCA in the facelift. And AMT is a compromised experience. It does get the job done but it's not pretty. You're constantly aware of what the car is trying to do and it's inconsistent and will get on your nerves. If you're going to compromise and get manual transmission, you'd better go with brezza (it has 4 star safety same as magnite) or Nexon. If, however, automatic is preferred, there's no better option than magnite or kiger for you for the price. I've been driving the xv premium CVT for the past 750km and I can vouch for it's smoothness and relaxed driving in city conditions. You barely need to put any thought into driving it. The only niggles are with interior fitment (rattles) and some QC issues here and there. I bought magnite knowing these because I really liked the engine and gearbox combo. It's just that good! Be mindful that the quality of interiors is indeed kwid or Alto K10 level (may be a tad better), but Nissan spent it's money on the engine and transmission and safety rather than the interior fitment.

The sound we hear from brakes is probably the brake pads sticking to the brake rotor. And because it happens at parking speeds when starting and stopping, the rotors and pads are rubbing and probably vibrating (misaligned pads maybe?). The same issue is probably also causing the jerk the first time you release the brakes. The brakes are only ""unsticking"" after a certain amount of torque is applied on wheels and that's when they are suddenly getting released causing the jerk. I'm not sure if what I've said makes any sense but that's what it feels like to me. I need to take it to the service center and get the brake pads and rotors cleaned up and check if the pads are returning back freely after applying brakes. As for the jerk, when you're about to release the brakes, just pump them quickly once or twice before the vehicle moves, and the brake pads will unstick and you won't feel the jerk.

Also, you'll hear a lot of suspension noise. I've had my front doors start to rattle at 100km when going over slight bumps too! I think, the windows when rolled up completely, are probably not seated well enough and are rattling in their positions. They don't rattle if they're even slightly below their fully closed positions.

I play my favorite tunes and the rattles and suspension noise no longer bother me at all! Stock speakers are quite serviceable unless you're an audiophile.

405, vamsi.vadrevu , 17:58 ,BHPian,"Hi All, I wanted to know how you had performed the break-in for your new car. Should we get the engine oil changed at 2000km (the first free inspection)? I understand that during the break-in period, the engine cylinder walls and pistons undergo some wearing off and these metal particles end up in the engine oil. So, shouldn't an engine oil change be performed at 2000km just as a precaution? Considering Nissan's general after-sales, I'd like to be safer in the long run by spending a little upfront. Manufacturer recommended oil change is at 10000km intervals, I intend to get it performed at every 8000km because I don't really trust Nissan's recommendations (considering the fact that they don't even recommend a CVT ATF fluid change in the first 60000km! I intend to get the CVT fluid replaced at 30000km intervals just to have a peace of mind for Nissan's CVTs).

412, rishil.ghurki , 16:51 ,BHPian,"Hi Bumblebee. I own a Magnite Turbo XV MT and have clocked 15,000+ km on it. Congratulations on booking the Magnite! 1) I really wanted the Red with the Black roof, but my dealer said that the Dual Tone no longer was available for the Red and it had to be painted at the dealer level, so I simply just decided to go with Blade Silver. While I'm happy with the way it looks in Silver, the Red looks smashing. I would suggest to forget the maintenance part and go with a colour you like! 2) I did not opt for the Gold AMC. My 10k service costed me Rs.2800. Please note that the CVT gearbox does require more maintenance and over time it may end up costing more to service than the MT. 3) I love the fabric seats on the Magnite. Very supportive and feels airy. I usually just vacuum the seats once a month and it's good as new and wipe it down with Savlon wipes once in a while too. But, as the car ages, I am planning to get a seat cover installed. It would be easier to maintain. 4) I changed the OEM mats at 13,000 km to GFX mats. Now, its easier to clean the car and the carpets get less dirty as everything accumulates within the GFX mats. I would recommend going for it.

Are the OEM accessory PVC/3D floor mats good or should I go for something from Amazon,etc? Thanks in advance I was in the same dilemma as you. But I went with White because it had 3 advantages 1. Better visibility at night (safety) (darker colors are harder to see at night) 2. Keeps the insides cooler by at least 10 to 15 degrees compared to other colors when parked in direct sun (less load on AC) 3. Easier to match colors in the event of any touch ups as you mentioned. The red really does look amazing! I almost got the red, but my logical mind prevailed and I went with white (which looks good too IMHO). And I got full floor matting done from outside at 3k. And on top, I just laid down OEM 3d mats. This combo is very easy to maintain. Take the full 5 year Gold AMC. It's a negligible amount in the overall cost of ownership. The prices of air filters, oil filters, engine oil, gaskets etc will eventually rise and you'll probably end up paying almost the same amount or more.", 17th July 2023,Hyderabad,87,179,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

420, madmax_rak , 07:07 ,Newbie,"Hi All While I'm writing this review, my beloved black beauty has crossed 74000 km and is still going strong. This is my first car, and very close to my heart for the same reason. Phase 1 : Thoughts of owning a car Right after my graduation, I joined one of the TATA companies and got placed at their HQ in Mumbai. I had worked in Mumbai for around 4 years and got transferred to my home state, Kerala, in April 2017. I have started thinking of getting a car on my own. This was just a thought, and I did not seriously start looking for a purchase. My job requires travel across the state, and I used to hire self driving cars for local travel. I never liked manual transmissions and was always fond of automatic cars. I used to hire a Nissan Micra CVT for my local travel and I loved the car. I was impressed with its smooth CVT and compact size. So I had visited the Nissan showroom at Kalamassery and they had the Nissan Micra UCB edition in their stock. I had almost made up my mind and discussed it with my family. This was in mid-2018. But for some reason, the final decision was not made and the Micra was discontinued from Nissan's lineup. Phase 2 : Restarting search for a car Once Micra was discontinued, I did not actively search for any cars. I did like the Ford Freestyle. But it did not have an automatic variant. Figo was not to my liking and never considered as an option. Then Covid happened and almost two years have passed without any progress. So finally, I have restarted searching for a car in mid 2020. By that time, compact SUVs were trending and I have considered compact SUVs from Ford, Renault, Hyundai, TATA and Mahindra. Maruti Suzuki was not on the list due to its poor build quality and absence of proper automatic transmissions. So the brands I was looking at were Ford, Renault, Hyundai, TATA and Mahindra. The TATA Nexon and XUV 300 were rejected due to AMT. Renault did not have any compact SUVs at that point in time. Duster was almost out of my budget. So finally, I have shortlisted Venue and Ecosport. I did not like the look of the Venue and poor back seat leg space was also a reason for rejecting the car. Ecosport had ticked all the boxes and the only thing that was pulling me back was the poor mileage of the TC variant. So I was very confused and could not make a final decision. So at that point in time Kia was about to launch Sonet and I had registered an interest through their website. I got a call from the dealership and he had shared the brochure. The tentative on road price was close to 13L for top end petrol. This again caused a dilemma. Phase 3 : Launch of the beauty..! Magnite..! In November 2020, news started floating about the launch of a new car from Nissan. I watched the launch event live and it was the first time I watched a launch event without skipping a second. I liked the car very much and decided to go ahead with the booking. I have made the booking on 2 Dec 2020 online by paying Rs. 11000. This was well before the price announcement. I was ready to stretch my budget as I had really liked the car and having already driven Nissan's CVT was also a reason to fix Magnite as my first car. Phase 4 : Booking and waiting for delivery I have made the booking on 2 Dec 2020. I was supposed to get a callback from the dealership ""EVM Nissan, Nettoor"". I did not receive any calls from the dealer even after 3 days. I tried to call their number, which is available on the Nissan website. The number was incorrect and I have sent a mail to Nissan customercare stating the same. But there was no response from them. Finally, I got the contact number from one of my colleagues and contacted the dealer. The dealer had assigned a salesman and he had called me back and informed me that the booking amount was not yet reflected in dealer's account. It took another week to get a booking confirmation receipt from the dealer. Test drive vehicles have arrived at dealer point and I was totally impressed after the test drive. CVT was butter smooth and sport mode was giving an adrenaline rush. I found Magnite's CVT far superior than the one that was there in Micra. So after the test drive I was eagerly waiting for my car to arrive at dealer point. So it was January 2021, and deliveries have started across Kerala. I have inquired in dealer ship on the status of my booking and they were saying Black colour was yet to get allocated. I have escalated the matter to Nissan management. But there was no help at all. They were directing me back to dealership for updates. Finally, in the third week of February 2021, I got a call from a salesperson saying that the car was allocated. Car loan procedures were already completed and it was ready for disbursal. I have transferred the down payment amount to the dealership and informed them that the loan amount will be transferred once the vehicle has reached the dealership. The car had reached dealership during the last week of February and they have started registration formalities after receiving the balance payment from my end. The total on-road price was around 11Lakhs which includes the extended warranty and gold pack. Phase 5 : Delivery Day.. 01 Mar 2021..! I have bought a black t-shirt to wear on this day. I reached the dealership in the afternoon and distributed sweets to all of them. It was a small ceremony and the manager handed over the key to me. A few pictures from delivery day are shared below. Ownership Experience Likes : 1.Smooth CVT gearbox : I am a sedate driver, and the CVT exactly suits my driving style. There is no considerable rubber band effect. Overtaking can be done without engaging sport mode. I hardly use sport mode. I have never used ""L"" mode yet. I have travelled through hilly areas of Kerala. Magnite can easily handle the hilly areas with in ""D"" mode itself. 2. 360 degree camera : This is my favourite feature of Magnite. It is commendable for Nissan to include a 360 degree camera in a budget product. Parking has become much easier. The camera quality is not that great at night, but it does the job. 3. Isofix mounting point for Child Seat 4. Sufficient leg space for rear passengers 5. Charging points and AC vents for rear passengers. 6. Cruise control : A very useful feature on highways. Could not use this feature on the roads of Kerala. But used in NH of Tamilnadu and Karnataka . Mileage figures will cross 20+ if cruise control is set in the range of 80km-90km Improvement Areas 1. Armrest design : The arm rest could have been a little longer. For Nissan micra, the arm rest was longer and it was suitable for my seating position. 2. No storage space under the arm rest. This started bugging me after driving my friend's Kiger. 3. Poor graphics of the meter console compared to Kiger. 4. Limited number of service centers. This will be a problem if you are planning to go on a long trip. When I was purchasing the car, Nissan did not have a service center in my hometown (Kannur). Currently, they have a service center in Kannur. However, compared to other brands, the number of service centers is very limited. Periodic Service and Dealership Experience I bought the car from EVM Nissan, Nettoor and I have done all my periodic services at the same dealership. The dealership experience was satisfactory. But there is no ""wow"" factor or ""delight"" experience. Service advisors were very helpful. Since I took the Gold Pack and 5 year warranty at the time of purchase, I did not have to pay any amount till 50000 km apart from brake pad which was replaced during 40000km. Other than that all PMS were done in free of cost. Gold pack was valid until 50000km. 60000km and 70000km of service put together came to around Rs. 12000, which included consumable items and oil changes. Maintenance costs are reasonable. I suggest anyone who is considering Magnite purchase Gold Pack and Extended Warranty. I wanted to extend Gold pack, but there was no option to extend it beyond 50000km. I used to get a mileage of 13km - 15km in the city and 17km to 21km in the highway. If you are using cruise control, mileage will be around 22km-24km. Issues / Repairs 1. Driver side window one-touch auto-close/open was not working. They have replaced the motor under warranty and rectified the issue. This was during 30000km service. 2. ""Check Anti-Pollution System"" Error : This was the one that had caused me a lot of problems to me. In March 2022, I was planning to go on a trip from Cochin to Raichur via Kannur. The journey will be around 2000km to and fro. So before starting the trip, I had gone to EVM Nissan, Nettor for a general check-up as I did not want to have any niggles during the trip. They have inspected the car and I have collected the car back on the same day evening. The next day I started the trip around 7 am from Cochin, just after an hour of driving, ""Check Anti-Pollution System"" error started showing in the meter console. I had called the service advisor and shared the photo with him. He was not very sure of the reason for this error. He requested that I get the car back to Cochin for Inspection. I drove back to Cochin and dropped the car off at the dealership. It took them an hour to give the car back to me. They did not find any issues. The service advisor was saying it could be due to some loose connection, and this error usually indicates some water content in the exhaust . But they could not find any issue in the exhaust either. However, since the error was cleared, I have started my journey again. I was travelling via Kannur, and when I reached Ponnani, the same error started displaying again. I had called the service advisor again and he was clueless. He was saying that since it is not related to the engine, this won't be a problem for driving the car. But I was not convinced to go ahead as I will be travelling with my family and never want to get stranded in an unknown place. A nearby service center was in Malappuram district and it was owned by the same dealer ship, EVM Nissan. I reached the dealership around 5 PM and have explained all the details to service advisor. But he was saying that they would be able to check the car only the next day. Since I have to start travelling to Raichur next day early in the morning from Kannur, requested him again. I connected with a service advisor at EVM Nissan, Nettoor and they both had a conversation. Finally, he agreed to check the car. They completed the inspection and refixing the sensor wires solved the issue for the time being. But they were also not able to identify the root cause. I drove the car to Kannur and started early in the morning from Kannur to Raichur. By the time I reached the Karnataka border, the error had started displaying again. There was no other option, hence I have proceeded with the trip. I did not face any issues while driving, but the error was displayed on the screen. I gave the car back to EVM Nettoor once I reached Cochin. They have replaced the sensor assembly and the error has been resolved. It was during 30000km. Since then I have not encountered this error. 3. Right side DRL had become yellowish colour. Service center had suggested replacing the DRL. Cost was around 5000. So I have not replaced it yet. It ison hold as of now. 4. Another Car Rear-Ended : This happened at a traffic signal and one Alto rear-ended my car. Alto did not stop and flew away. There were some damages to the boot. Entire repair was covered under insurance. That experience of claiming insurance/ getting the GD entry from Police Station will be posted in a different thread later. 5. Glove box lock broken: This happened around 67000km. Glove box door got opened when I accidently passed through pot hole. I was not able to close the glove box and found that the lock was broken. I had to replace the glove box assembly and it cost around Rs. 4000. Apart from above, I have not had to undergo any repairs until now. Currently, car has completed around 74000 km. Tyre Changes / Accessories / Future Plans Stock tyres were replaced after completing 40000km. Stock tyres were CEAT. I replaced it with Continental UC6 and it costed me around 30000. There was a considerable change in the high-speed stability of the car after the tyre replacement. Wiper blades were replaced with Bosch. I have purchased 3D mats and Sun shades from Nissan. Sun shades are useful, but it would have been great if they had provided UV-cut glass windows by default. I am planning to de-chrome the car completely and also to repaint the alloys black colour. Will update the progress. -------------------- Few photos are shared below 1. Late to office. Did not get a parking spot.. 2. Very early to office. No one in the parking lot.. 3.

428, HYDRAVI , 13:08 ,BHPian,I am another satisfed Nissan Magnite Owner. I bought CVT Turbo SV version in March 23 based on cost advantages since show room price was below 10 lakhs and hence tax advantages and on road price was 11.41 lakhs. Very good car and Very goood service so far. Headlights and seats are better in SV Premium of course. Excellent drivability. Best automatic.Intially I was getting 9kmpl in city . It improved to 10 now after driving 5k kms. I was told it will improve further as I drive more. In highway certainly it gave more than 13kmpl. I did not adjust my natural fun loving driving style to get more FE.

I liked it except for the weird noise while braking at slow speeds. The interior quality was so-so, I didn't like the feel very much. But nevertheless, the VFM proposition of Magnite is unmatched. The salesperson discussed the pricing and offers after the TD and showed me the official mail from Nissan regarding the price hike starting in August. I was disheartened as I was planning to take it by August end. Also, Red color CVT variant wasn't available readily. What further disheartened me was the salesperson saying that the price won't be frozen after the hike is announced, even if I make the booking now.

She then finally gave her verdict in a one-liner ""Wo feel nahi aayi is gaadi me"" (I didn't get that feel). I asked her what kind of feeling she was expecting, to which she said ""Magnite andar se baithne me premium nahi lagi utni"" (Magnite doesn't feel premium from inside).

She looked quite satisfied with the experience and said to me ""Nexon lagti hai feel wali gaadi, bahar andar dono se"" (Nexon feels like a great car both inside and outside). Now that she is fixed on to Nexon AMT, my Magnite CVT dream is broken :( . Magnite CVT was the only proper automatic car in my budget 11-12 OTR, but now we'll soon be booking Nexon AMT at a dealership near our place, because waiting for the Nexon facelift would be futile, as there is no hint about its launch dates (most probably it will be launched after December) and prices will further increase by then. Moreover, the DCA Nexon will definitely be around 13-15 OTR. With this price hike, it would be difficult for Magnite to retain the most VFM Sub 4 m SUV tag.

440, NagarjunaB , 15:46 ,Newbie,"I noticed that certain driving styles can get good FE/Mileage on CVT. If you are already aware, please ignore, just sharing info. It looks like CVTs hate acceleration(could be the same with manual too, but it looks like its worst with CVTs, my Access 125 bike behaves the same). The less time you spend pressing further down the accelerator the more FE/Mileage you are going to get. You can do either of below 1. Keep pressing down the accelerator linearly (don't want to put too much pressure on the engine/transmission) until you reach desired speed. Once you reach the desired speed, hold the accelerator where it is now to maintain constant speed. 2. Instead of holding the accelerator at certain level(as mentioned in #1), keep releasing and pressing the accelerator every now and then. You don't want to release the accelerator for too long, otherwise the speed of vehicle will drop very much and the burden to get up to the desired speed will be on the accelerating phase. I see this driving style in bus drivers. I guess what I am describing above is nothing new and is just what is known as non-aggressive driving style.

Updates/adjustments/observations so far:Fixed some minor rattling issues in the doors myself - * It was caused by the morons at the dealership ripping apart the plastic vapour barrier inside the doors like it didn't matter when installing the tech pack speaker upgrades. These torn vapour barriers vibrate when you have certain kind of uneven roads creating a weird plastic-sheet-vibrating sound. A separate minor rattling exists on the front right window near the A-pillar/ORVM-panel somewhere, will check it out and fix it myself when I have some time with the car (hopefully sometime next month) Recently got a proper upgrade on the sound quality - for free. Finally used that option called ""loudness"" in the audio settings - after ignoring it forever thinking its some stupid volume boost thingy - it wasnt. Its a major upgrade for the quality of sound. Bass is much more pronounced now (I use +4, 0, -2 for bass, mid and treble levels) to get a slightly bass-heavy sound. Music now sounds much fuller and a world better than before. I will install some dampening on the doors soon (I hope) and that should further improve the sound.

451, NS13 , 13:00 ,Newbie,"Hello BHPians, This is technically my first official post 😍 So, I got my hands on the New Nissan Magnite on 09/08/2023 and here's the opinion that I have formed in 30 days of driving it. N.B. - Model - Magnite XV turbo MT Colour - vivid blue and storm white Location - Kolkata Average daily drive - 20 kms. (Mostly congested) * My views are mostly based on my previous driving experience of driving Tatas and Mahindras for the last 15 years (and Marutis and Hyundais prior to that). Buying Experience: I 'd been driving a Tata Bolt XM revotron since 2015 and was considering a change and an upgrade for sometime. Come July 2023 and I made up my mind to finally execute the plan. Being a Tata loyalist my first choice was the Nexon (petrol) followed by the Nissan Magnite and the Maruti fronx. Tata Nexon - The tata showroom was my first visit and I was almost 50% inclined towards the Nexon. My budget allowed me the XM (S) version and I was kind of okay with compromising on the frills. However there were two dissuading factors for not proceeding with the Nexon. One, a very close friend already had the new Nexon (xz plus, BS6 ) and was utterly dissapointed with a mileage of 8.5 km/l even after owning it for over a year with 10k on the odo (I can vouch for the poor mileage of petrol Tata Cars having had two petrol Tata cars previously). Second, the exchange deal on my existing Tata Bolt was not worth a second negotiation, thus, ending my dream of owning the Nexon. Maruti Fronx - This was the third option on my list. And to be honest I am no fan of MSIL. Saying so, I must say that the Fronx is pretty. It's quite the looker and I was seriously considering the Fronx at this point. However my pocket was only deep enough to get hold of the Delta Plus 1.2 L model. It drove well, nice interiors, fairly well loaded with features however, what irks me is that MSIL cuts corners by not adding bare essentials like a rear parking camera or rear wiper on a car that has an ex showroom tag of 9 lakhs. However, I was willing to overlook these minor gripes. The only reason that prevented me from buying the Fronx after 2 test drives was the pick up of the car. May I dare say it was sluggish. Nissan Magnite - The second option on my list. 3 showroom visits, 2 test drives later the Magnite seemed the perfect fit for my requirements. My family (especially, mum) loved the looks of the car. It was a turbo charged petrol engine (which I was used to in the Tata Bolt), had adequate frills, sun/moon roof was never a criteria. Yes, I have a weakness for the turbo charged petrol motor. The showroom experience was okish. They were a little pushy, unwilling to negotiate at first. However, owing to a connection at Nissan India, I was able to pull a few strings and garner a fair discount on the car and also, the underbody anti rust rubber coating. After completing the loan formalities (seamlessly), I was finally called for delivery on 09/08/2023. The delivery experience was a 7.5 out of 10. ** I had sold my Tata bolt via OLX (advert not OLX auto) in the meanwhile. The Pros: 1. IMO the car looks quite nice to be honest. 2. Adequate gadgets and frills. 3. Peppy engine (has enough grunt when needed). 4. Personally I love the diamond cut alloy wheels on the magnite. 5. The android auto and apple car play works seamlessly. 6. The sound of the engine is pleasing to the ears. 7. The 6 speaker sound system is quite good (although the harman kardon on my bolt was better). 8. The ground clearance in commendable, have recently Waded through the water logged streets of Elgin Road effortlessly (the ones who stay in South Kolkata know what I mean) 9. Quite spacious. 10. Service centers seem quite responsive for now. 11. Ac is good 12. Comfortable seats The Cons: 1. Headlamps - The halogen headlamps are not upto the mark. Need to learn from the Tatas and Mahindras. 2. Suspension - Hard suspension. You can feel the thud over large potholes which are aplenty in Kolkata. Again Tatas and Mahindras are brilliant when it comes to suspension for the Indian terrains. 3. I am not a big fan of steel sheet fuel lids (they start rusing eventually) 4. Clutch has a pretty deep play. 5. Long gear throws. 6. Ac or blower vents missing for the rear passengers. Now most importantly, the mileage; To be honest I have only been following the MID on my car. And After having driven about 900 odd kms I am getting a mileage of 9.2km/l (my regular drive is generally on a very congested stretch), however I firmly believe this will get better post the first couple of service. Unfortunately, I haven't had the opportunity to take it out on a proper long drive on the highway to ascertain its highway mileage or engine capabilities. I do intend to do so soon.

Given that the car is still selling 2000+ units in India every month despite being the only model with limited engine options shows that the car has somewhat garnered renewed hope in the Nissan brand (in India) therefore, this ICC event is it's best chance to get couple of new cars in the market including an EV and perhaps a proper SUV. I feel Nissan India is missing a trick here. If at some point Nissan decides to kill the Magnite to bring along new launches I believe that could prove fatal for them. Nissan should really learn a trick or two from Tata, Mahindra and MSIL in the way in which they are capturing the automotive market by having a product for everyone and then having an extra niche product. Having seen Nissan in the European market I wonder why Nissan is unable to launch newer better cars in India.

It was a special car for our family as it was the very first brand new car my parents ever owned. It was in this car that both my brother and I learned to drive, and it witnessed countless memorable journeys with friends and family. In fact, back in 2003, it proudly became the first facelifted Wagon R in our town. I bid farewell to the Wagon R in 2006 after my graduation, as I moved to different cities in search of job opportunities, eventually settling in Bangalore. I purchased my own car in 2012, a gen2 Swift ZDI. In 2017, I moved to the USA and asked my parents if they were interested in selling the Wagon R and keeping the Swift. However, given their comfort with the Wagon R's tallboy design, ease of ingress and egress, and low maintenance, they chose to keep it and let go of the Swift. Years passed, and the Wagon R underwent its 15-year RTO testing, approaching its 20th year milestone in October 2023, having covered about 100,000 kilometers during its remarkable 20-year journey. Meanwhile, our family had grown, and our new car requirements had evolved. The primary need was for my brother's wifeys daily hospital commute for job and occasional travel for my elderly parents. Thus, an automatic transmission was essential, reducing our dependency on drivers. We also needed a car that offered easy ingress and egress for our parents and was user-friendly for city driving. Since we already had a Seltos for long journeys, we didn't require a large car. Our search for a new car began in July, and I was particularly drawn to the Magnite due to its availability with a CVT transmission. In the small car segment, automatic gearboxes often consist of AMTs, but after testing a few, we decided against them. We expect covering approximately 40 km in our daily usage. A slightly larger car was our preference, and the Kiger and Magnite emerged as our top two choices. We began our search in July while I was in my hometown for a vacation. Other contenders in our search included: 1. Citroen C3- The Citroen C3 was the sole vehicle on my radar when it came to finding a replacement. Ever since I learned about the Citroen Magic Carpet technology, I've held the hope that it would indeed become the perfect successor to the wagoner.Automatic transmission wasn't a consideration at that time.Eventually, automatic transmission became a necessary requirement, and the absence of updates on this front from Citroen was a key factor in our decision to reconsider the choice. Additionally, the absence of a Citroen sales and service center in my town played a significant role in my decision-making process. While I wasn't overly concerned about resale value or minor issues with the C3, it would have unquestionably been my top choice if it had an automatic transmission option. 2. Maruti Fronx - my brother expressed interest in this car. However, the lower height of the back seat made me think it somewhat challenging for our parents to get in and out. Despite attempts to arrange a test drive, the Nexa dealership displayed a lackadaisical attitude, and the lower exchange value for our Wagon R (considering the same brand) was a concern. We wanted to test it at home to see if our parents could comfortably enter and exit. My reservations included the high cost of the top variant automatic, which was around 15 lakhs on-road. I was hesitant to pay such a premium for a car with an unknown safety rating. Despite its attractive design and a trusted service network, we decided to explore other brands. 3. Tata Nexon - While I initially had a keen interest in the Nexon, the buzz about an upcoming facelift made me reconsider. Furthermore, concerns about the AMT gearbox and some less-than-favorable reviews regarding Tata's service quality were additional factors in my decision to rule it out. 4. We didn't give serious consideration to Hyundai and Kia options, as we already had one of their cars in our family. 5. Kiger - Regarding the Kiger, I didn't delve into the details extensively. This was primarily due to its comparatively lower sales numbers than the Magnite. Many reviews pointed out slightly cramped rear seating, and for some reason, I found the Magnite's design more appealing than the Kiger's. 6. My brother expressed interest in the Baleno or Glanza, but we realized that these models wouldn't align with our parents' specific needs and preferences. So, we ultimately settled on the Magnite as our choice. Selected XV Premium CVT Turbo variant with 5 years extended warranty package. I had knowledge about the vibration problems and a few rattling issues based on the reviews on Team-BHP. The next stage of our journey was to secure a favorable deal. I began by checking prices in Thiruvananthapuram city, where I was residing at the time, while my brother obtained a price list from a different dealer in our hometown. We had two choices to consider, and we opted for the top variant, with our preferred color being black. Initially, we received a higher quote from Pinnacle Nissan in Kollam, my hometown. However, I managed to secure a better deal in Thiruvananthapuram and initiated negotiations with the other dealer. Eventually, we obtained a competitive exchange price, which included all corporate and exchange bonuses for our Wagon R. When we presented this offer to Pinnacle, they identified some discrepancies in the other quote. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that the disparities were indeed valid. As a result, we decided to go with Pinnacle in Kollam. My brother had a test drive from their showroom, and they even brought the test drive vehicle to our home to see if it suited our parents. They generously allowed an extensive test drive for my brother and his wife, left us impressed with the car. We placed the advance booking amount on the same day, and they initiated the sale procedures. Moreover, they graciously permitted us to continue using the Wagon R for a few more days. Some farewell pics of the WagonR. Then, we received news of a price change from Nissan, which initially came from the Thiruvananthapuram dealer. The sales executive forwarded me a screenshot of an email from their higher-ups, advising SEs to finalize the deal before the price increase took effect. We received a similar message from Pinnacle as well, and this all unfolded around the end of July. In response, we decided to contribute 40% of the total cost from our end and planned to finance the remaining amount through a loan. We promptly had the loan approved and transferred the money, along with handing over a cheque based on the current price. We also requested an email confirmation ensuring that the price change would not impact our agreement. The following day, we received confirmation that the car had been allocated and dispatched from the factory. Upon returning to the USA after my vacation, I found that the car had arrived at the dealership's lot on August 6th. I entrusted my brother and a close friend with the task of conducting a Pre-Delivery Inspection. One disappointing aspect we encountered was that the car had 24 kilometers on the odometer. When we questioned the Sales Executive about it, they attempted to justify it by stating that the vehicle had undergone testing at the factory on a test track . Interestingly, we also noticed another CVT turbo model with only 5 kilometers on the odometer, but there was no clear explanation provided when we inquired about this discrepancy. It's apparent that the car may have been utilized for test drives or perhaps for employee transportation, given the mileage on the odometer. Rather than engaging in a prolonged argument, we decided to move forward with the next steps. Some pictures from the Pre-Delivery Inspection. Speaking of my friend, his passion for automobiles is truly remarkable. He serves as a regional sales manager, which entails extensive travel throughout the state. Notably, he is an avid car enthusiast, boasting a collection of multiple vehicles and even engaging in a joint venture related to car resale. Among all the cars he owns, his absolute favorite is the VW Vento Highline, which he acquired back in 2012. As of my writing this, it has covered an impressive 280,000 kilometers. What's truly remarkable is that he hasn't had to replace the clutch yet, a testament to both his exceptional driving skills and deep knowledge of the subject matter. This car is still going strong, a testament to its durability and his impeccable care. I suggested him consider getting Karlsson leather seats based on reviews from TeamBHP. And I'm pleased to report that the seats are still performing exceptionally well. Some pics of the Vento Completed all the necessary paperwork on next day and provided them with the green light to proceed with registration process. We secure an auspicious delivery date of 8/25. Furthermore, it worked out perfectly since my brother had a break from work during that particular week. Fortunately, the dealership was accommodating and agreed to store the car in their parking lot until we could pick it up. To keep us updated, the Sales Executive sent a screenshot of the mileage displayed on the odometer after completing registration On the much-anticipated D-Day of 8/25, everything seemed aligned with the auspicious time as per the astrological calendar. However, what we hadn't anticipated was the unforeseen road construction activity that significantly dampened our delivery experience. The PWD initiated a substantial excavation right in front of the showroom, precisely where the post-delivery exit ramp had been placed. This unexpected development added a layer of complexity to our delivery plans. According to the SE, this excavation had occurred just the day before, and they claimed to be completely unaware of the situation. However, this explanation seemed highly improbable since construction work is typically not carried out during night time hours. To our surprise, we had received no prior updates or notifications from the dealership about this, and we only became aware of it when we arrived for the scheduled delivery. Due to the unexpected excavation, we were left with no choice but to have the car delivered on the side of the road adjacent to the excavation site. It was a less than ideal situation, but we had to adapt to the circumstances. We proceeded and received the keys on schedule, although it was a far cry from the so-called Nissan delivery experience we had hoped for. Our sincere gratitude goes out to the Kerala PWD for their unexpected contribution to this unique delivery story! Putting that aside, the car proved to be the perfect replacement for our family's requirements. It has served as both a self-driven vehicle and an occasionally chauffeur-driven one. While the initial mileage figures didn't quite match some of the reviews, we are optimistic that it will improve as we become more accustomed to the CVT usage. We plan to keep this car until our next upgrade to an electric model , and hope for a trouble-free experience throughout. Some photos from the 3M treatment. After reading reviews on Team-BHP regarding rusting issues with Dusters and exhaust pipe rusting problems with Magnites, we've made the decision to opt for underbody treatment and exhaust pipe anti-rust coating after taking delivery.

I am going to get my engine oil change (along with oil filter, air filter) done during my 10k km service (which I will get earlier at 8000km as you suggested.

491, optimystic01 , 20:20 ,Newbie,"Hello Everyone! I purchased a Nissan Magnite CVT (Auto) towards the end of May 2023. As of today(19 Jan '24) it has clocked 6700 kms on the odo. I went to the nearest official Nissan service centre for wheel alignment and balancing on the advice of a friend who suggested that its good have this done every 5000 kms since the roads in Bangalore roads are in bad condition. Turns out it was not necessary. During the visual inspection, I was informed by the service agent today that the brake pads are worn out and need replacement. He also mentioned that if the pads are not replaced immediately, the discs will also wear out and will need replacement. I was shocked that the brake pads of Magnite need to be replaced so early. When I expressed my dissatisfaction to the advisor, he mentioned two things: 1. The brake pads of the CVT do wear out faster than the manual. 2. Perhaps I was braking a lot. For #1, I would request other Magnite CVT owners if they have had to replace their brake pads within 7K which still seems very early For#2, my counter will be this: I have owned a Maruti Alto, Maruti Baleno and Ford Fiesta earlier. I have never had to replace the pads so early. The minimum I have clocked for a replacement has been 20,000 kms. I escalated this matter to the Nissan customer care.

I test drove the car yesterday and it seemed decent to me. I am not well versed with this segment and i have mostly driven manuals so i won't comment on the car/drive nuances. Things i am not liking: There is only 1 car of my23 available (coincidentally in white which my BIL wants) Onroad is 13.64 and they are offering a discount of 95k bringing it down to 12.69. Is this a good offer? Biggest red flag for me right now is; Car is may 23 *billed* as per the SA. Why will a May billed car still be available till Jan? Is it normal for Nissan? During discussion they stated warranty starts from May23 as the car is already billed to them(so we loose almost 8 months of warranty) and they are offering+3 extended warranty but that will also be till May. I queried as per my knowledge, the warranty should start when i purchase it and not when it was billed to you. His answered that the discount we're offered is being given in the first place since it's already a billed car. Today he messages my BIL and says that the car is unbilled one and warranty starts from when we buy it. Utter confusion or we are being played. Should we go ahead with the car, push for more discounts? I read almost the entire thread yesterday and it seems to me to forgo the 95k discount and go for my24 car. But my BIL is impatient types. He like the nexon too but can't wait 3 months for a car. My 15 days old niece will be using this car to travel so i wanted max safety, but unfortunately kushaq and the likes are not fitting in his budget.

He quoted Rs. 21,000 (21 Thousand) For headlight replacement? That's grossly expensive! What are they making the headlight out of? Gold? It's actually true. For a new Magnite LED headlight, one unit costs 21000. The DRL is 7000 rupees. when you open the engine bay I can see there is a tool we can twist just behind the headlamp which is actually moving the bulb of headlight back and forth. This actually helped me reset the bulb to go inside the holder well. But the bulb has to stick to the holder to not fall again outside of it when I go on rough speedbumps. But the catch here is that when the bulb is tightly attached to the holder, it is aligned exactly to the center of the road not to slightly left as it's the left headlight. So I had to twist the right headlight as well to center instead of slightly right. So my headlights are shining towards completely center. Which is ok considering the high cost. Not getting any issue during night drive now. Having said this. Can you help me here a bit? Can you switch on your cars headlights and click a photo of headlight bulb at an angle 90 degrees to the actual beam. I mean to click a photo perpendicular to the outgoing beam. Just to see how your bulb is setup on your car.", 23rd January 2024,Hyderabad,9,10,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

505, SS-Traveller , 14:46 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Our neighbour, also a close friend, is bothered by the unreliability of his non-turbo Magnite. Registered in February 2023, the car lit up its dashboard lights like a Christmas tree, the first time in August 2023, and again in early January. The first time around, the Nissan service centre (Youwe Nissan at Okhla, New Delhi) returned the car after resetting the error, and no other action. In January, they cleaned the injectors, reset the error and returned the car, without pinpointing why the problem happened. The friend travel outstation as well as drives long distances for work, and he is now terrified that the car will give up on him without notice. Both times that this error happened, the car went into limp mode first, and later refused to start, leaving him stranded - and he had to call in a flatbed truck to transport the car to the service centre. The following is the body of his email to customercare.nissan@email.nissan.in dated 9th January 2024: Quote: The Customer Service Team, Greetings, I am writing this mail with great dissatisfaction and shock due to extreme issues I have been facing with the car. I bought a Nissan Magnite with great expectation and excitement considering the big brand name. I bought the car last year in February 2023 and hoped for a hassle-free and stress-free driving experience, But to my shock I started facing problems within the span of 6 to 7 months of buying the car. On 30th August 2023 all of a sudden the car stopped working by showing all caution and warning lights, due to which my family faced great issues, especially my father as I bought the car for him. The car had to be sent for maintenance and thinking it to be a one-time issue I let it pass by and got my hopes high again when the car was returned back after the maintenance. But it seems like either there is some problem or manufacturing issue with the car or the maintenance done on the car was not conducted properly because to my disbelief the same issue of all the caution and warning light appearing happened again last week (05th January 2024). My father, who is a senior citizen, was coming back from his work and the car started giving problems midway home. It has made our life very difficult as we are unable to use the car and my father is unable to attend his work. It has also put a fear of constantly worrying about the car which can stop working anywhere. Such kind of issues are not expected from a newly bought car from such a big brand name. Facing the same issues again and again in a short span of time has put a lot of stress on me and my family. I’m writing this complaint on a serious note as when a customer purchases a car he/she expects it to drive hassle free and hope for the company to give good service for many years. It is totally unacceptable that a car from such a big brand name keeps giving issues rendering the car unusable. Taking the car to maintenance after everytime we face this issue is not a solution nor I am looking forward to facing these issues again as it keeps the safety of my family in doubt. I request you to kindly look into the matter and give a solution as I am done with it. Looking forward to timely and correct actions. Thank you What is happening here? Anyone has any idea how this problem can be permanently resolved? Whom should he write to at Nissan, to take care of this?

Theres a constant rattling sound from around the AC vents on the dashboard. I started experiencing it from almost a week after I got it. I sent it to Surya Nissan Bangalore and then to EVM, Kottayam and all they seem to do is stick a load of insulation tapes inside and send it back. But this is a temperature fix. The rattling starts again in a few days. Im sure there are others who have experienced it. Does anyone know solution to this? Is there any dashboard damping kinda thing that can be done? 2. The power windows dont work unless the engine is on. This is annoying sometimes. Is there any fix to this? Am i doing something wrong? 3. I drive between Bangalore and Kochi at least once every month and that makes up most of my driving. Is there any good neck-rest that you recommend specifically for the car?
