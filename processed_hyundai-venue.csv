0, suhaas307 , 11:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Hyundai Venue N Line Review Hyundai Venue N Line Pros • Aggressive styling and distinctive touches set it apart from the regular Venue • Punchy 1.0L turbo-petrol motor with 118 BHP mated to a fast shifting dual-clutch AT • Firm yet compliant suspension coupled with weighted steering + paddle shifters + fruity exhaust note that make the Venue N Line a fun little package • Tasteful N Line-exclusive touches such as the N Line steering wheel, gear selector, drive-mode selector, red accents etc liven up the otherwise drab interior • Feature-rich equipment list includes 4-way electrically adjustable driver’s seat, auto-dimming IRVM, cabin air purifier, BlueLink telematics, Home to car (H2C) with Alexa / Google Voice assistant, voice-activated sunroof, wireless charging & more • Price premium over the regular Venue is totally justified by the additions & improvements • Safety kit = ESP, 6 airbags, rear disc brakes, Blue Link SOS, Hill Assist, factory-fitted dual camera dash-cam… • Hyundai's wide & competent after-sales network Hyundai Venue N Line Cons • More of a warmed-up compact crossover than a proper hot crossover • 1.0L DCT variant shows initial lag. Even otherwise, it’s not as explosive as VW’s 1.0 TSI • Handling is not as confidence-inspiring as one would expect from a ""hot"" crossover. Tyre upgrade is mandatory! The OEM rubber gives up easily • Diminutive street presence. Looks more hatchback than SUV from some angles, especially the rear • Strictly a 4-seater; the rear bench has very awkward seating for the middle occupant • No manual transmission even as an option! • Long term reliability of the DCT is a concern • Missing kit (auto wipers, steering reach adjustment...) Introduction Of all the car manufacturers in India, Hyundai was the last company that anyone expected to cater to the niche and minuscule enthusiast market in India. Yet, in the span of 1 year, Hyundai has launched not one, but two ""N"" inspired cars with a few more on the horizon. We say ""inspired"", because these N Line variants are not the full-fat double-cream ""N"" variants that have steadily gained popularity in the international markets, particularly in the European Union. That said, the Indian domestic market is clearly maturing enough for companies to consider introducing niche products that cater to an extremely exclusive segment. Hyundai’s ""N"" division is now more decorated than ever before. With inputs from its WRC program and having poached BMW M Division’s head honcho, Hyundai is evidently serious about its N Division. For more dope on Hyundai’s ""N"" division, we urge you to read our i20 N Line review published around this time last year. The Venue N Line, strangely, isn’t the first hot/warm compact crossover to hit the shelves. Enthusiasts may remember Fiat's Avventura Abarth, which was essentially a Punto Abarth on stilts. Enthusiasts may also remember Ford's attempt at a fun compact crossover, a la the EcoSport S powered by their famous EcoBoost 1.0 3-pot turbocharged engine mated to a 6-speed manual transmission, along with 'S' specific trinkets. Hyundai, however, would be hoping that the Venue N Line has a far greater impact on the market than the Avventura Abarth or the Ford EcoSport S, as only a handful of these warmed-up compact crossovers are found prowling the streets today. While such cars are gaining popularity and widespread notoriety in other markets, fast crossovers are still in their nascent stage in India and their scope for success may prove to be boundless. The idea of a souped-up compact crossover is a fantastic one considering the poor and sometimes non-existent roads in the country, not to mention the numerous hillocks that masquerade as speed breakers. Hyundai Venue N Line Price & Brochure The N Line is available in 2 variants - N6 and N8 priced at Rs. 12.16 lakh and Rs. 13.15 lakh (ex-showroom, India), respectively. The dual-tone versions cost Rs. 15,000 more. We feel, compared to the equivalent variants of the standard Venue or even other sub 4-m SUVs, these prices are quite competitive considering what the N Line offers. You can download the 2022 Hyundai Venue N Line brochure here - Hyundai Venue N Line Brochure. Exterior The N Line variants of the Venue have been applied to the facelifted version of the Venue. Much like its hatchback sibling, Hyundai has gone to town with the lashes of red all over the Venue N Line's bodywork. While to some, it may look good and suits the ethos of the N branding, it may come across as a tad shouty and overdone to others. The massive, borderline-grotesque chrome grille up front does not help matters either as it looks hopelessly disproportionate and comical given the overall size and footprint of the entire car. That apart, the Venue is a smart-looking car, especially in its facelifted guise with its sharper lines, squared-off stance and new tail-light assembly that extends across the width of the rear boot. N Line-exclusive touches include N Line badges on the front grille, side flanks and boot lid, N Line alloy wheels and, of course, the signature double-barrel exhaust tips peeking out from under the rear skid plate. The Venue N Line comes in two single-tone colours - Polar White and Shadow Grey and three dual-tone colours - Thunder Blue with Phantom Black roof, Shadow Grey with Phantom Black roof and Polar White with Phantom Black roof. The new colour option called Shadow Grey is similar to the famous Nardo Greys and Chalk/Crayon Hues from European sports car manufacturers and not too different from the Steel Grey option of the erstwhile Skoda Octavia vRS 230, Hyundai’s new Shadow Grey is a real head-turner! Interior Much like the i20 N Line, the Venue N Line gets the same ol’ drab-ish grey and black plasticky interior but peppered with red accents like the red piping and red-chequered flag motif embossed on the black upholstery. The dashboard gets red ambient lighting and the sunroof helps alleviate some of the drab vibes by bathing the cabin in light. However, the real standout features are the fabulous N steering wheel with paddles and the N gear selector nicked from the i20N available in international markets. The Venue N Line also gets a rotary drive mode selector located behind the gear selector which allows you to switch between three driving modes – Normal, Eco and Sport. Interestingly, the i20 N Line does not get this rotary drive mode selector and we are not sure why? In terms of space and general accommodation, the Venue N Line is no different from the regular Venue. The front seats are fairly snug, offering adequate lateral and under-thigh support. Three adults on the rear seat will be a squeeze, though acceptable for short journeys. The rear bench does recline just a little bit, making longer journeys a less cumbersome affair. The boot is large enough for a weekend getaway, and the rear bench benefits from a split-folding option, allowing good flexibility while transporting larger objects.", 19th September 2022,hyundai-venue,Bangalore,"8,828","12,241",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
1, suhaas307 , 11:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Driving the Hyundai Venue N Line DCT 1.0 T-GDI engine could have done with a little more poke. Hyundai tells us that the engine is already close to its limit and headroom for tuning is severely limited: Fire up the familiar 1.0L 3-pot T-GDI motor and you are greeted by a distinct burble from the twin exhaust pipes. However, this exhaust note is not intrusive and can be drowned out by music or the A/C blower, if turned up. Hyundai mentioned that the Venue N Lines exhaust note is a smidge louder than the i20 N Lines and we agree with them. Select ""Normal"" on the drive mode rotary selector, slot the DCT gearbox in ""D"", ease off the brakes, and the Venue N Line creeps forward albeit without the urgency one may expect from a torque converter-equipped automatic car. The burbly note from the exhaust continues as the DCT seamlessly works its way up to the higher gears. The tiny 1.0 T-GDI motor coupled with the DCT gearbox makes light work of city traffic while treating you to the muted thrum from the exhaust. Select ""Eco"" on the drive mode rotary selector and the blue graphics on the instrument cluster turn green. The gearbox now hurries its way up through the gears with the intention to extract maximum fuel efficiency from the motor. The exhaust note gets a touch quieter as the car finds itself in the 5th, 6th and 7th ratios with minimal effort. It must be said that the drive mode selector exerts no influence on the exhaust note, which only quietens down as the DCT cycles to the higher rations and the revs drop to a relaxed 1,300 rpm. Kickdown response in Normal and Eco modes is slow as the gearbox takes a second or two to sort itself out before handing you the power. As we made our way to the open road, the opportunity to explore ""Sport"" mode presented itself to us. Knocking the selector into Sport changed the green graphics in the instrument cluster to red, and all it took is one harmless prod on the loud pedal to wake up the drivetrain. The DCT promptly dropped a few gears and suddenly, we found ourselves in the meat of the powerband. Part throttle application is all that was needed to hustle the car to triple-digit speeds and the fruity exhaust note only egged us on even more! The gearbox, in Sport mode, is not as seamless as it is in Normal or Eco modes. Hyundai appears to have tweaked the gearbox to deliver a very mild yet deliberate jolt as the transmission holds onto lower gears and only upshifts much later in the rev-range, ensuring that the 1.0 T-GDI keeps delivering the goods. Shedding speed in Sport mode will influence the gearbox to drop a gear or two, to ensure that the engine is kept on the boil and the strong mid-range is available to the driver. Kickdown in Sport mode is discernibly quicker than in Normal or Eco drive modes, but not nearly as quick as one might expect. Paddles behind the steering wheel allow you to take control of the gear changes - the left paddle allows you to drop a gear while the right paddle sends the transmission to the higher one. It must be said that the paddles are an absolute joy to use, and credit must go to their form factor and tactility. However, sustained punishment via the paddles is clearly not appreciated. The gearbox refused to downshift through the paddles after about 20 minutes of wringing the car by its neck. Calm driving for a couple of minutes allowed the gearbox to cool off and permitted the resumption of paddle-shift shenanigans. While Sport mode is fun and the engine does not hesitate to deliver its power in the mid-range, several chinks in the Venue N Lines armour will surface when you are done playing with the gearbox and decide to rev it up to the redline (6,000 rpm). Above 4,000 rpm is when the exhaust note is somewhat drowned out by the coarse 3-cylinder engines thrum, and at around 4500 rpm is where you can feel the cars power dropping off a little. Go above 5,000 rpm and the 3-cylinder motor makes its presence felt in more ways than just the thrum, as the cars power appears to completely drop off. This 1.0 T-GDI motor does not enjoy being wrung to its limits and is most happy delivering its power between 2,000 and 4,000 rpm. Even the gearbox, in Sport mode, tends to upshift well before the revs creep to the redline. While there may not be any real drama or push-back-into-the-seat feeling from this 1.0 T-GDI motor, there is no doubt that the Venue N Line is a competent expressway cruiser that delivers power in a linear and fuss-free fashion. In city limits, the Venue N Line is an absolute hoot to drive especially in Sport mode, as the gearbox downshifts frequently and the muted yet snarly exhaust note bounces off the walls and flyover ramps. Its a great point-and-shoot tool that takes little-to-no effort whatsoever to put a smile on your face. We thoroughly enjoyed blipping the throttle and dropping gears while navigating city streets and often found ourselves playing with the throttle and paddles just to listen to the exhaust note. With that out of the way, it must be said that Hyundai has missed a trick or two while developing its N Line variants. We feel Hyundai could have done more to make the Venue N Line even more entertaining. A factory ECU tweak for a little more power or snappier gearshifts would have been welcome as this engine is mechanically no different from the one found in the Turbo variant of the Venue. We certainly think the N Line deserves a mild power bump to truly distinguish it from the regular Venue. And while the DCT is a great transmission, a manual option should have been offered for those who like to do the work themselves. Suspension The biggest compliment we can pay to the Venue N Line is that its suspension and steering are very un-Hyundai-like! The suspension particularly appears to be tweaked to deliver a sense of firmness that simply isnt characteristic of Hyundais. It is clear that Hyundai has fiddled with the shocks' valving in order to achieve the firmer damping and rebound actions, and it is more than just perceivable. This firmness is immediately observed while negotiating ruts and undulations on city roads. But this firmness does not make the ride uncomfortable as such, and only communicates the road surface to the cars occupants without tossing them around. The firm suspension is almost dismissive of ruts and undulations even at three-digit speeds. On the open road, the Venue N Line feels quite settled at high speeds. It can feel a bit twitchy while switching lanes at speed, but that is due to the cars compact crossover ground clearance and perhaps, the short wheelbase. It is not as settled as its European counterparts, but its certainly an improvement over the regular Venue. However, much like the drivetrain, chinks in the Venue N Line's armour will surface when the car is pushed hard. Body roll, although controlled to a degree, becomes pretty obvious. Again, this could be down to the added ground clearance and the extremely average MRF Wanderer Eco tyres. The steering is not feather-light and dead off-centre as most of us may have come to expect from Hyundais generally. There is some heft & weight to the EPS, even at lower speeds. The steering isnt exactly sharp, but its accurate enough to keep you interested. However, the weighted steering simply does not inspire confidence while pushing the car around tight corners as it feels completely disconnected. The brakes on the other hand are as good as they can get for a car of this size. All-round disc brakes will bring the Venue N Line to a stop fairly quickly and if it werent for the MRF tyres, the braking performance might have felt even more sure-footed. The brake pedal is sharp and takes a little getting used to, but once youve got the hang of it you wouldnt be short on confidence when emergency braking becomes necessary. Hyundai has done a decent job in calibrating the steering and suspension to deliver a sporty experience. However, we cant help but feel that the changes are merely surface-level at best. Make no mistake, the Venue N Line is not a true ""N"" product and therefore, expectations must be tempered accordingly. The incremental changes the N Line variant brings with it, serve the intended purpose  provide the ""N"" flavour without the added calories and sugar. In that respect, the Venue N Line meets the objective.", 19th September 2022,hyundai-venue,Bangalore,"8,828","12,241",Interior/Instrument Panel/Material Quality (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Yes, it is largely cosmetic, but there are perceptible changes to the steering, brakes, suspension and exhaust that add a lot of value to a casual enthusiast or someone looking for a fun car with practicality. The dash cam no doubt is a great addition, but I think we must take a step back and acknowledge that a company like Hyundai is at least trying to cater to a niche market while other companies like Maruti are just slapping stickers onto Swifts and calling them limited edition models. During the i20 N-Line drive last year, we asked Hyundai if they would be open to offering the extra parts as optional extras for existing i20 Turbo customers and they clearly mentioned that such offerings will be subject to ARAI approvals and its a huge headache.

It would be really hard to choose between the two. The Kushaqs 1.0 TSI is a far superior engine without a doubt. It revs and makes power all the way to redline, but the Venue N-Line sort of plateaus after 4-4.5K RPM. Also the Kushaq is a better built product comparatively. So if the engine is really important to you and build quality too, the Kushaq is the way to go. But if you dont mind a slightly inferior engine and build quality, the N Line offers a lot for the money relatively of course. Its a more fun package thanks to the weighted steering, firmer suspension, fruiter exhaust and paddle shifters on the wheel. I too prefer the i20 N Line but somehow the Venue N Line proves to be a greater overall package thanks to the added ground clearance.

A perfect balance for a city car- small size, nice ride, boot space, drivability and features 3. SUVish so ground clearance is no worry. Venue is nice car to replace any premium hatch and yet provide much move over and above that I would not buy this for: 1. DCT gear box 2. Cost for that puny presence 3.

However, you can go with a straight pipe exhaust with a valvetronic muffler for a good exhaust note. Honestly, I would never recommend a valvetronic muffler unless it's from a reputed brand that has put in the time and R&D to develop the product. Generic valvetronic mufflers use the valve/flap and actuators that tend to fail prematurely. And when they are closed, the backpressure is immense, and you will risk doing some serious damage in the long run. You will also lose power with the valve closed as a result of the immense backpressure. Also, if you have closely examined a generic / universal muffler, you will notice that it is nothing but a perforated straight pipe with glass wool packed up around the pipe and the muffler body designed around it. The glass wool will burn away with time and it will essentially become a straight pipe. I am not sure about others, but personally, a generic muffler makes the exhaust note sound a bit cheap and brash. The lack of a polished and tuned note is extremely obvious, and to me not appealing at all. Compare this to a stock exhaust muffler - stock mufflers do not have a perforated straight pipe running through them. A cross section of a stock muffler would reveal several chambers and baffles and channels through which exhaust gasses flow. It has been designed and engineered with a lot of thought and science. The Venue N Line's muffler is quite similar to a stock exhaust. The difference perhaps could be fewer baffles, larger channels and acoustically tweaked chambers. The basic construction remains the same. This is exactly why I would always recommend purchasing exhausts from reputed aftermarket exhaust companies such as Milltek, Akrapovic, etc. While these exhausts are eye-wateringly expensive, you can be rest assured that you will get a finely tuned and developed product that does not merely make a lot of noise but instead makes the right sounds.

Thug dealers, reliability concerns and a DQ200 DSG that will almost certainly fail once or twice in a 10-year ownership period. 100% without doubt, the Kushaq with the 1.5 TSI and DSG will be a lot faster and potentially more fun too. But the issues I see (apart from the obvious reliability concerns) are: 1) The Kushaq 1.5 TSI DSG is a whole 5 lakh or so more than the Venue N Line, and that could be a deal breaker for most. The 1.0 TSI is far closer to the Venue N Line in terms of pricing. 2) The Kushaq lacks the drama that the Venue N-Line has in spades. The tighter suspension + steering and the fruity exhaust note, not to mention the paddle shifts. The Venue N Line has character and personality than the Kushaq somewhat lacks. Maybe it's time for Skoda to consider locally engineering vRS versions of the Kushaq, with paddles on the steering wheel and a tuned exhaust.

Also, since both are mated to Turbo-petrol engines, overall as a package, which car would be more reliable in the long-run? Only time will tell if the DCT in the Hyundais are better than VAG DSGs in terms of reliability. At the moment, we have not observed a pattern as we did with VAG DSG. At least Hyundai provides you with a warning notification on the instrument cluster when the DCT begins acting up and also provide a disclaimer regarding the DCT - stating that the driver will need to stop the car and allow the gearbox to cool down before proceeding. VAG it appears like to surprise their customers with sudden failures and without any warnings whatsoever. The only way to verify the health of the clutch-pack is to hook up the car to a computer via VCDS and examine the parameters and values closely. Speaking of reliability on Hyundais generally, there have been reports of Hyundai's T-GDI motor's fuel pump failing prematurely.

Well, it does sail over ruts and expansion joints with ease, there is a muted thud and the suspension keeps you extremely aware of the road surface. It does not isolate you from the surface and I think that is what you are looking for in a car. It certainly won’t last the sustained punishment of rut riddled roads, most cars wouldn’t to be honest.

33, skyfire2892 , 15:31 ,BHPian,"1 month with Venue N line It's been almost a month since I took delivery of my Polar White dual tone Venue N line. Sharing initial ownership review Buying Experience I was strictly looking for automatic car owing to traffic situation in Bangalore. I would have preferred a sedan but market for these has really shrunk. Had looked at Baleno and i20 but given sloppy state of roads, decided to go for a compact SUV. I test drove Venue, Kiger, Sonet and Nexon. Nexon had AMT which I didn't like. I was completely sold on Kiger's design but it's interior, sound system and camera are different story altogether. Remained Venue and Sonet, Kia made this decision easy as Sonet AT had waiting period of 1 year :| I also liked rear design of new Venue, so we booked Phantom Black Venue DCT, since that color really complemented the LED strip at rear. Our waiting period was ~4 months, and ~2 months later Venue N line was launched. While we were fixated on exterior black color, which N line didn't have, it's black + red accent interior swayed us, plus amount of features added(4 disc brakes, auto dimming IRVM ) were really enticing. We ended up switching our booking to Polar White with black roof. Bonus was ~1 month was shaved off from waiting period We got the car from Trident Hyundai, Whitefield and whole experience was quite good. Ownership Experience I'm fond of car's look and exhaust sound. The car is a looker and I've seen this on roads too with people turning heads. Driving is pretty smooth, steering is a bit heavy than normal Venue which is a plus point. We have a Creta Diesel at home, so I feel quite comfortable driving this car as well. Sports mode makes driving very responsive and that's what i use on open roads. Eco mode is something I avoid as car feels dead. Suspension feels fine to me, was a bit worried given this variant has a bit of stiff suspension but I'm not feeling much difference till now. City FE is ~10 kmpl with bumper to bumper BLR traffic. Did one highway drive and saw trip FE reach 17-18 kmpl. Black and red interiors look good. In car entertainment system is quite smooth as well. Bluelink is a hit and miss. It allows me to do some settings remotely, view car status but its car location feature is not real time. If car is in basement where signals are limited, bluelink will not be able to fetch it and it doesn't even store location of car when it had signal access previously. Dashcam is decent and has an app to retrieve data(you have to be in car to do that). Auto headlights and ORVM with puddle lamps which open as you approach the gate are very welcome features. What I don't like Lack of wireless android auto which is available in lower variant. I would have swapped this feature with Bluelink if option was provided since I don't use those features that much. Lack of back illumination of driver door buttons. Only window roll down button is illuminated, quite inconvenient when going to malls etc and have to unlock car for boot.

37, DriftDevil , 18:26 ,Newbie,"Hi fellow Team BHPians, firstly big thanks to TBHP admins for allowing me to be a part of the group (after trying twice before in last 7 years). I recently became an owner of a shadow grey Venue N Line N8. Brief facts: Booked on: 26th Oct 2022 Delivered on: 28th Nov 2022 Dealer: Pavan Hyundai (Electronic City, Bangalore) Rides owned: Ford Fiesta 2008, Ford Figo 2012 Tdci (first car), Ford Freestyle 2020 P T+, Hyundai Venue N Line N8 2022 (Current ride) Reasons to shift from Ford to Hyundai: Sadly Ford has left India, and though there would not have been much issues to procure service and parts, but putting mind over heart I had to move out from Ford. Vehicles in contention: 1. Xuv 300 W8 (O) Turbo - Was keen on this but lack of a proper automatic and the compromised bootspace (family of 5, frequebt road trips) 2. Nexon XZA+ (P) - Again lack of proper automatic 3. Brezza ZXI+ TC - lack of power, somehow did not connect with the drive and feel, interiors though improved still lack the premium appeal 4. Venue N Line N8 - loved the auto transmission, for sure one of the best. Interiors felt premium, drive and feel was quite satisfying, plus add to it the sporty appeal. Sealed the deal for me. My experience so far: Have driven around 800kms and the drive has been a pleasure, dct is butter smooth and a hoot to drive, went of few highway drives and the ride & handling have been exceptional (unlike other hyundais) add to it the mileage has been exceptional (17-19km/L). Fell in love with the colour (not a day went by when i have not looked back and just gazed in awe of it). Ask me if anyone has any queries!

No hard revs, i let it increase gradually and no rev launches at traffic signals 2. light foot as they say, always pressing the A pedal gradually and keeping a constant distance from the front car 3. Let the car idle first time when you start, let the revs settle at around 0.8/0.9 never drive immediately on a cold start hope these help!

I have seen multiple reviews on Youtube but I feel ownership experience can give a lot more details about a car so please share any other suggestions even pictures will be helpful. Big big congrats on your upcoming car mate. My reccos: Warranty  Take Hyundai Shield of Trust. I Got it at 9k I think Accessories: 1. Horn  it is more than okay. Has a nice tone. Dont bother replacing. Anyway loud horns are for uncivilised and uneducated roadies, not for sophisticated drivers. In india, as a practice, we shall honk less as 99% of times I observe its highly unnecessary. 2. Tyres  even I thought of replacing the stock MRF wanderers as there are more comfort oriented ones like Michelins or Bridgestone in the market, given this vehicle has a slightly stiffer suspension But I decided against it as MRF seems not to bad but theyre average at best. People recommend selling them off right from showroom to get the best price out of stock ones. (To know which tyres: check my profile > posts by me > someone recommended me tyres on Sonet thread) Im kinda 7/10 satisfied with these tyres and I do have a back issue (at least used to have but now okay  had slipped disk) So Sonet also has slightly stiffer suspension compared to normal Venue, guessing itll be on par with N Line when it comes to stiffness  so few owners opt for comfort oriented ones. 3. Side Step  would totally recommend specially when youre in a city like bangalore. Not for climbing on vehicle but to safeguard your vehicle against hooligans bikers / autos trying to overtake all the time and brushing against your vehicle is a pleasure to them. To save your bottom of door part. Gives protection against few other things on road as well I have been meaning to search something which is minimal one (for protection) and has least textual branding. The original one has big Venue written all over it and it seems pretty unclassy. Or rather any accessory which writes the car name looks very ugly and cheap. Im also looking for aftermarket side step which looks subtle and nothing that should spoil the look of an already sophisticated looking car. Will let you know in case I find anything. 4. Other accessories one can opt for garnish for fenders and light area and all, but trust me, vehicle looks best without any of cheap stuff on it, be it original accessory or aftermarket. Do you see many luxury car owners sticking stuff on their vehiclesno, right? Car is lovely at its naked best tbh. Rather invest this money in a good ceramic coat. Will totally recommend it. Try to get it on day 1 and speak to Detailers beforehand 5. Headlights  few people complain about lights as well, specially on highways but I think its not needed. Above average for sure. I think many delhi roadies are pretty much into high beams all the time and they want throw of light such it puts sun to shame In short, not needed unless you really feel so after a couple of night drives on highways. Add ons : 1. They shall give you full body bucket mats for sure and maybe car cover also. But mats for sure. Mats are really nice. 2. Dont expect much discounts but try your best. 3. So the dead foot pedal is uncovered from mats and the fabric is exposed. I think when you put your muddy footwear on that fabric, its gonna absorb it and is obviously not very easy to clean. So look for solutions for that. Maybe a small Vinyl sheet which can protect that area and on top of that put your original Hyundai bucket mat. In short, 1. Side step  strong yes, given its kinda minimal and doesnt take away the beauty 2. Shield of Trust 3. Ceramic coat  please get it done but not from dealer. 4. Headlights (only if you yourself feel its necessary) 5. Tyres  only if you think its necessary and your driving connoisseur experience tells you that youd make out the difference.

66, coolboy007 , 13:05 ,Senior - BHPian," Got my N8 Shadow grey Venue 20 days back, have already completed a trip to Himachal and done with 1700 kms together with first service. This car replaces our Baleno CVT which had done just 18000 kms but i was fed up with the poor return to center action on the steering and numerous rattles. The only contenders were Sonet and Venue, Venue won because of the stiffer dampers, rear discs, better exhaust note and the lovely Shadow Grey shade. Upgraded the stock audio with Blam components, Sony XM GS4 4 channel amplifier, Infinity sub and damped all 4 doors and boot. Also swapped the crappy MRF's for Yokohama Blu earth in stock size. What's good - Coming from a Maruti, the heft of doors, NVH, interior quality and the switchgear is a level above. - The turbo petrol engine is fun when you are in the mood for it, can effortlessly cruise at 110-120 all day with the 7 ratios available. - The handling was a pleasant surprise for me, we have a new gen Creta at home too but this car handled the ghats effortlessly, rides absolutely F-L-A-T on expressways. - 4 disc set up is very confidence inspiring, a big step up for me coming from a Baleno. I also have a 330i and the braking is just a notch below that car which is commendable. - I have changed to Yokos so for me the tyre noise is well controlled and the ride has become cushier. Suspension works silently for the most part. - AC performance is excellent, miss the UV cut glass which was there in Baleno though. - Gear changes are butter smooth and seamless, kick down takes atleast a second to kick in. - Front seats get A+ for long drives, drove solo 11 hours from Himachal to Delhi with no pain or discomfort noticed during the drive or next day. - Excellent service by the dealers - casually called at 11 am to book the first service on a saturday and they promptly picked up the car within 2 hours, just paid 2000 for underbody coating. - Company fitted dash cam, just wish they develop an app to copy videos directly to my phone. - The ICE touch screen has lovely graphics and very fluid to use without any lag. What's not good - Steering has more heft than normal but is devoid of any feel or feedback. - With stock audio, the doors made an irritating noise with bass heavy songs, read online that this is common with Venue. - This engine+gearbox combo loves to gulp fuel, returns 10-11 in city and 14-16 on expressways, my 330i with more than twice the power returns same FE. - You can feel some vibrations at idle as its a 3 cylinder engine - The DCT is tuned for FE as it keeps upshifting in comfort mode, had to use paddles in ghats as the engine went out of its turbo zone multiple times due to this behaviour. - Seat ventilation is a big big miss, should have been there. - Rear seat space is a bit tight, missing rear armrest on newer models now. - LED head lights are weak, way better than Creta but still average. Issue - I dont know if anyone has noticed this but the lowest part of front windshield has a sort of concave/convex view and this gets very irritating in the hills, not noticeable in city, need to check if our Creta has the same issue.

76, clementj , 21:14 ,BHPian,"We took delivery of a new Venue N Line N6 in Shadow Grey last month in Chennai. We have done about 900 kms in the car so far and the experience has been very good. The Venue N Line N8 has already been comprehensively reviewed here and so I will try focus on our buying decision and a little bit on how the N6 compares over the N8. This car is technically a replacement for my wife's 2018 Grand i10 Automatic I have to admit that it was very difficult to find a replacement for the Grand i10 as it was perfect in many ways. A refined 4 cylinder engine with a smooth and reliable torque converter AT, quality interiors that never really aged, a cohesive design that still looks modern, spacious and practical for a family and the perfect city car that will get you around in a stress-free manner. In the right senses, I would have kept the Grand i10 but then not all decisions are sensible and logical. While it was practical and convenient, it was a slow and boring point A to point B car that I was itching to replace. We had had it for 5+ years and the used car market offers were good with an offer at 70% of its original price in our hand. Once we had made the decision to replace the Grand i10, we roughly agreed on what we would look for in the replacement. Our priorities were: a) City friendly footprint b) Automatic ~ no AMTs c) Fun factor with usable performance d) Good fit and finish e) 12L-20L budget We spent more than 2 months evaluating multiple options but no other car tugged the heart strings and made sense to the head equally as much as the Venue N Line. Our considerations Maruti Suzuki Fronx 1.0 AT - On paper it made super sense. Boosterjet engine with a reliable torque converter, spacious, very well equipped and backed by the famed Maruti Network. We pre-booked the car but cancelled the booking once the prices were out. Volkswagen Taigun/Skoda Kushaq 1.0TSI AT - Best driver's cars in this price range period. The 1.0 TSI engines were more than competent and both these cars were a hoot to drive. The build quality wasn't great for VAG cars though. It was a difficult decision to go for the Venue vs one of these cars but perception of reliability, previous Hyundai ownership experience and lower price tilted the decision. Renault Kiger/Nissan Magnite 1.0 CVT - Both these cars were great value for money and the Turbo+CVT combination was fantastic. The cars however clearly felt built to a price with too many areas and hinges exposed and the TD cars showed their age very early. Kia Sonet 1.0 DCT and 1.5 AT - The Kia Sonet certainly has a lot going for it and my wife loved the way it looked and how well equipped it was. But for me, while both the 1.0 and 1.5 engines were entertaining enough, it did not drive as well as the N Line twins. Hyundai i20 N Line - The i20 N Line was also a good fit and we felt that it handled better than the Venue but the higher driving position and ground clearance of the Venue found favour with my wife. Hyundai Venue N Line - This was the car we finally went ahead with for multiple reasons. Smart looks, Competent dynamics, Quality interiors with great fit and finish, Unique Shadow Grey exterior shade, City friendly nature, a Smooth DCT and a value oriented price point (N6). Trim level: N6 or N8? When Hyundai launched the Venue N Line, the N6 variant came only with 2 airbags and missed out on features such as electrically adjustable seats, dual dash-cam, HD infotainment with connected tech, reclining rear seat with arm rest. From a safety point of view alone, a lot of buyers would have skipped the N6. In isolation, it was a very well equipped variant nonetheless with everything you’d practically need and want. Over time, Hyundai had added curtain airbags to the N6 as well as reclining rear seats making it even more sensible. The N6 also came with the added convenience of wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay which the Hyundai’s with connected car tech miss out on. As the car was the 3rd in the family and was going to be used primarily in the city, the extra features weren’t really going to make a difference. Plus the fact that we have hardly ever found use for the famed connected car tech on 2022 GLA 220d made it easy for us to go for the N6 variant. Buying experience Choosing a colour wasn’t very difficult as it was only between a Thunder blue or Shadow Grey and we were OK with both. We had originally taken a test drive with Kun Hyundai in Chennai but they did not have any N Line’s in stock and we were quoted a waiting period of 1-3 months for the N6 variant. It was by chance that I checked with V3 Hyundai, the dealer where we had earlier purchased our Grand i10 and we were in luck. They had one N6 Shadow Grey Venue in stock and they were willing to offer a discount on it. The car was manufactured a month earlier and the dealer was happy to let me check the car out in their yard. From the quoted price of 15.47L OTR, we agreed on a final on-road price of 14.82L ~ around 65k. I also opted for a Graphene coat and Garware 70 film from the dealer as the price was competitive (~40k). We had the car registered and delivered in 5 days with the necessary work done. In addition to the floor mats and flaps, the dealer included a N Line brand pack on delivery which included a set of seatbelt shoulder pads, a cap, a t-shirt, a sweat shirt and a hot/cold insulated cup - all N Line branded. Overall, the experience was good and kudos to Hyundai for the consistency that they are able to maintain when it comes to their dealerships and service centres. What I like Entertaining and easy to drive- the 1.0 turbo + DCT combination makes it a fun car to drive in the city or on the motorway especially in the sport mode. And the high driving position, ground clearance and small turning radius make it very easy to drive. The Shadow Grey Colour - The Venue is a really common car on Indian roads but that colour makes this Venue N Line really rare especially in conservative Chennai. Good or bad, it turns heads! Wireless Android Auto/Apple CarPlay - This is one convenience that I really appreciate in the car. I have a personal Android phone that uses a type C connector but also happen to carry an old company issued iPhone 11 that requires the lightning connector. With wireless support, I can switch to my iPhone to attend a teams meeting and switch back to my Android phone by just toggling a button on the touch screen. In the GLA or the Compass, I have to carry 2 sets of cables to be able to do this. The Interior - Hyundai cars are always a step above other manufacturers when it comes to interior quality. The Venue is no different and we love the feel of the N Line steering and shifter and the quality of the switchgear all around. What I don’t like Fuel Efficiency - The turbo petrol engine is very sensitive to driving patterns and traffic conditions. In bad and heavy traffic conditions, the car barely manages 6-7 kmpl but in light traffic conditions when driven with a light foot in the eco-mode, it returns 12+ kmpl. On an average, we have managed 7.5 kmpl average in the city due to bad traffic conditions due to extensive metro rail and storm water drain works which is a significant 25-30% lower than our GLA or Compass (diesels). Turbo Lag - When the drive mode is set to Normal or Eco, the turbo lag is pronounced in lower revs and needs some getting used to. Overall, the experience has been very good for the most part. The ride quality hasn’t really suffered from the suspension changes and the steering is sufficiently communicative. While the competition offers more equipment and/or more spacious cabins, the Venue N Line scores higher on quality, function and desirability and its a car that we’ll continue to look forward to drive for years to come.

I need to hear the heart beat of my love while driving, else I don’t feel connected – with 3 cylinder engine – I could have some of this - partially – miss you Oil Burners Some background – I consider my father who is in his early 60’s still a die-hard driving fan – countless trips to North India hill stations + 5 trips to Badrinath, Kedarnath – that too in our beloved Carburetor wali 800, Old Zen and Daewoo Cielo. Recently took him on drive to Jaipur via Mumbai Expressway and it was a blast for him. For the first time he drove an Auto and I keep reminding him to rest his left foot. Pre-covid – I used to do solo DEL-Pune trip every 6 months with overnight stay in Indore in my Brezza. So its been 4 years that I haven’t planned a 1000+ km trip. And here we all had 2nd Oct extended weekend and my Second Love is calling. Why Mount Abu ? I believe this is the only Hill Station in the state of Rajasthan and having done N number of trips to Shimla, Nainital, Mussoorie, Kullu Manali – Itch was to explore this as well and compare. Best part is this place is around 750 km from Gurgaon – which I am comfortable covering in 1 day. Planning – my car is just 6000 on the ODO – so just a tank full and basic checks. Random 3 star hotel booked online for 2 nights – since this was more of a solo driving trip – not looking for any luxury The D Day – Finished Friday night early and fired engine at 5:30 in the morning. Trust me – the exhaust sounded so good in the silent parking lot. (got a sheer feeling of Paisa Wasool for N Line). Started following Google Map – since Hyundai in-built navigation is shady – followed old Delhi Jaipur route since it was early morning and Google Baba showed very less traffic. This is one highway that I personally have been driving since almost last 25 years and its still in bad shape (multiple constructions, bad road conditions) however there are hell number of fancy and big eateries till Jaipur. Once you cross Jaipur towards Ajmer / Pali – there are only basic Dhabas – where you can fairly see Truck drivers + general public – all eating in one place. Drove towards Ajmer bypass – Pali road – Jodhpur bypass and then Mount Abu. Finally reached Abu by 4:30 PM – checked inn – While returning back on 2 Oct – I started again by 5:30 AM – reached Gurgaon by 3 – was able to stretch “N Line” till Ajmer however from Jaipur – Delhi, it was flooded with NCR cars returning back - and then let pictures do the talking Couple of points / Observations: 1. Coming from Brezza – N Line felt much more sorted while cornering 2. Never order any fancy dish in a remote dhaba – stick to basics like dal, vegetable, roti/rice. You wont find “Tandoori” rotis / dishes in local low scale dhabas – they only serve Tawa dishes. 3. Rajasthan police is nasty – I have a long-time experience with these guys – I tend to keep 10% above the speed limit and just keep driving – but stretched legs on some long runs where I was sure of no cops 😊 4. Mount Abu is very near Gujarat border – in fact it’s a mini-Gujarat + lots of Boose – Everyone speaks Gujarati there – even Beggers. People who have been to Himachal, UK – please don’t even compare. (by the time you start seeing Hair Pin turns – road ends ☹ 5. Shop owners / Hotels wont bargain – Booze is sold 5-10% above MRP – they are spoiled – thanks to Gujarat (no offence to anyone please) In fact most of the big eateries are owned by Gujarati’s only and they only accept Cash payments – No card / UPI (all their menu prices are inclusive of GST) 6. Delhi to Jaipur – fairly heavy traffic, Jaipur to Kishangarh – less traffic, Ajmer to Jodhpur and further – very less traffic. 7. Always follow the local state news where you are travelling – Rajasthan fuel stations were closed for couple of days recently and were only left with limited stock – so it was a rationing system after Pali – no-one was ready to do a full tank – so had to fill up “Hazar Ka” 3 times ☹ In fact there is only 1 fuel station in main town of Abu which is near the main attraction “Nakki Lake” – it was completely jam packed and caused a km long queue on weekend with big GJ cars piling up. 8. Except the old Delhi Jaipur road – rest of the highway is fantastic – hardly any broken patches 9. All fuel stations accepted UPI – refrain paying via card. 10. Tourist places will spot outstation cars and will ask for parking money – without any valid ticket – don’t get into arguments – not worth it – just pay and move on – they are local goons 11. With my Second Love – got around 11 kmpl on highway round trip – while in city I get around 15 – “another wife – another animal” Specially while alone ", 4th October 2023,hyundai-venue,Delhi,172,162,Transmission,Very Positive

81, jaibatrik , 14:07 ,Newbie,"Initial impressions of my Hyundai Venue N Line N6 Hello, respected fellow forum members 👋! I am a long time follower of this forum, but I only got my membership approved in the recent months. The content on this forum has always quenched my curiosity, broadened my knowledge, and helped me in making my own decisions better. So, here I am to share my own perspective to help those who come here after me 🙏 Background I was driving a 2014 Hyundai Eon Magna+ that I purchased in 2017 for almost 5 years when the itch to upgrade caught me. My friends were always urging me to take a safer car, and I too wanted a car that would be suitable for highway, not just the city. At the same time, I was going through some trouble elsewhere in life, and kept postponing the upgrade. But, as it would turn out, the situation dragged, and I finally decided to not let go of the joy of owning a new car by other things and bit the bullet! A photo of my beloved Eon below. Hunt for a new car I was somewhat clear about the requirements. I wanted the car to have the following features. 1. It should be proper automatic (no AMT / iMT). 2. It should have a decent infotainment system with Android Auto. 3. There should be automatic climate control. 4. There should be a reverse camera. 5. The car should accelerate well and handle well - but these were not deal-breakers - I do love cars, and enjoy driving, but I am a sedate driver most of the time, and have fun pushing the car only on few occasions. 6. It should not be a sedan (I know the sedans are preferred for their superior handling and aerodynamic shape, but I live in a city and I value compactness way more than handling). With the above clear criteria, and a budget less than 15 lacs, only two cars caught my fancy - the Kia Sonet and the Hyundai Venue. I wasn't too interested in Kiger / Magnite as they weren't from the OEMs with bigger footprints. Further, I didn't like the styling of the new Venue, and the variant that came below 15 lacs didn't have climate control, alloy wheels, etc. So, I did a few test drives with the Kia Sonet, found nothing wrong with the car (I already liked it), and booked the HTX DCT variant in August, 2022. They contacted me in December saying the car was ready, but there was another crisis that I was dealing with at that time, and passed on the opportunity to purchase. Finally, the storms were over, and I was ready to get the car in May, 2023. I contacted Kia showroom where I booked the car, but the prices got increased by more than 60k, and I was in dilemma again. And during one of these days, I came across the Venue N Line news on TBHP and enquired about it at the nearby Hyundai dealership. The price was around 50k more than Sonet HTX, but I was ready if there was value in that. Test drive, booking, and delivery I took a test drive of the car, and really liked it. I felt the seating position was better than the Sonet, and the visibility of the road was definitely better. I liked the handling and the planted feel of the car, and the sports mode (which was easily accessible in Venue) literally put a smile on my face. I ended up booking the car at the dealership. They promised delivery in 3 months, but I visited another dealership afterwards, and they had one shadow grey N6 arriving that day itself that they could deliver me in the interest of month end. I did a PDI the next day armed with the TBHP checklist, and everything seemed okay. I got the delivery of the car the next day. The journey so far, and my impressions I have completed close to 4500 kilometers with the grey beauty till date, and have been thoroughly loving it. I haven't taken her to all the terrains yet, so this review is based on where we've gone so far - office runs, in and around Hyderabad (Shamshabad, Shamirpet, Yadagirigutta, Vikarabad, etc. through ORR) and one recent trip to Bangalore, Mysore, and Bandipura through NH 44, and Bengaluru - Mysuru Expressway. Here's what I think of different aspects (at least the ones that matter to me) of the car. Engine The drivability is good once you are in the power band. You can overtake most of the vehicles on the road without much effort. I have done speeds (slightly) exceeding 120 kmph and didn't feel the engine was strained. The power, at lower RPMs, comes as a sudden surge though - which I feel is very inconvenient when you are at a crawling speed, and want to cover a limited distance quickly. The car might even feel out of control for someone unsuspecting. Overall, quite happy with the performance though. Gearbox The DCT gearbox is quite nice, by the virtue of being butter smooth. On plains, or downhill slopes, you cannot feel the gear shifts at all. The default tuning of the gearbox is conservative though, and upshifts are quite quick. Mind that the gearbox, in conjunction with the engine, can serve you power when you need it - by going to the power band / turbo range, and holding the gear. There's turbo lag though, and you're better off using the paddle shifters to stay in the power band when the window of opportunity to overtake is limited. Suspension Probably the best quality of this car that I like. I feel that this is tuned perfectly for our roads. The ride quality is not stiff, and be it lower speed or higher, the car absorbs the undulations of the road in such a composed manner. Even at higher speed, the car stays composed when tackling sudden big potholes. I haven't driven the best handling cars, but this certainly satisfies the driving enthusiast in me. The body roll seems to be contained, and I am able to take corners with sufficient speed. Steering The steering also feels precise enough to guide the car precisely to where I want it to point to. This, along with the suspension, makes driving quite interesting in my opinion. However, I am not fully satisfied with the steering also. I find the steering to be unnecessarily heavy, and it's more pronounced at lower speed. The steering is so heavy that I used to get shoulder pain after long city driving. Exterior Not a big fan of the grill, but I like the overall styling of the Venue N Line. I do think that the car looks beautiful and I look back often at her after locking and going away. Interior We know that Hyundai does a good job here, and this is no exception. I didn't expect anything more at this price point. The cabin feels so premium, and the ergonomics are so sorted. Seats Coming from the Eon, I used to feel that the seats are hard, and they are indeed firm, but nothing that you cannot endure. The front seats are a nice place to be and they hold you in place even when you take corners at slightly higher speeds 😀 Visibility Great, nothing to complain here. You even get to see the bonnet! Driving modes I'm a huge fan of this feature. You get three modes - Eco, Normal, and Sport; and the driving dynamics (at least power delivery) changes completely depending on the mode. In Eco mode, the power comes very linearly, and I feel the turbo doesn't kick in perhaps? I use it in heavy traffic when all I can do is to match the speed of the traffic. The Sport mode delivers more power even from lower RPMs and acceleration is quite quicker. I generally don't use it as this drinks too much fuel, and the power delivery becomes very spiky for city conditions. I use it on twisted roads when I'm in the mood for some fun. I use the Normal mode for all other cases, which satisfies all general conditions. Infotainment system The 8"" touchscreen is nice and responsive, and for most part, the wireless Android Auto works pretty well. What I'm not satisfied with is the sound quality of the unknown audio system. I'm not an audiophile, yet neither the lower or the higher or any frequency for that matter sound nice to me in this car. Even my Eon had better sounding speakers. NVH I feel this is decent for the price. The engine is smooth for the most part, and the cabin is quiet enough to filter out the road noise while allowing some of those exhaust pops in. The journey overall feels relaxing and I don't feel tired even after longer journeys. Fuel economy I don't know whether to be happy or sad about it. Coming from an Eon, the trips to fuel stations have increased manifold. Although, I understand that the fuel economy I'm getting, between 8 to 12 in slow traffic, 14 to 16 in smooth city traffic, and 16 to 20 on highways, is decent for this engine. A few photos ... And that's probably it! Please reach out to me if you are looking for any particular information / opinion, and I'd be glad to help you on your new car selection journey!

83, vijayendra16 , 19:11 ,Newbie,"Hi Ashdel, I recently bought OTTOCAST CarPlay wireless adapter in my new Venue N line N8 and have just used it about 2-3 times on city rounds. I found it good so far though I felt that the phone heated up a little bit. It got stuck once but unplugged and plugging back helped. I find it useful as I on't have to connect my phone. Will be doing a Goa trip shortly so planning to use it all the way to test it on long drives. Will update the results post that. For now, it seems worth it if plugging your phone every time is tedious. I got it for 7k on Amazon post some discounts.

85, _ajk_ , 10:57 ,Newbie,"Hi All, This is my first post on here and super excited to seek the help from fellow bhpians. I am planning to buy a new car for me, It will be my first car but we have 2 cars in our family and I have driven both of them a lot. I have made sure that I wanted to buy an automatic but not an AMT or an iMT. Hence My choice was reduced to DCTs and TCs and my budget was around 12 lakhs OTR. But soon I realized no cars with proper automatics are available in that price bracket. While researching, I stumbled upon Hyundai Venue S(O) DCT which is 13.4 Lakh on road in my city. This variant is decently loaded with feature which I am looking for. Hence I have almost finalized this. I have made a booking of this model and meanwhile continue doing research on this engine and gearbox combo. As this would be our first petrol car in family, all other cars are diesels only. I am specially worried about the DCT gearbox, I am hearing a lot about heating issues with DCT gearbox and their reliability, is this gearbox that bad or it can be manageable with proper care?", 18th December 2023,hyundai-venue,Pune,11,23,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Positive

If you are willing to spend up to 13.5 lakhs OTR for an automatic car, you do have quite a few options, they being: 1. Tata Altroz XZA Plus (S) The Altroz is one of the safest automatic cars (5-star GNCAP) you can get in this budget and you get in a 6-speed wet-clutch DCA with a planetary gear system, it is much more reliable than a dry-clutch DCT too. However, power (87bhp) and torque (115 nm) are not as high as the Venue DCT (118 bhp and 172 nm) but safety, features, and comfort are top-notch. The top-of-the-line XZA Plus (S) comes with all the features you need and costs under 11.78 lakhs OTR, to add to that you get up to a 30k cash discount as well (depending upon the variant). It's an excellent choice to consider if you are looking for a safe car with space, practicality, and features, and are not thirsty for performance. 2. Honda Amaze VX CVT The Amaze is the best sub-4-metre sedan you can get and the top-of-the-line VX CVT is decently equipped and offers a 1.2 L Petrol engine producing 89 bhp of power and 110 nm of torque, the car is safe (4-star GNCAP), has enough space, a large boot and is one of the most reliable cars in this budget. At under 11.40 lakhs OTR and with over Rs 67K Benefits (Including Rs 25K Cash + Rs 15K Exchange Bonus + Corporate and loyalty), if you are after a sub-4-metre sedan, the Amaze is the way to go. If you want a little more flair, the Elite Edition at just over 17k extra offers visible changes on its exterior including an Elite Edition badge, boot spoiler with built-in LED, front fender garnish, and anti-fog film on ORVMs, features such as TPMS, front armrest with a sliding function, tyre inflator, and Elite Edition-specific seat covers and illuminated scuff plates. 3. Hyundai i20 Sportz IVT The i20 Sportz IVT is a decently equipped car which is spacious and practical, the car offers adequate performance (87 bhp of power and 115 nm of torque) with a smooth IVT, at just 11 lakhs OTR and along with over 20k discounts, the i20 Sportz IVT is a car worth considering. 4. Nissan Magnite Turbo CVT If you are looking for a safe (4-star GNCAP), powerful (99 bhp of power and 152 nm of torque) and feature-loaded SUV, the Nissan Magnite might just be the best pick under 12 lakhs OTR, beginning with the XV Turbo CVT ( at 11.78 lakhs OTR) till the XV Premium (O) Turbo CVT (at 12.99 lakhs OTR), the Magnite is a worthy contender, and with over Rs 90,000 Benefits (Rs 25K Cash + 2 Year AMC Maintenance + Rs 40K Exchange Bonus + Rs 10K Corporate Discount + Finance at special 6.99% Interest Rate), it sweetens the deal. 5. Maruti Ciaz AT If it's a mid-size sedan you are after, and you seek space, comfort, a big boot and rock-solid reliability all under 14 lakhs, look no further than the Ciaz, the 1.5L K-15B engine with 103 bhp of power and 138 nm of torque is a tried and tested engine (the same one that powers the Jimny) and with prices beginning from 13 lakhs OTR for Delta AT to 14.45 lakhs OTR for Alpha AT and discounts (Rs 25K Cash discount + 25K Exchange Bonus + 3000 Corporate discount) to sweeten the deal, the Ciaz is a good option if you are into a value for money sedan. 6. Hyundai i20 N-Line N6 DCT If you want an even sportier i20, then the N-Line is the one for you, with 118 bhp of power and 172 nm of torque, it is the only car which comes close to being a hot hatch in this segment, the N6 DCT costs 13.15 lakhs OTR, and you get upto 20k discount as well, if you can get a pre-facelift model (some dealerships still have a few in stock), you get over 50k cash discount too. 7. Maruti Brezza VXi AT The Brezza VXi AT costs 13.17 lakhs OTR and can be a worthy contender with proven safety (4-star GNCAP), a 1.5L K-15C series engine, and an adequate feature list. 8. Renault Kiger RXZ Turbo CVT The top-spec Kiger CVT costs 13.25 lakhs OTR and with up to Rs 65K Benefits (up to Rs 25K Cash + 20K Exchange + Rs 20K Loyalty). Additional Dealer End Offers on Select Variants, is an option worth considering as well. 9. Hyundai Venue S(O) Turbo DCT The Venue S(O) Turbo DCT costs around 13.5 lakhs OTR and is a powerful, modern car with an adequate feature list, a good option worth considering. 10. Kia Sonet HTX DCT If you like the pre-facelift Kia Sonet HTX DCT, now is the time to get your hands on one, at 14 lakhs OTR, it wasn't cheap but now with over 90k discounts and offers including 5 Year Warranty + 3 Year / 30,000 Kms Maintenance Package + Accessories Pack + Dealer End Stock Clearance Offers, it is a worthy contender in the sub 4 metre SUV space, and with the facelift launching next month, you could get an even sweeter deal. Do consider it. Now, to conclude, if you are after power, performance and features along with the SUV body style, the Sonet and the Venue are the best options here, if you want a VFM package, the Kiger and Magnite are the way to go, if its a sedan that you desire, the Ciaz and Amaze are great options, else if you want a hot-hatch the i20 N-Line is the best option available, otherwise, for a hatchback the regular i20 and Altroz are good options too. Now to your issue on DCT reliability, yes DCTs can be a bit risky owing to the complex technology involved but that doesn't deter customers from choosing them or manufacturers from providing them, always take the maximum possible extended warranty and take proper care to avoid DCT heating and you are good to go. Else for a more carefree and much more reliable experience, Torque Converter ATs and CVTs are the better options. Hope it helps! and feel free to DM me if you need any more help.", 19th December 2023,hyundai-venue,Muscat,712,"2,212",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
