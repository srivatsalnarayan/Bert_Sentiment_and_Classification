Priced competitively against rivals • Unique looks with the H-shaped LED DRLs & tail-lamps and crossover styling • Super-refined 4-cylinder engine offers good driveability and satisfactory fuel efficiency. AMT and CNG versions are available too • Hyundai AMTs have superior tuning as compared to the AMTs of Maruti, Tata etc. • Well-tuned suspension absorbs bumps well and delivers acceptable high-speed stability • Precise build & quality (including interiors) are among the segment best • Excellent ergonomics with light and well-placed controls • Spacious interiors with very good legroom and headroom for a car in this segment • Accommodating 391-litre boot is among the largest in the segment • Loaded with features such as a sunroof, keyless entry & go, dashcam with dual camera, auto headlamps, cruise control, paddle shifters, connected car features (BlueLink), wireless charger, rear A/C vents, multi-lingual voice commands, etc • Safety kit includes 6 airbags, 3-point seatbelts for all 5 occupants, ISOFIX child seat mounts, ABS, EBD, ESC, VSM, hill-hold assist, rear parking sensors and camera, TPMS, emergency stop signal, SOS call and more • Hyundai's wide service network & up to 7-years extended warranty Hyundai Exter Cons • Edgy looks & funky styling may not be to everyone's liking. Cuts and creases are overdone • Despite the unique styling, it’s not really a head-turner. Small size robs the Exter of road presence • 1.2L NA petrol’s highway performance is adequate, but not exciting • No turbo-petrol or diesel engine on offer • Not as engaging to drive as the Citroen C3 Turbo. Handling, steering and thin tyres won’t appeal to enthusiasts • Light-coloured interior theme isn’t available. Black interiors may not be to everyone's liking. Hyundai should’ve offered a beige option • Back seat is more suitable for 2 healthy adults and a child. Not 3 healthy adults • Rear seat is placed on the lower side, and its under-thigh support is average (taller folk will find it to be less) • Average sound system is no match for some of the rivals (e.g. Punch & Fronx have better ICE) • Some missing features like foglamps, rear centre armrest, auto-dimming IRVM, 60:40 split rear seat, 6-speaker sound system (Exter has just 4), full-sized spare tyre, etc. This review has been jointly compiled with SDP. Thanks to him for the expert observations! Introduction Over the past few years, we have seen a new segment emerging between hatchbacks and compact SUVs. This entry-level SUV segment has cars like the Tata Punch, Citroen C3, Maruti Fronx, Nissan Magnite and Renault Kiger. If you look at their sales figures, these cars are doing well for themselves. Now, Hyundai - one of the stronger players in the market, has decided to join the fray with the Exter, which slots below the Venue in the company’s SUV line-up. The Exter is manufactured at Hyundai's Sriperumbudur facility in Tamil Nadu. The car is available in 5 variants: EX, S, SX, SX(O) and SX(O) Connect. The car is available with a 1.2-litre, 82 BHP, 4-cylinder naturally-aspirated petrol mated to a 5-speed MT or 5-speed AMT. This makes the Exter less powerful than the 87 BHP Tata Punch, which Hyundai claims is its main rival. A petrol + CNG version of this engine with 68 BHP is also available. These engines can also be found in other Hyundai cars like the Grand i10 Nios and Aura. Hyundai Exter Price & Brochure As mentioned earlier, the Exter is available in 5 variants with prices ranging from Rs. 5,99,900 – Rs. 9,31,900 (ex-showroom) - click here for the full price list. These prices are more or less at par with the Tata Punch. Now, it must be remembered that of late, Tata Motors has been running Hyundai close in the race for second place in the sales charts when it comes to passenger vehicles. One of the cars responsible for helping Tata Motors climb up the charts is the Punch. Till now, Hyundai had nothing to counter Tata's entry-level SUV. With the introduction of the Exter at the above-mentioned prices, Hyundai will hope to once again cement its second position on the sales charts.

1, Aditya , 11:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Exterior Design & Styling The Exter uses Hyundai’s “Sensuous Sportiness” design philosophy. Its fairly boxy appearance leaves no doubt in one’s mind about which car the company is trying to take on. The body of the car is edgy and there are multiple sharp creases all over. We feel Hyundai has overdone things here. The car gets a piano black radiator grille, black cladding on the wheel arches and sides, silver skid plates, roof rails rear spoiler, sharkfin antenna and there's subtle use of chrome. Even so, the Exter is not really a head-turner. Some notable features on the outside are the projector headlamps, H-shaped LED tail-lamps, H-shaped LED DRLs and 15"" alloy wheels. On the other hand, LED headlamps and foglamps have not been provided. The car is offered in 6 single-tone and 3 dual-tone colour options. These include Ranger Khaki (our test car), Cosmic Blue, Starry Night (Blue), Fiery Red, Atlas White, Titan Grey, Cosmic Blue with Abyss Black Roof, Ranger Khaki with Abyss Black Roof and Atlas White with Abyss Black Roof. The Exter measures 3,815 mm in length, 1,710 mm in width, and 1,631 mm in height. It has a wheelbase of 2,450 mm. This makes it shorter in length and width, but taller than the Punch. It also has a longer wheelbase. On the whole, the small size of the Exter means that it lacks road presence. Build Quality, Fit & Finish The Exter is built on the K1 platform, which is shared with the Grand i10 Nios and Aura. The car’s bonnet and doors are not heavy, but not feather-light either, while the tailgate has some weight to it. That being said, the Exter does not feel flimsy. There’s very little flex in the body panels & doors and the car feels fairly well-built. Hyundai hasn’t revealed the kerb weight of the car though. The body panel gaps are uniform and the overall fit & finish levels are good. Wheels & Tyres The SX dual-tone, SX(O) and SX(O) Connect variants get 15-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels, while the SX single-tone variant gets 15-inch steel rims. The EX, EX(O), S and S(O) variants come with 14-inch steel wheels. Further, the S and S(O) variants get full-wheel covers. All 15-inch wheels come with 175/65 section tyres while the 14-inch rims get 165/70 section rubber. While the wheel and tyre combos fill up the wheel arches well, they look too small compared to the metal on top. The spare tyre is a 165/70 unit on a 14-inch steel wheel. Ground Clearance On paper, the Exter has an unladen ground clearance rating of 185 mm, which is 5 mm lesser than the Tata Punch and Maruti Fronx, but sufficient for Indian road conditions. For reference, the Citroen C3 has a GC of 180 mm and the Renault Kiger and Nissan Magnite have a GC of 205 mm. Standard & Extended Warranty With the Hyundai Exter, you get a standard warranty of 3 years / unlimited km. You can also get an extended warranty of up to 7 years and we strongly suggest taking it. Maintenance Hyundai offers various maintenance packages for up to 5 years. As a part of Hyundai Shield of Trust, the package covers major running parts like brakes, clutch, wipers, belts, etc. There’s also an additional Super package which further reduces the maintenance costs. Safety The Exter is equipped with safety features like ESP, VSM, ABS with EBD & brake assist, traction control, 3-point seatbelts for all five occupants, 6 airbags, ISOFIX child seat mounts, rear parking sensors and camera, dashcam with dual camera, auto headlamps, TPMS, emergency stop signal, hill-hold assist and SOS call. That being said, the car has not been tested by GNCAP or other independent bodies.", 17th July 2023,hyundai-exter,Mumbai,"17,608","76,004",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
2, Aditya , 11:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Interior Cabin Design & Quality Step inside the cabin and you can immediately tell that the dashboard is taken from the Grand i10 Nios. The design looks contemporary with a pleasant layout. The dashboard is black, but the colour of the inserts on it depends upon the body colour of the car. Our Ranger Khaki car had light sage inserts. Piano black has been used around the A/C vents, infotainment head-unit and instrument cluster. Hyundai is not offering a lighter interior colour scheme on the Exter. While the black interior will be easier to maintain, a beige interior certainly makes the cabin feel airier. You won't find any soft-touch plastics here, but the interiors are well put together. There aren't any rough edge plastics in places that one would usually touch and everything seems to be well-finished in the cabin. The part quality is good (as you would expect in a Hyundai car). Space & Comfort Ingress & egress are easy and you can just walk into the car without difficulty. The Exter is a tall car and it also has a long wheelbase, which translates to good space in the cabin. However, it’s not as wide as its rivals. So while 4 people will be comfortable in the cabin, a fifth one would feel cramped. The seats come with dual-tone leatherette-fabric upholstery with contrast piping & stitching and ""Exter"" branding. Like other parts, the quality of the upholstery is good. The seats offer a fair deal of support. They have side bolsters, which give good lateral support. However, heavier folk will find these side bolsters digging into their backs. While under-thigh support is good, back support could have been better. The actual backrest area is too thin. The driver seat gets height adjustment and can slide back far enough even for tall occupants to feel comfortable. Additionally, you do not get adjustable seatbelts or a centre armrest or any soft touch material on the armrests on the door pads. Driving Position & Ergonomics The Exter allows you to sit tall. Not only do you have a clear view of the road ahead, but you will also be able to see the bonnet (many drivers like that). While the front and side visibility for the driver is fine, the rear visibility is compromised by the thick C-pillars. You will have to use the camera while reversing. In the driver's seat, you'll get acquainted with all the controls pretty quickly. The three-spoke, leather-wrapped steering is perfectly sized and nice to hold, while the horn pad is easily reachable with your thumbs. The basic important controls - steering mounted buttons, stalks and gear lever are all within easy access. The steering can be adjusted for height and so too can the driver's seat, which means finding your perfect driving position is easy. A useable dead pedal has been provided as well. We’ll say that the ergonomics are sorted in this car. Cabin Storage There are a fair number of storage spaces in the cabin. You get a cooled (but not illuminated) glovebox, door pads that can hold a 1L bottle along with some other items, two cupholders and a narrow storage slot in the centre console and a wireless smartphone charging pad at the base of the centre fascia. There is also a long and fairly deep storage spot above the glovebox to keep a smartphone and other small items. There is no storage box on the centre console though. The left front seatback has a pocket for rear passengers to use. Air-Conditioning The Exter comes with a climate control unit with physical switches which feel nice to use. Except for the EX and EX(O), all variants get rear air vents. On a hot day in Rajasthan, the A/C functioned very well to keep us cool. Features Unique & Noteworthy Features The Exter comes with a healthy list of features. These include keyless entry & go, auto projector headlamps, LED DRLs, LED tail-lamps, sunroof with English and Hinglish voice commands, dashcam with dual cameras, USB Type C fast charger, cruise control, multi-function steering with tilt adjustment, automatic climate control, three-point seatbelts for all occupants, metal pedals (AMT only), front footwell lighting, wireless phone charging, rear A/C vents and a 12V power outlet at the rear. The AMT comes with paddle shifters as well. The Exter gets an 8-inch touchscreen head-unit with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, inbuilt navigation and OTA map and infotainment updates. The system also gets BlueLink connected car tech with 3 years free subscription with 60+ features for safety & security, remote services, location-based services, vehicle diagnostics and voice assistance. Further, the Exter gets over 90 voice commands that work even without internet connectivity. Embedded voice commands offer faster response time and the capability to compute Hinglish voice commands such as “Sunroof Kholo”, “Temperature Kam Kardo”, etc. The car also comes with H2C (Home to Car) Alexa in Hindi & English, infotainment with multi-language UI support (10 regional and 2 international languages) and Ambient Sounds of Nature with 7 acoustic profiles. Features such as rain-sensing wipers, auto-dimming IRVM, LED headlamps, seat lumbar adjustment, rear centre armrest and tweeters are missing. Audio System & Sound Quality Hyundai offers an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment head-unit. The user interface is simple and easy to get used to and the display is crisp and clear. It's extremely smooth and seamless in operation. It also gets physical rotary knobs and buttons for various functions. Music is played through 4 speakers. In terms of audio quality, it's just about adequate. Will give it a 6 / 10 at best, even after setting up the equalizer and all that. The ICE cannot handle bass-heavy songs & the max volume level is quite restricted. Hyundai needs to catch up with some others on this front. One expects a better system in a car costing as much as the Exter. Rear Passengers Rear Seat Comfort & Space Getting in and out of the rear seat isn't difficult. The rear bench is placed slightly lower than we would like. Even so, you do not need to sit down in it. The rear seats are comfortable and the cushioning is on point - neither too hard nor too soft. The seat is designed to accommodate three adults and comes with 3-point seatbelts for all 3 passengers. However, it comes with just 2 adjustable headrests. There is a wide and prominent floor hump and the centre console takes up some legroom. Therefore, the bench is more suitable for 2 adults and 1 child rather than 3 adults. The knee room at the rear is excellent and there's a good amount of headroom as well. At 5'10"", I had a lot of room to spare while sitting behind my driving position. Even occupants over 6' in height will find the headroom adequate. Overall, the space is more than adequate for most passengers. The backrest is also set at a comfortable angle. The under-thigh support is sufficient for most people, but taller occupants will find it too less for their liking. One of the complaints we have is that Hyundai has not provided a centre armrest. Rear occupants get A/C vents and a 12V power outlet to use. Boot Space The Exter has a boot space of 391 litres which is among the biggest of all sub-4 metre crossovers. In fact, the Exter’s boot is larger than that of its larger sibling, the Venue. Only the Renault Kiger (405 litres) and Kia Sonet (392 litres) have bigger boots. Folding the backrest of the rear seat down gives the car more luggage capacity. A bag hook and a light have been provided as well.", 17th July 2023,hyundai-exter,Mumbai,"17,608","76,004",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
3, Aditya , 11:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Driving the Hyundai Exter 1.2L Petrol MT 1.2L petrol engine makes 82 BHP @ 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm @ 4,000 rpm: The Exter is powered by the same 1.2L, 4-cylinder NA petrol that does duty in the Grand i10 Nios, Aura and Venue. It puts out 82 BHP, which is more than the NA units of the Citroen C3, Nissan Magnite and Renault Kiger, but lower than the Maruti Fronx's 89 BHP and Tata Punch's 87 BHP. The petrol engine has been around for a while now, but it is still a gem of an engine. With your foot on the clutch, press the engine start/stop button. One can immediately notice the sheer refinement of this motor. The petrol starts seamlessly. Torque delivery at low rpms and in city driving conditions is satisfactory by petrol standards. We could pull the engine from 800 rpm without any effort. Use the clutch and the engine will pull from as low as 500 rpm! Closing the gap to the car in front is no problem. One can drive around at 40 km/h in 5th gear with the tachometer reading 1,100 rpm. The refinement levels are outstanding and power comes in smooth. I didn't observe a single flat spot in the entire rpm range. Prod the engine further and its rev-happy nature becomes immediately evident. The 1.2L petrol feels eager on the open road and climbs clean to the 6,600 rpm limit. There is plenty of mid-range punch. The engine starts coming into its stride and ~1,700 rpm and pulls strongly from ~2,200 rpm Overtaking fast traffic only requires a downshift. Expressway performance is adequate. In terms of cruiseability, in 5th gear, 100 km/h is seen at 2,800 rpm. Overall, we would describe the performance of the Exter to be adequate, but not exciting. The 5-speed manual transmission is slick to operate. The throws are smooth and sure-slotting. The clutch is super light and the travel range is average. Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH) There is a very slight shake of the body as the engine cranks, but other than that, there are no vibrations felt inside the cabin. At idle, you will not even know that the engine is running. While driving around calmly, the cabin remains silent. Even at 80 km/h. one doesn’t need to raise his voice to talk to the other occupants of the car. However, as the revs climb past 3,200 rpm or so, the engine makes itself heard in the cabin. The engine feels smooth when high-revving, though it can get fairly vocal over 5,000 rpm. It never sounds rough or bad. Wind noise starts creeping into the cabin above 100 km/h. While it gets louder with speed, it’s not excessive at 120 km/h. Road noise and tyre noise are average. Mileage & Fuel Economy The 1.2L naturally aspirated petrol has an ARAI-certified fuel efficiency of 19.4 km/l for the MT and 19.2 km/l for the AMT. In our short drive, which included some fast driving and idling we saw 15-16 km/l on the MID. With better driving, we are pretty sure that the engine will deliver much better FE figures. No insulation sheet under the bonnet: No underbody protection. You can see the ground below clearly: Suspension Ride Comfort The Exter comes with a McPherson strut suspension at the front and a coupled torsion beam suspension at the rear. The ride over small potholes and uneven roads at city speeds is compliant. No bumps are transmitted hard into the cabin. Even over bad roads, the suspension does a good job of keeping the car's occupants comfortable. Of course, large potholes do register themselves in the cabin, but overall, the ride quality is very compliant. The suspension works silently too. The higher variants of the Exter ride on 15-inch wheels with 175/65 section tyres and the recommended tyre pressure is 32 PSI. Handling & Dynamics The Exter has a suspension setup that’s on the softer side. Straight-line stability is good for a car in this segment and occupants won't even know that the car is cruising at triple-digit speeds. Expansion joints on the highway do not unsettle it, but it does wallow a little. On long curves, the car holds its line well. Push the car on twisty roads and you will experience body roll. Our test car came with 175/65 R15 JK UX Royale tyres. While these are fine for regular driving, they are just not good enough for spirited cornering. The body roll, numb steering and skinny tyres mean that the Exter is not very happy being pushed hard on twisty roads. It’s better to drive the car within its limits and yours. Steering The Exter gets an electric power steering, which is very user-friendly. It's light at parking and city speeds and most owners will appreciate that. The compact dimensions of the car, light steering and a tight turning radius make it very easy to drive in the city. At higher speeds, the steering weighs up and there’s little vagueness in the centre. However, from an enthusiast's perspective, there’s nothing on offer. It feels very disconnected and light even at high speeds and on twisty roads, you will find that it doesn't relay much feedback. Braking The Exter is equipped with disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear. The performance is as expected and the car comes to a halt without much drama. Under hard braking too, the car doesn't lose its composure. That being said, wider tyres would have improved braking further.", 17th July 2023,hyundai-exter,Mumbai,"17,608","76,004",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
4, Aditya , 11:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Hyundai Exter Exterior Images The front end is the best-looking part of the car. It features H-shaped LED DRLs connected by a slim black insert, ""EXTER"" lettering, a piano black parametric design radiator grille, projector headlamps and a silver skid plate: Rear features many cuts and creases. You get H-shaped tail lamps with a piano black parametric design applique connecting them and a skid plate. Exhaust pipe peeps out from the right: Distinct creases & bulges on the sides give the car character. Black body cladding lends it a rugged look and makes it appear tall: Notice the number of cuts and creases on the side! There is no clean panel anywhere on the car: The Exter measures 3,815 mm in length, 1,710 mm in width, and 1,631 mm in height with a wheelbase of 2,450 mm. Despite all the attempts to make the Exter look like an SUV, the small size robs it of street presence: H-shaped DRLs are unique and look amazing. Halogen turn-indicators are located in the same housing: A look at the LED DRLs and turn-indicators in action: Black insert connects the LED DRLs. ""EXTER"" lettering is located on the bumper below: Halogen projector headlamps are placed on the bumper, just below the DRLs. They get chrome housings: Wide piano black parametric design radiator grille is located on the bumper. An air dam is provided below the number plate. A large silver skid plate has fake screw detailing and a wind deflector has been provided below: Shockingly, no underbody protection at all! Not even a plastic cover below the engine: Like the rest of the car, the bonnet gets strong creases. It features a large ""H"" badge: Glossy black ORVMs are electrically-foldable and have integrated turn-indicators with silver inserts. They also have an auto-folding function on lock / unlock: Body-coloured door handles with a black request sensor and keyhole on the driver's door. No request sensor or keyhole on the front passenger's door: Panel gaps are tight and uniform all over: 15-inch diamond cut alloys are shod with 175/65 section JK UX Royale tyres. Mud flaps have been provided just ahead of the wheels: Drum brakes at the rear. Just like the front, mud flaps have been provided just ahead of the wheels: Front wheel wells get full plastic cladding, while rear ones get a thin rubberised coating: Glass area is large and lets in a lot of light: C-pillar is thick and features parametric detailing: To add to the muscular look, the Exter gets glossy black roof rails. Sunroof is available in SX, SX(O) and SX(O) Connect variants: Rear section of the roof is ribbed and carries a sharkfin antenna. Notice how the roof curves downwards: Tail-lamp clusters consist of H-shaped pilot lamps, halogen stop lamps, reversing lamps and turn-indicators: A look at the H-shaped LED tail-lamps in action: Dynamic rear spoiler houses the HMSL: Rear windshield is adequately sized. Tailgate gets a parametric design piano black applique connecting the tail lamps and houses badges depicting the model and variant: Rear camera is tucked away above the number plate (on the left): Dual-tone bumper houses two parking sensors and a large silver skid plate with slim reflectors.

5, Aditya , 11:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Hyundai Exter Interior Images All-black dashboard with 3D pattern design crashpad and light sage inserts. Interiors are well-designed, nice looking and user-friendly. Ergonomics are absolutely perfect with all controls falling easily to hand: Windscreen is large and offers a good view of the road ahead. The seating position is a little high up, but it's more like a tall hatchback than an SUV. Some will appreciate that they can view the bonnet while driving: Leather-wrapped steering wheel is carried over from the other Hyundai cars. The bottom spoke gets this gunmetal black-like finish to go with the all-black theme. Steering can be adjusted for height only, not for reach: Buttons for the infotainment system, telephony and voice commands are placed on the left spoke. Buttons for operating the MID and cruise control are placed on the right spoke. Toggle switches get silver inserts: Engine start/stop button has a brushed silver ring around it: Fully-digital instrument cluster with a speedometer on the left, 4.2-inch MID in the middle and tachometer on the right is easy to read. Digital fuel and temperature gauges have been provided: Notice how the number of red lines around the speedometer and tachometer increases as the revs rise. The rev counter turns red at 6,500 rpm: The MID shows average and instant fuel consumption, distance-to-empty counter, a single trip meter, & outside temperature reading. The trip meter shows the distance travelled, average consumption and time taken. The MID further shows a summary of the drive when you switch the car off: MID also displays turn-by-turn navigation, TPMS readings and the specific door that is open. It also tells you if the bonnet or tailgate is open: Stalks exude quality! As has been mentioned before, the quality of plastics is very good for this segment. Left stalk controls the functions of the front and rear wipers, whereas the right stalk controls the headlamps and front foglamp. While automatic headlamps have been provided, automatic rain-sensing wipers have been left out: Side air-con vents are circular and get gloss black rings with light sage highlights around them. They throw out a serious amount of air: Switches for the rear camera and headlamp level adjustments are located below. The traction control off button is also located here (don't ever use it unless starting off on slippery surfaces like slush & snow): Like the dashboard, the door pads get an all-black theme. The upper portion gets an insert with 3D detailing just like the crashpad on the dashboard. While all the plastics are hard, the door pads are well-finished with no sharp edges anywhere. They are scooped out where you would rest your arm: Door handles get a dark grey metal finish. They feel sturdy: Console houses the usual set of buttons. Only the driver's window gets one-touch up/down and anti-pinch functionality and only the driver’s window button is backlit. In fact, the other window switches are not even marked. Door mirrors are electrically foldable. ORVM adjuster selector switch is weird. One of the two mirrors is always selected - there is no middle / dead position. So, if by chance, you press the adjuster, one of the mirrors will change its angles: Door pad can hold a 1-litre bottle and other small items: Front seats of the SX, SX(O) and SX(O) Connect variants are draped in a combination of fabric and leatherette upholstery with contrast stitching and ""EXTER"" embossed on the backrests. They are good-looking, wide and offer a fair deal of support. They have side bolsters, which give good lateral support. However, heavier folk will find these side bolsters digging into their backs. While under-thigh support is good, back support could have been better. The actual backrest area is too t-h-i-n and the headrests are fixed: A closer look at the fabric... ...and leatherette upholstery and the contrast stitching & piping. The quality of materials used is good: All variants get height adjustment for the driver's seat: No height adjustment for the front passenger seat: Seatbelts are not height-adjustable but are placed at a comfortable height. Both front seatbelts get pre-tensioners: Pedals are properly spaced out. A very useable dead pedal has been provided as well. AMT versions of the SX, SX(O) and SX(O) Connect variants get metal pedals: Fuel flap release is placed on the floor: ORVMs are sufficiently tall, but could have been wider: IRVM looks upmarket. It is wide enough to cover the entire rear windshield: IRVM houses 3 buttons - the SOS button will place an emergency call to Hyundai customer care, the button with the tow truck will call Hyundai Roadside Assistance and the third button will launch Blue Link. However, for all these advanced features, Hyundai has not provided the auto-dimming function - a huge miss!!! You get a standard day / night manual flick switch: Dual-way dash cam with a 2.31-inch LCD display features full HD quality, smartphone-based connectivity with an Android / IOS-based app and multiple recording modes to capture photos and video: The rearward view is just average. The rear windshield is fair in size, but the C-pillars are thick. Better to rely on the reversing camera and parking sensors: Centre fascia tilts slightly towards the driver. It features an 8-inch touchscreen head unit. A thick dark grey border with a metal finish runs around the air-con vents. Piano black is used around the infotainment screen. Switches and knobs are located on either side of the head unit: 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system is sleek to operate and gets wired Android Auto & Apple CarPlay and onboard navigation: Touchscreen has a crisp display and is visible even under direct sunlight, but the audio quality is just adequate: Infotainment system gets BlueLink telematics and offers 60+ connected car features. Prominent features include multi-regional support (12 languages - 10 regional and 2 international), OTA updates for the infotainment system and maps and Home2Car: integrated with Alexa: Another feature is the ambient sounds of nature. This will play a selection of sounds through the speakers: Touchscreen doubles up as a display for the rearview camera and features adaptive guidelines which indicate the path that the car is going to take (based on steering input). As we have seen earlier, there are 2 rear parking sensors provided on the car. The camera has a nice wide angle, while the display quality is fair: Climate control system gets easy-to-read black buttons and light sage inserts on the knobs. The cooling performance is very impressive. Hyundai has equipped the Exter with Eco Coating - a technology that is claimed to eliminate air-conditioner odour: 2 USB ports and a 12V power outlet are located below the climate control system on the centre fascia. The Type C port on the left can only be used for fast charging, while the Type A unit on the right can be used to connect your smartphone to the infotainment system as well as for charging purposes. 12V power outlet gets a flip-up plastic cover. Hyundai has provided a plug-in USB port that can be slotted into the 12V charging socket. It comes with a plastic cover: The base of the center fascia features a wireless smartphone charger Remember, your smartphone needs to have the wireless charging function for this feature to work: 5-speed leather-wrapped gear knob gets a glossy black top with a silver border. Gear lever has a leather boot: Bird's eye view of the handbrake console. Hyundai should have given a centre armrest with a storage box in this car: Crashpad gets 3D detailing. Long and fairly deep storage spot above the glovebox gets a lip to keep parked items from falling. This is a good place for the front passenger to keep his smartphone and other small items: Glovebox is medium-sized. It gets a cooling vent, but no illumination: Roof bezel consists of map lights and sunroof controls: Bluetooth mic is positioned above the driver on the roofliner. It should have been integrated into the roof lamp console for a cleaner look IMHO: Sunvisors are economy-grade in design, yet they don’t feel flimsy. Driver-side unit merely gets a flap to hold tickets, but no mirror or illumination. Passenger-side sunvisor gets a vanity mirror, but there's no cover or light provided: 6 airbags are standard on all variants of the Exter. These include dual front airbags, side airbags and curtain airbags: Size of the sunroof is adequate for the cabin: With the sunroof (or even its cover) open, a lot of light comes into the cabin. This is the max it opens to: SX(O) and SX(O) Connect variants are equipped with ambient footwell lighting: Brown keyfob with silver buttons and chrome highlights is similar to other Hyundai cars. We like the design, but not the brown: Like the front doorpads, the ones at the rear have an all-black theme. The rear speakers are housed in them: Door pockets can hold a 1-litre bottle and some knick-knacks: Legroom is sufficient even for occupants with longer limbs: The seatback has a comfortable angle. There is enough headroom for even taller occupants, but thigh support is lacking: Rear seat is more suitable for 2 adults and a child, rather than 3 adults. While the seat base is largely flat, the seatbacks have some contours to hold you in place. 2 adjustable headrests have been provided along with ISOFIX child seat anchors on both sides, but there is no centre armrest: All 3 occupants get 3-point seatbelts: Rear window is large and lets a lot of light into the cabin: Seatbacks of the front seats are slightly scooped out & soft, liberating more knee room for the rear passengers. Front seatback pocket only for the left side passenger. It is not very wide or deep: Rear air-con vents are provided on all, except the EX and EX(O) variants. While there is only one common air volume controller, their direction can be adjusted individually. 12V power outlet sits below the rear air-con vents. No USB port for rear passengers to use: Floor hump is wide and prominent: Spring-loaded grab handles have been provided above all passenger doors. Only the rear-right unit gets a coat hook: Whitish-grey roof liner is scooped out at the rear to release some additional headroom. It dips down where the sunroof is located. : 2nd cabin lamp is placed behind the sunroof, hence serving both (front & rear) seat rows: 391-litre boot is among the biggest in the segment. It is large enough to accommodate luggage for weekend family trips: High-loading lip means you have to make an effort to put your bags in or take them out: Lower part of the tailgate is cladded on the inside: Large parcel tray comes with a recessed area and prominent border to keep things from rolling onto the rear seat: Boot light is located on the right: Bag hook has been provided on the left: Folding the rear backrest down gives you a much larger cargo capacity. However, the Exter doesn't come with an adjustable boot floor and you cannot get a flat loading bay: Spare wheel in all trim levels is a 14-inch steel unit with 165/70 section rubber. The higher variants should definitely have gotten a spare of the same size as the regular wheels. Tools are housed in a soft bag, which sits in the spare wheel: Disclaimer: Hyundai invited Team-BHP for the Exter test drive.

23, JacksonStorm , 16:59 ,BHPian,"Great review! Thanks to the team. Hyundai India has already increased the annual production capacity to 8.5 lakh units. It includes domestic sales and export sales. Earlier monthly reports said domestic sales were between 40K and 50K units. Export sales: around 10,000 units every month Total per month: 50K + 10K = 60K per month. Total per year: 60K*12 = 7.2 lakhs per year. If they increase production capacity by 8.5 lakh units, Total per month: 60K + 11K = 71K units per month. Total per year: 71K*12 = 8.52 lakh units per year. It clearly indicates that Exter will close at 10K units for sure per month. Mostly, it will cannibalize in this order. Venue > i20 > Aura > Nios It means It will be affected mostly by Venue and least by Nios in my IMHO. If Exter scores 4 or 5 stars in crash testing, then it will be a tough time for Tata Punch. Until then, it is a neck-and-neck competition between Punch and Exter. We will know anyway after 3-6 months of monthly sales reports. Within Hyundai's below-par comparison with respect to price, customers can choose their own affordable product based on their personal interests and choices if they are willing to choose Hyundai cars. In this comparison, the i20 Sportz MT (8.09 lakh) and Exter SX MT (8 lakh) are almost the same price. After discounts, the i20 Sportz is the best value for money. The same case is applicable to the i20 Sportz MT dual tone (Rs. 8.24 lakh) and Exter SX MT Dual tone (Rs. 8.23 lakh). If customers prioritized the sunroof as a feature then Exter is the clear win here. 1. Rs. 8 lakh range (Rs. 7.73 lakh to Rs. 8.24 lakh including Dual tone) 2. Rs. 9 lakh range (Rs. 8.61 lakh to Rs. 9.01 lakh) 3.

29, Venku2015 , 20:26 ,BHPian,"So, guys, I happened to test drive the Exter SX(O) AMT DT today. The test drive was with a total of 3 occupants with the AC set to 20 degrees. I will breakdown my observations categorically as follows: Build quality: It felt at least 25% better than other Hyundai cars like the Gi10 Nios, new Verna and Alcazar, which were parked beside the Exter in the showroom. The door didn't have the typical European thud but was better than other cars. Engine and Gearbox: Was pleasantly surprised by the refinement of this little 1.2 NA engine. It's dead silent at idle and you need to look at the speedo to realize that the engine is running. Now the Hyundai wild card in the Exter chapter is the AMT gearbox which does come with paddle shifters! Yes, I think this is the only car in its segment to come with paddle shifters and it's fun to use. Gearshifts are way faster if you compare them with other brand AMT cars in the market. It's very well-tuned and the best AMT in the market today. Behaves 85% like a Torque Converter AT box! The engine doesn't feel as punchy as the Suzuki 1.2 but has a good mid-range. It takes a while to pick up from lower speeds but fares better as the revs climb. One will also enjoy the engine note at 4k+ rpm, it sounds sweet Handling & suspension: The steering is feather lite at parking speeds and weighs up slightly at higher speeds, but not very confidence inspiring. It also auto-centres after taking a turn which is a plus. The suspension felt about adequate, it's a bit on the softer side, but didn't bottom out easily. No issues with the 185mm GC either, more than sufficient to handle the tallest of speed breakers. Space: Its got ample headroom for all passengers, but lacks under-thigh support at the rear. Also, the rear is strictly for 2 adults, even a 5-year-old kid will fit in tightly with two adults at the rear. The boot is spacious and can swallow two big-size suitcases and one duffel bag, but the loading lip is very high, something like the Baleno. Feature-wise Hyundai has nailed it, and gets everything one could imagine in this segment, only thing it lacked is the auto wipers and ventilated seats! Overall it's a great buy & super VFM car for the city and occasional highway runs. We booked the SX(O) AMT by putting down an 11k token amount. Deliveries will be fast as the sales rep said Hyundai has planned a large production plan with the Exter and was promised delivery within 45 days. Pro Tip: Do not buy the SX(O) AMT DT variant, instead go for the SX(O) AMT, you will save a massive 48K in the on-road Karnataka price. You can anyways get the roof wrapped for about 10k outside.", 17th July 2023,hyundai-exter,Belgaum,167,350,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

Worse, is not being able to retrofit it in most cases. Let me try to answer it. I'm an automobile engineer by profession and so know things where and how the cost will be tried to be lowered. Now if you see Hyundai has also skimped the adjustable seatbelt option (which even some Suzuki cars like swift get on their top models). The simple evaluation done here by the company will be; most of the customers never use the adjustability (we as enthusiasts know it's importance, but not the masses), same goes for the auto dimming IRVMs. I have never seen anyone in my known circle using the auto dimming feature, even the manual one. People just don't know or even if they know, they don't use it frequently enough for the company to see as a feature which the customer will long for. Rather the company will save money there and give features like the sunroof, digital instruments.etc which actually lures or makes the customer feel good about the car! Contrary there are companies like VW which will never do this. They'll give all the important features like adjustable seatbelts, telescopic adjustment for steering, adjustable headrests for all occupants, auto-dimming IRVMs.etc, but will loose out on frills features. The result? We lost cars like POLO, FABIA, PUNTO.etc which were actually true gems of cars (in terms of dynamics, engine performance, safety and basically the absolute basics of a sweet car!). Some of that is being brought back by TATA Cars to some extent, but that does take toll on their features list and quality of interiors.etc related to finesse (which also comes from experience as in the case of Mahindra learning a lot from SsangYong and applying that in their latest products!).

42, firingpistonz , 11:55 ,BHPian,"Hello prospective Exter owners. This is not a rant/praise against one specific car. Being objective here. I just got a Tata Punch a month ago. When I booked a Punch, only the spy shots of the Exter were available and the only thing that was know to us was that It will be based on the Grand i10 Nios. Me and my wife tool a look at the those photos and 1. Were not impressed with the looks 2. Knew that the Exter will not be as well built as a Tata 3. Knew that it will not handle bad patches of roads as well as the Punch Because of these reasons we did not cancel our booking and we went ahead with our booking. But we very well knew that the engine/gearbox combo will be better than the punch. Now that we have the Punch with us we are happy with many things, we aren't with some others. A couple of weeks later the Exter is officially launched and the prices are announced. I was very disappointed that I could've waited and was waiting for the comparison videos, as I was sure that all the reviews will wax eloquent on the Exter. ( Probably rightly so). So finally youtuber DDS has released a comparison video between the two with the Punch owner doing the comparison. I felt the video was genuine and the points he makes are correct. While each car has its own pros and cons, there is only one that has an SUV-like stance and behaves like one(atleast the one with tougher suspension and how it handles bad roads). And as the owner says, both the cars have been built with different intentions and the Exter caters to people with specific usage and so is the punch. Sharing the video for everyone's reference. Might help someone who is comparing between the two. http://youtu.be/-S5fAkHa0EM Also let me re-iterate. My intention is not to bad mouth any product. But I'm sure now that I've made the correct choice. 😀", 18th July 2023,hyundai-exter,BENGALURU,33,33,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

Having said that, Tata comes with a significant pain of dealing with their ASS, plus the gearbox and engine combo makes it a pain to drive. I own a Nexon EV Max and I promised my grandparents on the day of delivery of that car, that I'll buy them the Punch (I always loved the looks). However, what i've suffered with the Tata ASS, in a city like Bangalore, I was left very disappointed. Grandparents coming froma small Tier 3 city, where Tata doesn't even have a showroom, I couldn't imagine the pain it will take in case anything goes wrong (which also is something more often with Tata). Decided to book Fronx first, but the pricing disappointed massively and then booked the Exter. Happy with the product, always liked Hyundai service and they recently opened a showroom in our city, which has been great. Looking forward to the Fiery Red Exter SX delivery! Punch is a great product let down by Tata's service and engine-gearbox combo.

46, shankar.balan , 18:51 ,BANNED,"I took an hour from my day today to go nearby and see the Hyundai Exter. I shall just focus on my own workman-like impressions of this vehicle, purely as a normal, no-frills, lay-person consumer. I have honestly NOT yet read the official review and I have barely participated in this thread. And the last Hyundai we had, was my Dad’s 2014 Hyundai I20 Asta manual Petrol. Saying all this, right from the moment they published the teasers and ads of the Exter and the brochures online, I have been quite attracted to this little vehicle as an option that may be considered for my Dad, as a replacement to his 2019 Toyota Glanza. Hence I've been very keen to see and drive this Exter for some time now. I have said earlier that I like its looks. Today I was able to reaffirm that liking. It is indeed a chunky and good-looking design. Today, I got that chance I wanted. I had a very pleasant experience at the Exter showroom, because there was only one small family there and two other people looking at various cars (I also saw their new Verna and it certainly does look very aggressive and handsome). It is a pleasant experience when there is no unnecessary hype and hoopla. And when clear information and display vehicles and test drive vehicles are made available easily so as to ensure the paying public remains engaged with the brand, in a new launch. The Exter closely resembles its older brothers, the Venue and Creta. However, it is just a little shorter than the Venue when viewed from the side. I am very appreciative of the space engineering inside and external appearance that these new Hyundais have! The display car is the MT Top Spec single-tone. The test drive car was the AMT Top Spec single tone. Both were in this rather lovely shade of khaki/ green which incidentally looks quite close in shade and tone, to my Rocky Beige Thar. (Being faintly militaristic in nature, this colour is amongst my personal favourites.) I am not going to compare the Exter with the Tata Punch and Nexon and Citroen C3. I am just going to share my own impressions of it. I sat in the rear left passenger seat with the front passenger seat pushed back to my own seating position and despite being a big built person of 6.2 height I found the rear seat perfectly comfortable. Yes even the under-thigh support was acceptable as was the leg room. I think it is to do with the rake angle of the seat cushion squab. There was adequate lumbar support too. The adjustable head rests give me an essential support at the base of the back of my neck which allows for a certain comfort in the neck-rest aspect. While I would normally never sit as a rear passenger in any car, excepting if it is a Taxi, I believe that I will be able to sit comfortably in this Exter as a rear passenger and go from Bangalore to Mysore. The driver’s seat is height adjustable so I brought it to its lowest point and adjusted the backrest for my driving position. It was nice to sit in and offered very good visibility all around. Here when first seated, there was an impression of under-thigh support being a little less. But once I adjusted the seat and started driving, I found I was quite comfortable indeed. No problem even despite my height. There has been talk about the integrated and non-adjustable front headrests, but I actually am not grumbling about these. They are perfectly adequate as per my impression. Ingress and egress in all the seats is perfectly comfortable and the seating and driving position is also very good. Headroom, leg room and foot room are fine across all the 4 seats. (I cannot think of all these cars as being anything more than 4 seaters.) with the driving position, one won’t miss seeing the potholes while driving. Yes, it isn’t quite like the Thar which feels like you’re looking out of the first floor balcony; it is more like the Jimny in this aspect and it is perfectly handy for our driving and operating conditions. The sharply raked windscreen gave me an excellent line of sight to everything around me. I did not feel the A-Pillar Blindness the way it is there in my Thar. Yet, though it isn’t as unobtrusive as the A Pillar of the Jimny, the angle at which it is raked easily compensates! I liked the steering wheel a lot. It felt nice and chunky to hold. Feels substantial. The instrument panel and the cluster of digital information and gauges are easy to read and provide all the necessary info. The music system sounded reasonable but that is not my real area of interest in a car. Being broad daylight I did not bother with the lights. The horn however is very weak and I think one of the first things anyone will tend to do especially in India, is to change that. The indicator stalks and all are decently built and the indicator click-click sound is of a ‘softened intensity’ which feels and sounds quite nice. Quite premium in fact. The plastics in this car are of the hard grey-black variety and I guess that is to be expected considering the price it is being offered at. I am very happy about the 6 Airbags that it comes with and of course, the other safety features that it offers, along with a few of the other gizmos. Unlike the maps in my Thar, this Exter’s maps seem to be perfectly well synchronised and calibrated. And for all those grumbling about the Jimny and its lack of bottle storage space and general storage space, they will be quite happy with the little Exter. It has some pretty decent cubbies for all manner of odds and ends and yes, the bottle storage is perfectly adequate across all 4 doors. There are a nice couple of charge ports and a wireless charger mat as well which is a good thing. The OEM dash cam feels a bit plasticky to the touch but will do the job of providing that essential recorded footage. The reversing camera’s quality is surprisingly good and offers a very decent definition of visual. The manually operated cover for the sunroof allows for some level of ‘feel’ of more light and lightness on a long drive. However, the quality of the glass itself felt a little less-than-solid to the touch. The doors all open and shut with a decent enough thunk. The boot space is nice and roomy. Coming from a Thar I guess I am bound to feel that way but it is actually quite useable being a well-designed high-set large-hatch. The rear seat does not have split folding. But once the whole thing is folded, it becomes a large and capacious luggage carrier space. I took the car for a test drive - the AMT version. And we drove it for about 6-7 km, on the slip roads on the Hosur Road and on some back roads too. We also drove it for about a Km on a rutted, undulating, uneven, unpaved mud track nearby. I have never driven any of the Hyundai AMTs before, and I have come away very impressed indeed. It has the normal Auto and the Manual mode. In Auto, it holds lower gears till about 1600-1800 rpm and then upshifts. There is a mild slingshot effect felt. If one slows down to near dead halt to negotiate a badly designed hump, and then after crossing the said hump, if one accelerates smoothly, one finds the lower gear being held till the above rpm and then it’s almost like a ‘second wind’ that the car gets, when shifting to a higher gear, hence this above-mentioned impression of the slingshot effect. The AMT is pretty smooth but one feels that kick at 1600-1800 rpm. It does not hunt for gears. It does whine a little but not as much as the Jimny 4-speed TC does and definitely not as much as Dad’s Glanza CVT does. There is highly adequate low-end grunt and one doesn’t feel out of breath even at the upper end. The engine feels nice and smooth and silent. No drama and no unhappy noises and all. It has enough power to overtake, even in Auto mode. The manual mode is responsive and while it will never give the same feeling of instant ‘kick down’ as my Thar TC gives, it is still pretty respectable. The power delivery cannot be as instant or linear as it is in my Petrol Thar, but again, it is perfectly respectable. The vehicle feels competent in a straight line. It brakes well in a straight line. I did do some level of hard barking as a test and found myself to be satisfied. The ride comfort of this vehicle is very good indeed, the driving seat and all don’t ‘hug’ one, but it provides a lot of support. Lumbar support is included and it feels snug. I took a couple of curves a little quickly (60kmph) and did not experience the unexpected. There is as usual some level of roll, but well contained since it is a well-sprung monocoque. Even on the above-mentioned uneven mud track which I drove on, the vehicle performed very competently indeed. One does not feel the side-to-side swaying the way one feels in the Thar. Yes, the Exter is much lower set but still. It feels comfortable when driven on such roads. It won’t shake you up unutterably. It is more comfy than even the Jimny with its well-publicised well-tuned suspension. Its inherent 185mm ground clearance certainly gives a lot of confidence to tackle the typical urban and countryside conditions which we experience in India. Very good suspension tuning in my opinion. The steering is well-weighted and not ‘lifeless’ as I have regularly been led to believe that Hyundai steerings are. The EPS is decent. Light enough for the city. Firm enough for the highway. Turning radius is very comfortable in the city. This vehicle will be good for both city driving and highway trips. The stock tyres are 175/65/15 JK UX Royale. These do provide very decent cushioning. However, they don’t really fill the wheel arches very well. And it will be the wish of most buyers, to do a small upsize of the tyres to perhaps 195’s. 205’s I believe may be a bit too much to upsize to. It would also be very nice if the Hyundai folks were to offer a Sport or an N Line version of this Exter with one of their neat little small-yet-grunty Turbo Petrol engines and a nice lightly growly exhaust. This Exter is temptingly positioned. It is priced well (Rs. 12.31 lacs on-road in Bangalore for the top-spec AMT single-tone version is a fair price in my book, for this vehicle). It comes with this excellent Hyundai Service commitment to Indian consumers. It is a very competent and comfortable vehicle with good features and plenty of safety kit especially at the price at which it is offered. It is calculated to appeal to a wide cross-section of small families, young singles and elders. The colour palette is attractive. It is a neat little outdoorsy Smart Activity Vehicle, if one doesn’t want to call it an SUV. It offers that ‘sense of adventure’ somehow though maybe not quite as much as maybe the Jimny offers. But then, this is a vehicle that will appeal to a far wider audience than the Jimny can ever hope to. I think it offers fantastic value and is bound to succeed in this market. Hyundai, (with or without SRK’s plug) is to be greatly appreciated for taking our Indian consumers seriously and addressing the market with honest sincerity. No wonder they are a great success in India. They deserve every bit of it my considered opinion. Will I ask my Dad to change from his Glanza to this Exter? I will definitely ask him to drive it and see if he likes it. If he does like it, then it is a very worthy option to consider.", 18th July 2023,hyundai-exter,Bangalore,"11,368","23,077","Steering, Handling or Ride",Very Positive

60, Jattitude , 12:44 ,BHPian,"We currently own a Tata Harrier and a Tigor EV and were looking for a small city hatchback/ equivalent in AT, primarily for my wife. My wife and I test-drove the following cars in the past fortnight: (Booked the Hyundai Exter SX AMT at the end of the experience) (1) Maruti Suzuki Celerio VXi AMT: A wobbly, uninspiring ride at city speeds. Our heads kept wobbling forward each time the AMT changed gears. On top of that, the car kept wobbling horizontally. Tata Motors has thoroughly spoilt us. Celerio looks cute in its latest avatar, and the interior seats and space are very comfortable for our needs. Still, at on-road Rs. 7,50,000/- it is enormously expensive for what it offers. Honestly, no amount of resale value and good mileage can make me purchase it. (2) Maruti Suzuki Alto AMT: A very claustrophobic car to sit in, and we immediately rejected it without a test drive. (3) Maruti Suzuki Ignis AMT: Better to drive than the Celerio. An AMT that is less jerky than the Celerio, but my wife did not like the looks and was rejected. (4) Tata Punch Creative AMT: Tata needs to fire the team or Executive that named the variants of Tata Punch. Why would you complicate the names of variants in this fashion? The variants ought to be named in a fashion to make things simpler for the customers. It's a good-looking car, and the front design makes it looks like a mini-Harrier. Being a Harrier owner for the last ~4 years, I can ascertain that this is a timeless design, and you will look at it adoringly even after several years of ownership. Coming to the interiors of the Punch, we did not like the seats (both front and rear). Even Celerio had better seats. The dashboard and the touchscreen, too, looked dated. The interior is not the one that will make you happy sitting inside it. The drive was also nothing to write home about, as the 3-cylinder engine is not refined, and engine noise creeps into the cabin even at city speeds. AMT tuning is better than Celerio, but mild jerks can be felt in the cabin while the AMT is changing gears. We did not enjoy the ride and immediately made up our minds that this was not the car for us. My wife and I believe this car is merely selling such numbers because of the new space it created sans competition. A good competitive product will bring the numbers down, tumbling. (5) Tata Altroz DCA: Now this an excellent hatchback! Everything from the exterior to the interior screams premiumness. The ride (barring the three-cylinder engine) was excellent. DCA is superbly tuned, NVH is excellent, and the seats are fantastic. My wife and I loved the car, which moved to the top of our shortlist. Due to owning 2 Tata cars, I have a good relationship with the SC staff, who are very cooperative. They indirectly nudged me towards the Punch's AMT instead of opting for the DCA. Now if the SC people aren't comfortable with their own DCA, who am I to take that risk? We struck the Altroz off our list because of this reason. (6) Hyundai Exter SX AMT: I booked this car (S AMT variant) pre-launch to be in the queue in case we liked it. The car launched, and we visited the showroom on the 11th. The model on display was SX(O) AMT in Ranger Khaki-Black DT. The car looks fresh in the flesh, and while plenty of people haven't liked the looks, we liked the aesthetics straightway. This is coming from a place where I haven't liked any Hyundai car pre-2022. But, off late, I have begun to appreciate the design language used in the latest Tucson and Verna. The TD car was only going to be made available in 1-2 days, so we played around with the display car. The doors, while not as solid as our Tata cars, are way better than Maruti cars but also better than those on the i20 and i10. Combined with passive safety features such as 6 airbags and ESC, this car makes a solid case for a decently safe city car. I am 169 cm, and my wife and I found both the front and rear seats to be very comfortable in terms of the under-thigh support and the incline of the rear seats. It made the Punch backseat seem like a bench. I was thankful that my left knee wasn't hitting the dashboard, which happens in both of my Tata Cars. The interiors looked fresh with good quality plastic used. Fabric inserts in strategic places might have helped, but one has to be mindful of the car's segment and the other features already given as standard by Hyundai. The car seemed like a good option for our use case, and we decided to return for a TD. The TD car was ready the next day, i.e. a Tuesday, and we went for the same on Wednesday. The variant offered was AMT SX(O) in Ranger Khaki-Black DT. The AMT is very well-tuned, and I could only feel a slight jerk when it increased from 1 to 2. Negligible jerkiness was felt on any other gear shift, up or down. It was a relief to us, as we had been dreading using a gearbox such as that on the Celerio for our drives. It wasn't something we were willing to accommodate. I might have risked going for the Altroz DCA. To assure myself that this won't change after a few thousand km, I also TD a well-run i10 Nios, and it was more or less a similar experience as the Exter. While my wife and I are strictly against a sunroof, we realised that SX seems to be the most VFM variant of the lot. Despite the fact that an S variant was readily available, we decided to upgrade our booking to SX DT AMT. The Sales guy at Ketan Hyundai, Jagtar Singh, is an excellent salesperson with sound customer service skills. He very clearly told me that, in this case, my delivery dates could be 2-4 months. But, over the next week, he worked to track the bookings at his showroom, and as soon as another customer cancelled an SX AMT, he immediately offered it to us. On evaluating SX v/s SX DT, we decided to go with the SX as waiting 2-3 months wasn't an option. We hope to bring this car home early next week.", 20th July 2023,hyundai-exter,Nagpur,90,439,Features/Controls/Displays (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

64, SlowDough , 19:41 ,BHPian,"I drove a Fronx Turbo Automatic and Exter Automatic on the Gurgaon Faridabad road. For those not from NCR: The road is a 4 lane one, with good long curves, straights, and speed limits higher than those inside the city. My intent was to check the highway worthiness of the cars and whether either one would make me smile through the driving experience, rather than the features or price. I know there isn't a direct comparison between the both, but I hope it will provide a good point of reference for what the Exter is really good for. For reference, I have a 2011 i10 1.1. Report: 1. Driving position: Exter's was upright, with a very good view of the surroundings and a visible bonnet. I am 5'10ish and I had raised the seat up to around half of it's limit. My left leg wasn't fully happy as the centre console felt a couple of cms wider than it hould have been, but not a big issue. The overall position felt good for navigating through the mountains and the cities. Fronx was more low and sporty in comparison. The steering has telescopic adjustment and I could use it to sit in a relaxed, laid back position, with my arms in a relaxed position. 3. Engine: We had chosen the 1.1 engine in the i10 very consciously. In the city, it is a joy, as I love to push small engines around. On the highway, it is too lethargic, and made me miss a 1.2. But Exter's 1.2 didn't feel like a satisfactory improvement. I still had to push it more than I expected, even from 40 to 80 kmph. In my i10, which is slower, I could at least enjoy seeing the rpm needle climb, but the fad around digital screens ensured that I didnt have that pleasure either. The Fronx, on the other hand, felt like it had just enough juice; neither too much that I wouldnt enjoy pushing it, nor too less that I would have to keep pushing it always. The lag is not much, and I felt that I was almost always in the power band or close enough to it at cruising speeds. 5. Gearbox: Exter's AMT is not as smooth or fastas I had hoped. From my previous test drives of AMTs, I had learned to shift up with my foot off the accelerator. But the gearbox was slow in the sense that I needed to lift off for a few more moments than I do when shifting in a manual, which sounds like an obvious thing for AMT users, but now I understand that this takes away from the sportiness, even if you can adapt to it. The paddle shifters were great, but the slow gearbox makes them useless for a sporty drive. Interestingly, I tried to shift through the gears with my foot off completely, both up and down, and then the gear shifts were incredibly smooth. The good part was that you can keep the gearbox in manual mode and drive with one hand; let the downshifts happen on their own, and use the right paddle for upshifts based on your discretion. The Fronx is another level ahead and most importantly, I enjoyed going through the gears. I have driven Hyundai DCTs, and this TC felt sporty enough for me to notice the difference much. The smoothness was acceptable. I also enjoyed the fact that if you lift off the accelerator in the auto mode, there is decent amount of engine breaking as the revvs go down gradually. I did not check this behavior in Exter. 7. Suspension: Compared to Nios i10, the Exter is much improved. It is softer, but not wobbly soft. The hard edge has gone away considerably. But the Fronx way again way better. I was uncomfortable in the Nios i10, comfortable in the Exter, but relatively oblivious to the road in the Fronx. At high speeds on curvy roads, in the Exter, my right foot was cautious and I braked early before the turns to slow down from my highway cruising speed. I could feel a bit of nervousness when I was close to triple digit speeds. But in the Fronx, I had to brake only because it was not my car. It felt stable and could take a lot more. Which means that on the actual highways and curvy roads, I will have to brake and accelerate significantly less in the Fronx. Both cars did well under a bit of panic braking too. 9. NVH: Fronx felt much more silent due to higher engine power and more ratios, therefore lower rpms, but the cabin itself felt decently well insulated. I couldn't hear the usual horns and autos cluttering about as much as I am used to. There wasn't enough traffic when I drove the Exter, but the engine itself gets relatively more stressed and louder. Both sound ok, but on the highway, I like having a better balance between the music and outside noise. Fronx's tyres are a bit loud though. Overall: My need is minimum 50% highway drive. Exter will do the job, but Fronx is significantly more enjoyable, has better dynamics, and is easier to push. Most importantly, if I cruise at 100 kmph in the Fronx, I think I will feel less tired than after cruising in the Exter at 80kmph. The Exter is not fun to push around, whereas the Fronx has all of the basic automotive requirements much more sorted. In the end, I'll say that the Exter felt like a small, practical, city MPV and the Fronx felt like a sporty crossover that is fairly enjoyable to drive.", 21st July 2023,hyundai-exter,Delhi,56,140,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive

66, teknophobia , 16:04 ,BHPian,"Test drove the Exter AMT today, my impression is generally positive. The engine and the AMT box are reasonably smooth. The car drives quite well in city traffic. It does feel somewhat underpowered though, doesn't have the same response as a WagonR 1.2, but then it is a heavier car with 6bhp less. The turning radius is adequately small, and the visibility is good. One thing that irked me was that the infotainment screen isn't designed for the driver to refer to comfortably. In both the civic and the WagonR, I can comfortably see the screen from my normal driving position, however, in the Exter, it feels too low and close.

I personally think the Punch looks much better due to it's cohesive design which doesn't feel like it has been derived from another car platform and stretched or modified (boxy proporations.etc) where ever possible to make it look like a mini SUV, unlike the Exter. Tata has come a long way in design now and their products definitely feel desirable from looks point of view. The only two things they are now lacking are Interior quality/attention to details and engine! Engine being a very weak link in their arsenal! If they can somehow get these two things right, I would personally prefer the TATAs over the Hyundai's despite lesser features which purely contribute towards wow factor (head's up display, dashcam.etc; for the price offcourse). Nothing to take away from the awesome product line from the Koreans, but they along with Suzuki lack effort towards crash safety (the costs of which they might be managing in giving the colossal features list).", 28th July 2023,hyundai-exter,Bangalore,36,163,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive
86, alok9345 , 13:38 ,BHPian,"Finally took the delivery of Fiery Red Exter SX MT. Some quick background : We are from a Tier 3 town and the Exter replaces our 12 year old Wagon R and primarily is going to be a highway car for my grandparents. We evaluated multiple cars (Baleno, Punch, Fronx, Exter, Nios) and our decision revolved around ease of ingress and egress (for 80+ yr olds), availability and ease of service and spares, safety features and importantly, it should cost us around 8L (yes, that's where it started !) How did we decide on Exter? Or rather dismissed others! Baleno - low hung seating was uncomfortable for my grandma to get into back seat. My brother in law owns one and I've had many chances to test this Punch - Loved the car, but the engine kept wanting for more and NVH levels weren't all that great. However, the final nail in the coffin has been my personal experience and multiple horror stories with Tata ASS. I just couldn't imagine my grandparents going through this hassle and even when Tata doesn't have a showroom or service center in our town. Fronx - Was upbeat about this higher up baleno and thought it could be a perfect balance for us, the pricing with respect to features was completely off and didn't make the cut for us. The Delta 1.2 MT would've costed us well upwards of 9L with lesser features than the Exter. The Zeta was most desirable, but upwards of 10L, didn't make sense. Styling was better though! Nios - Stil low hung, uncomfortable ingress/egress. Less space. Exter - Disappointed by Fronx pricing, quickly moved to pre-book the Exter. Styling was a hit and a miss for me, but I liked most bits of it. The pricing when launched was appetizable, with SX costing us around 9L on road. Exterior: Absolutely love the combination of red and black. I am glad they didn't offer the dual tone in red, else I would've been tempted for the alloys, but this single tone combination is absolutely smashing. I love the front of the car, the H DRLs are pretty cool, the grill comes out well and the overall styling from front and side looks good. However, all said and done, I don't think there's any way one can like the back of this car. It's even more polarizing in person. I am not even sure what were they thinking, but it's like it's been cut with a knife from the back. Will add some photos shortly. Writing this on the way back to Bangalore!! Interior: Another thing I love about Hyundai, is that with cheap plastic also, they'll get a better quality in knobs and buttons than a 20L tata. The combination of fabric and leather in seats feels good and breathable. They'll be easier to clean as well in my opinion. The white/beige/silver portion in the dashboard breaks the black monotony and the beige headliner alongwith sunroof adds a sense of space. There's ample legroom and seat depth in the back for a family with average height of 5.5-5.6"". Front seats are comfortable as well, with decent lumbar and thigh support, again for this avergae family height. Instrument cluster is pretty good for this price range and doesn't have 2000 things going on - plain and simple. MID is larger and crisper than my Nexon EV Max. Engine, Refinement and other nit-bits: Engine noise is quite noticeable. It also could be more noticeable to me due to my adjustment to my EV, but it's there, at all times. The noise was more noticeable initially, but it settled quite quickly post a long trip we had the next day. It does feel underpowered in higher gears (2nd and 3rd), in case you need a quick burst of power, say to overtake. The handling is typical hyundai - dead in the city, but weighs up on highways and at higher speeds, and that's when the feedback is pretty connected. The cruise works flawlessly, and probably better than my Nexon EV. It creeps up the power linearly, doesn't pressure the engine and works as it is supposed to, with decent fuel efficiency. Talking about fuel efficiency, could derive an average of ~16kmpl over ~400kms with 4 adults on the manual even with bad roads, construction related deviations, water logging and the infamous NH8 traffic. I would say it is pretty commendable for a new petrol car. Although I do miss the dynamic lines on the reverse camera, it doesn't hamper usage for this size of the car. Music system is loud and clear, but doesn't have the oomph that is now becoming standard in most cars, but maybe not this segment, i am unsure on the comparison here. I didn't miss the center armrest as this one is a manual and I have a habit of resting my hand on the gear lever. Biggest win: Grandma needs no assistance to get in or get out from this car. Overall: I don't think anything else is a more complete package, having said that, Punch wouldn't need to lose it's sleep because it is very much at par with definitely better styling, but let down by pathetic ASS. I'm not delving into my delivery experience, it was pretty much the usual business and we did find a connect with the owners and things went without a hitch. I did pay 5k for accessories and was surprised to know they don't have any at the moment and would be giving these later. I am going to go for the scoops! For everyone's benefit, don't let anyone sell you basic fabric floor mats - they come along with the car from the factory.

Panel gaps were not consistent and I can see some misalignments in bonnet area. Never see such sight in Hyundai car. May be problem with TD vehicle? - Quality in comparison with my Xcent feels like downgrade. Interior quality of my Xcent at 2014 beats Exter's hands down. - Freaking expensive for what it offers. - Exhilarating performance that my Xcent offered in 3rd gear is gone. The power is linear throughout and un-enthusiastic to drive. Better for mature and sedate drivers. - Transmission tunnel is huge compared to Xcent and it makes the 3rd passenger in the back sit in awkward knee position. This killed the joy of extra shoulder room it offers. - Base variant is too basic. It is like Hyundai has this variant only to show low sticker price and the lower variant can be best termed as ""Plain rice without any gravy or sides"". Positives: - Engine drivability has improved leaps and bounds. Riding in city traffic doesn't require much gear shifts. Drove in speeds of 35-30 kmph in 3rd gear without lugging. Which is not possible with my Xcent. - Gearshifts felt bit sticky compared to my Xcent which is butter smooth. Clutch is about the same as Xcent and is light to operate. - Steering is super light compared to Xcent and it makes the ride even more easier. - Tall and spacious compared to Xcent. Shoulder room has improved a lot. We were 5 in our Xcent yesterday. When we sit in the back of Xcent our shoulder rub with each other and we feel uncomfortable. But with Exter, shoulder room is great and same set of people who sat in Xcent said they felt good in the back of Exter. Hell, even I sat in the back for a while and it was better. May be they learned the space management from Tata cars? - Suspension is well sorted(in city) compared to my Xcent or even our Elite i20 which we sold recently. No more big thud in medium potholes. In fact, I intentionally rode over a small potholes and Exter didn't give the huge iconic Hyundai thud and although it was felt, it is not as bad as it was in our cars. Only Creta surpasses Exter in this aspect. Verdict? Well after TD, we felt good about Exter but after price revealed by SA, we were put-off. Decently specc-ed ""S"" variant costs about 8.4L OTR and for the same price, i20 Magna beats it hands down. And i20 has some good offers running. My brother decided to go ahead with i20 Magna, which apart from loosing additional 4 airbags, has a lot more to offer. Also, it looks & feel premium and spacious. Will I buy Exter? If it was for me, I would choose Exter once the discounts started rolling in, and only as a secondary car. I can't see it as highway cruiser and for the short highway run that we did, it didn't impressed me as a long distance cruiser. Overtaking vehicles is much better in my Xcent compared to Exter as Xcent offered the push needed to overtake where Exter is taking a linear approach in that. Which made us crawl behind vehicles more than we would have. If exter comes with Turbo-Petrol, well I might even consider it but for someone who strictly need a second car which see most of it's life in City, Exter is one of the option.

92, motorworks , 13:08 ,Senior - BHPian,"Had a quick look at the Exter which was displayed at the Phoenix mall, Bangalore. First up, going by all the pictures, videos and reviews i had seen so far, i had a feeling that the Exter would visually look bigger than the Punch due to its much more evident body cladding etc ( although in terms of actual dimensions both the cars are almost the same), but the Exter is actually no bigger in person and it is actually very diminutive in size. So in terms of road presence, the Exter is no better than the Punch ( i would rate the Punch a bit better actually ). Step inside and its all too familiar since the interiors are almost the same as the Nios. But the interior quality feels cheap, plastics dont feel durable, power window buttons etc feel too basic ( im not sure how these compare to the Nios). My Wife has an Elite i20 and i would say its 2 steps better than the Exter in terms of quality of materials used. So, the Exter is well kitted, is decently priced, but its not an alternative to an i20 or Baleno etc. Its an upgrade from cars like the Alto, Kwid, Celerio etc, but not otherwise.

This means that assuming they dispatch 10K Exter at least the first few months to show the world that it is selling as well as Punch, they will need to de-prioritize these numbers from other cars. So who is going to bear the brunt? I am assuming production will be cut from all models so that it doesn't look too bad overall. The obvious choice will be Grand I10 as they share the same assembly line. But their dispatches have already been too low and they can't risk reducing it too much. Venue is one car that they can make way for Exter. I am looking at a substantial drop in the dispatch of Venue for the next few months. Creta is the cash cow so they won't touch it. Verna is too new to disturb. Alcazar's numbers are already low. The next possibility is to cut the volume from I20. With Altroz CNG, Tata is hoping to dispatch more cars into showrooms than I20. Hyundai needs to ensure that it reads the market very carefully. Everyone including Hyundai, needs to learn from MSIL how meticulously they plan these things. This is what I had predicted in the Exter thread last month. Look at the dispatch of i10 Nios for the month of July. They cut it down by 50%! Even Venue got cut by 15%.

Throw from blower on position 1 is like 3 on my Swift and it's quiet. 3. Composed ride. Much better than my Swift and also better than the Ignis I drove some time back 4. Brakes had better bite and feel than the Verna 1.5T M!! 5. Irritating head nod in D mode. A lot more than the iMT I tried in the Sonet. 6. Head nod is worse in M mode with paddles if one wants to drive in a spirited manner. The lag between gears when upshifting was huge but going down greats was almost immediate. 7. I have no idea what horses hundai measures but the car just doesn't move under hard acceleration. My Swift feels like a Porsche compared to the Exter. 8.

119, 84.monsoon , 22:58 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Went car shopping for my mother yesterday and one the cars we checked was the Exter. The new car would be a replacement car for my mother's 9 year old Punto. She and her sister are going to be using the car. The specific use case for the car was only for short distance trips seated in the back of the vehicle, being chauffeur driven, using the ""Dial-a-Driver"" service, within the confines of the city. Both my mom and her elder sister are in there 70's. They have some level of back and knee pain and increasingly find it difficult to get inside and sit in the Punto. We checked out 3 cars:Magnite Wagon R Exter Because of the particular use case that my mom and aunt will use a car for, most of the fancy features will be of no use, such a steering mounted controls automatic up down windows electrically foldable and adjustable ORVMs, push button start, keyless entry etc. - as they would be chauffeur driven and sit in the back. They also wanted to strictly confine the budget to no more than 7 lakhs, as they think of a new car as a marginally wasteful expenditure. So we decided to look at the base variant of each car, as there would be hardly any difference in features, room or comfort between top-end and bottom-end variants from the perspective of rear seat occupants. The car had to have a comfortable back seat with plenty of Leg-room as both my mom and aunt are reasonably tall. The floor of the back of the car needed to be higher than normal hatchbacks and sedans, but not as high as a full size SUV or MPV like the Innova. It was important to be able to slide one's feet underneath the front seat comfortably also the depth of the floor from the the door sill point should not be too high, as both my mom and aunt find it difficult to lift their feet up and swing them over a high door sill to then get out of the car. The Magnite was the most mature SUV of a lot. It looked a size bigger than the other two, had big 16 inch wheels and 195 profile tyres and the leg room at the back was adequate. It had a commanding position for the driver and just felt more mature, like a car from a segment above. And this is probably also true specs-wise, as the car is a bit longer and wider then the other two. Even the base model priced at 5.99 Lakhs ex-showroom offered a good value package with 15 8nch wheels etc. The only issue with the Magnite was that the back door would open only about 70 degrees out. Plus the floor of the back seat was lower by about 3 inches from the bottom from the lower edge of the door opening. This made it more uncomfortable to get in and out of especially with the narrow door opening angle. Next we tried the Wagon R. The doors open really wide - almost 90 degrees. In the back there was almost no depression of the floor compared to the lower end of the door opening which made it really easy to slide one's legs in and out of the car when getting on or off. There was plenty of leg room and headroom. The high floor meant it was easy to walk into the Wagon R and get seated comfortably. The one drawback with the Wagon R was that the thigh support in the rear bench was pathetic - it is only as much as an auto rickshaw would have. Also the car looked much smaller than the others and the back bench was quite narrow and impossible for a third person, even a child, to sit. Also the base model had only a 1000cc, 3-cylinder engine that seemed very underpowered, on paper at least. The vehicle's stance was not at all confidence inspiring, with the tiny scooter-like 13 inch wheels and skimpy tyres in the base variant. We were not saving much for all these compromises - the price difference between this and the other two cars above is not much. I did not even dare to look up the crash test ratings of the Wagon-R, as I intuitively knew it would be pathetic. Yes, it may not be a big factor in slow City driving, yet the difference in safely levels between this and the other two cars would be very big to ignore. The other two cars can make a short highway trip to Pondicherry once in a year or so when they would visit their relative, but the Wagon R would be unfit for even such a small journey from a safety perspective. Next we checked out the Exter, which looked the best of the three IMO- It was clearly a more modern design, there was a huge amount of headroom in the back and leg room was generous. Under-thigh support was way better than the Wagon R, though not as good as the Magnite. The rear doors open quite wide, about 80 degrees, and the rear door openings was larger, minimising chances of your head hitting the roof as you got in or out. This is because of the unique rear door design - with the upper and outer part of the rear door opening sweeping away to the back side, versus cut-in towards the front side, which is the case on all other cars and SUVs. The only issue with the Exter was that, very similar to the Magnite, the rear floor was set much lower as compared to the bottom part of the door opening. Also the amount of space available at the corner between one's feet, the seat in front and the front-end of the rear door opening was cramped. This made it harder to get in and also to swing one's feet out when trying to exit the car. Also the seating position is lower than the Wagon R, making it less easy to walk into the car. One has to bend and lower oneself inside. The car has so much head room, I wonder why Hyundai decided to set the back seat lower and leave an enormous 6 - 8 inches of headroom, when they could have raised the seat a bit, made a relatively flat surface between the lower edge of door opening and the rest of the back floor. This would have made the Exter's back seat extremely comfortable. We now have two more cars to check out next weekend - the Tata Punch and Citroen C3. Both should be interesting options, given the specific criteria we are interested in.", 28th August 2023,hyundai-exter,Chennai,"2,219","9,796",Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

130, itsnotdeva , 22:07 ,Newbie,"Hello fellow BHPians! I haven't posted on the platform in a while, and I was looking for the right time to do so, so what better chance would I get than writing a review about my new car, the Hyundai Exter SX(O) DT AT after 500 kms of using it. My father and fellow BHPian gadadhar has already posted a few pics of the car on the thread https://https://www.team-bhp.com/for...ml#post5611497, I've been the one using it every day since taking delivery, and a felt a 500 km review would be the right thing to get me back and active on the platform. I've been daily driving a 2009 1.1 i10 Era for the last three years, which was given to me after my mother used it for 11 years, and I must say, it has been quite a change for me (in a great way). The good:Looks The looks of this car really do get a lot of attention. The 'H' shaped DRLs in the front and the boxy styling cues all over are something I really like, and it does get a fair bit of attention on the road, but that might also have something to do with it being a new car that Hyundai is advertising literally everywhere. Tall-boy design The SUV-like design and high seating position were two of the main reasons why we chose this car over the Maruti Suzuki Fronx. After using an SUV as our primary car for the last 10 years or so, my dad simply could not fathom the idea of getting a new car that was low-riding and low-seating. We were really impressed with the Fronx and its driving experience, but the low seating and high pricing for the 1.0L AT were both deal breakers for us. Loaded with tons of tech The infotainment system and the gauge cluster are shared across Hyundai cars in the range, and it really does feel nice getting such a nice feeling in the cabin, in this price bracket. Also, yes, it does have a sunroof, which seems to be something that everyone wants nowadays. It was never something that I was adamant about having in my car, but I'm not complaining and it does add to the airy feel of the already spacious cabin. Connected car features Hyundai offering their BlueLink features in this price bracket, with remote lock/unlock, vehicle tracking, valet mode and the option to monitor vehicle status from anywhere in the world is really nice. In our 2021 Fortuner, Toyota offers something similar with the Carot app, but the execution with Hyundai is FAR BETTER. This app actually looks and feels like something you'd want to use, unlike what Toyota offers, which, as my dad likes to say, reminds him of DOS prompt Spacious cabin I was pleasantly surprised by the space on offer in the cabin, especially in the back seat, for a car that is small in size. Family and friends have all praised this, and even had one person tell me that it felt more spacious in the back than his 2016 Creta (not sure if that's true). Refinement levels This might also be because I've been using an old i10 every day for a while now, but the refinement in this is fantastic. NVH levels are low, and I can feel the difference mainly while driving it on the highway, doing speeds of 80-90 kmph. Engine Nothing to rave about, but a very sorted engine-gearbox combo. The 1.2 is a smooth unit, with good punch in the mid-range. Ride quality The suspension on this is tuned nicely for Indian road conditions. It deals with our pothole-infested roads well, ironing out bumps and undulations with ease. It is slightly on the stiffer side, but not to the extent that it makes the ride uncomfortable. Paddle shifters The gearbox is something I've written about more below, but the paddles definitely need mentioning. They are a boon in this car. It really helps add to the whole driving experience, and every now and then when the gearbox doesn't respond the way I want it to, gear changes are just a click away. The paddles are quick to respond (quicker than our Fortuner) and do really change the way I use the car. Safety features Hyundai seems to offer the whole nine yards of safety, on paper at least. With 6 airbags as standard, 3-point seatbelts everywhere, ABS, EBD, TCS and all other 3-letter acronyms that you could possibly ever want, the safety suite on offer seems great. Will definitely have to wait till the Bharat NCAP tests for this model are done and the ratings come out though. Boot space A surprisingly large boot, which is also rather useful. The load lip is on the higher side, but the space in the boot can be utilized really well. Also, the car does come with a full-size spare tire, which is something not seen too often in new cars nowadays, I guess. The mehGearbox The gearbox is something that I do want to talk about. I was always sceptical about buying a car with an AMT, but after seeing reviews praising the transmission in this car, we went ahead and booked it, without having a test drive (because we couldn't actually, but that's a whole different story). The 5-speed AMT in this is good, but nothing great. Previously, I've only driven and gotten used to torque converters and DCTs, which never had much of a learning curve in figuring out how to get the car to respond the way I want it to, but with this, I have had to alter my style of driving. Sometimes, it is a little dim-witted, taking time to upshift and downshift, not being able to read my throttle inputs correctly, but that's also probably just me expecting it to pull the way our beast of a Fortuner does, with its 500Nm of torque and the 6-speed AT. Every day I spend with the car, I understand the characteristics of the gearbox better, but it is still something that needs mentioning. Auto Hill Hold Hyundai claims to offer this as a feature in the AMT Exter, but in my opinion, what they offer is not hill hold. From what I understand, hill hold is not supposed to let your car roll back EVEN A LITTLE BIT when you stop on a slope and let go of the brake, which is how it works on our Fortuner, but in the Exter, it is a bit of a faff. The car tends to roll back slightly, which is scary when you have someone right behind you in traffic. The workaround we have to use now, since there is no clutch, is to slot it into D with the handbrake on, let go of the brake, allow the revs to climb a little and then release the handbrake. Still causes the car to jerk and move forward, but it's better than having the car roll back and scare the driver behind. Scratchy plastics The interior has scratchy plastics everywhere, but I'm not expecting much else in this price bracket. Everything does feel solid, and will have to see how the interior plastics age over time. I've been happy with Hyundai so far, because my 14-year-old i10 still doesn't creak or squeak like you'd expect a 14-year-old car to. *touchwood* Speakers The infotainment system given is a really nice unit, which responds quickly and has a lot of features and customizations baked into it, but the speakers are a bit of a letdown. Just okay in the front seats, and borderline bad in the back. The system in the Fronx was a much better unit. Now moving on to how the car has been to use in general. City usage Using this car in the city has been fun. Stop-and-go traffic is a breeze with the AMT, and the sound insulation really helps you stay cut-off from the outside world. Gearbox takes a second to shift from 1st to 2nd in slow-moving traffic, and you can feel that shift taking place, but every other shift from there is butter smooth. Being an AMT, it doesn't have the 'creep' feature that regular ATs do, but when you let go of the brake, the car does move forward in traffic the way a manual car would if you were to release the clutch slowly, which is exactly what it feels like. I've been getting between 13-15 kmpl in the city, with a relatively light right foot and proper stop-and-go traffic. Highway usage Highway usage has been nice in this car. Being a new engine, I haven't tried pushing the car, but the power feels adequate. My daily commute to work gets me on NICE Road and the Bangalore-Mysore Expressway, and the car feels comfortable to drive at highway speeds. I generally turn on cruise control, set it to 85-90 kmph and let the car do its thing. NVH levels being low make sure that you're fresh and fine even after a long drive. I don't think this is a car I'd recommend for enthusiastic driving, owing to its skinny tyres, tall-boy design and just adequate engine. If a sporty drive is what you're in the market for, the 1.0 Fronx or the other 1.0 Turbo cars that Hyundai offer should be more to your liking. On highways, I've been getting between 16-20 kmpl, depending on the traffic and how long I can use the cruise control for. Pictures: Haven't had the opportunity to really take pictures of the car, but here are the few that I have taken so far: Here's my mom and I taking delivery of our cute Exter The Exter parked along with my trusty 2009 i10 Era 1.1 A few more pics from day 1 with the car A few photos I took on an evening where the sky looked like a paid actor The 'H' shaped DRLs really do help the car stand out with its looks. This particular shot is now my wallpaper simply because of how good it ended up looking A shot of the interior and the MID showing the mileage I've managed to get on my highway runs With a relatives new Fronx 1.0 AT Special thanks to Advaith Hyundai, Residency Road, Bangalore for ensuring that our entire delivery process was butter smooth, right from the booking to the day we collected the car. All in all, we're extremely happy with the purchase and I will definitely keep all of you here posted about the car and how everything goes during the first service and after.

With the tray in place it is actually 321 litres i.e. approx. 12% less (Courtesy MotorInc ""Hyundai Exter First Drive Impressions"") So going by same the logic, Exter's published boot space of 391 less 12% would be around 344 litres.

144, Chewbacca , 12:27 ,BHPian,"Exter with it's published GC of 185 mm was big surprise to me. No other tall-boy in the hatchback category has ever offered so much. This combined with a superior AMT and loaded features makes it a lot more desirable. An office colleague of mine showed me his new Exter. This was a good opportunity for me to check the GC as I know for sure that all hatchbacks and some sedans of Hyundai have a softer suspension, this reduces the GC significantly when car is loaded, they all scrape the underbelly over ramps / speed-bumps when 3 or more people are seated. I asked 3 other colleagues to occupy the rear bench, nobody in the front. Then I checked the reduction in the gap over the rear wheel tires with the arch, it was significant, approx. 2 inches (50 mm) less than what it was when unladen!! Even the car's side profile looked stooped down at the rear. This meant the rear suspension is indeed soft. Now my concern is about the stability of tall-boy Exter while driving on curvy roads at speeds 50~60 Kmph when it is almost loaded to capacity. A soft suspension for tall-boy is a sure shot recipe for a disaster. I'm wondering how this passed off in Hyundai's safety test? What use are those 6 air-bags if dynamics of the car itself is suspect ? Not sure if I can get an opportunity to test drive on curvy road at 50 Kmph with 2 or 3 guys seated at the back. I hope some owners can run this test and let us know their thoughts?

Strangely my SA was asking me to buy the floor mats while they are included as per the brochure. Funnily, i saw the floor mats in the boot while doing the PDI.

152, noopster1008 , 20:34 ,BHPian,"Dear all, Today I took my Exter (SX AMT) to its first highway run (Jaipur to Delhi on Delhi Mumbai Expressway). It exceeded my expectation in terms of high speed, acceleration, NVH and mileage too. I got 20.3 kmpl for first 80kms where I drove at 80kmph max speed. Then on the Expressway, I maintained consistent 100-110 kmph, the mileage I got was 17.7 kmpl. Regarding acceleration, reaching 0 to 100 kmph was reasonably OK. Not going into 0 to 100 timing, it is as good as other cars. My other car is Skoda Rapid 1.6 TDI which is a different beast altogether. But when you drive 'normally', this modest Exter is all the same. You will feel the difference only when you want to reach Delhi from Jaipur in 2 hrs. Hope you all understand what I mean Regarding NVH, there is no comparison of 1.2P and Rapid's 1.6D. All I want to say is - God bless Petrol engines. High speed stability was good, no nervousness at all. I used cruise control at 110 kmph for apprx 400 kms (both side). High seating position gives good view. After 650kms drive in one day I am not feeling tired at all. Speaker quality is average at best. I am more than happy with the Exter and I highly recommend it to be used as a primary city car as well as a car that can be used for highway runs of 500kms in a day.

So I decided to go with SX(O) Petrol Manual Ranger Khaki color. I got the allotment in about 25 days from the booking. Just when the car was expected to reach the dealership, my better half decided against the ranger khakhi color because of all black interiors. So, changed the color to Grey on 31/8/2023.

Took a test drive today and I can share my observation: Quote: Originally Posted by itsnotdeva The car tends to roll back slightly, which is scary when you have someone right behind you in traffic. The workaround we have to use now, since there is no clutch, is to slot it into D with the handbrake on, let go of the brake, allow the revs to climb a little and then release the handbrake. Still causes the car to jerk and move forward, but it's better than having the car roll back and scare the driver behind. I tried this specific thing on a ~40 degree grade with 4 people on board. The car did stay put after leaving the brake pedal and to my surprise, it crept forward after the HOLD got disengaged without any accelerator input on that incline. I would suggest you to get it checked at A.S.S., it shouldn't roll back. Quote: Originally Posted by itsnotdeva City usage Using this car in the city has been fun.

Any accessories you got in addition? How's the car to drive in city? I got my car on Friday under the dramatic conditions of Bangalore bandh. The delivery experience was good and fast. I cannot comment completely as it was not a normal day and we had some strict timelines on taking the delivery of the car. The staff were very polite and were accommodating. We have been given a picture frame with a picture of us taking the delivery of the vehicle shortly after the event. I have taken the insurance from outside and Tata AIG costed me INR 32k after getting Cibil hased discount. The process was completely online and easy enough. The extended warranty was only for the 4th year. I was told that it is available until 7 years and can be bought once this expires. I paid the catalogue price for the SOT. I have returned most of the basic accessories as I did not feel any worth in the pillows and the car care kit. I could not return the scuff plate as it was already affixed sans my permission. I see their worth now as they indeed protect the paint in the area. Apart from those, I have opted for the car cover at 2k INR, door visors at INR 1599, Mud flaps as they were not a part of the package at INR 350, The bumper protector at INR 1699. The bumper protectors feel premium and add to the look of the vehicle. The car cover seems reasonably priced as I was unable to find one in Amazon for a good price. they costed about INR 8k in total. The drive is good. It doesn't corner like the Jazz but feels a little SUVish to me. Having said that, the drive on the straight line is really good. The suspension is better than my expectation from a vehicle at this price point. I drove it on the RV road and I did not feel the uneven concrete road much and the suspension felt supple. The pickup is decent enough for the vehicle of this weight (996 KG). I feel that there is a little hesitation in shifting from the 1st to 2nd and less from 2nd to 3rd. After 3rd, the shifts are seamless. Overall, the experience is far better than the test drive vehicle.

According to Hyundai, the top-spec variants of the Exter are witnessing a higher demand. Initially, the carmaker was building 6,000 units per month and has now increased this number to 8,000 units. Hyundai's Chennai factory also serves export markets. Media reports suggest that the carmaker is now diverting some of the volumes meant for exports to cater to the domestic demand. Production capacity is likely to be increased further sometime next year. The Exter was launched in July this year at a starting price of Rs 5.99 lakh (ex-showroom). It is available in 5 variants: EX, S, SX, SX(O) and SX(O) Connect. Powering the Hyundai Exter is a 1.2-litre 4-cylinder petrol engine producing 83 BHP and 114 Nm when running on petrol. With CNG, the power drops to 69 BHP and 95.2 Nm. The petrol version of the SUV comes with the choice of either a 5-speed manual gearbox or an AMT, while the CNG variant gets the manual transmission as standard.

Got the first service done day before yesterday and the only issue was slightly pulling left. While driving back home from service center, I received a call, and I answered it using the steering controls and the call was received. I was able to hear the voice of caller, but the caller was not able to hear me. The call was disconnected, and I called back. But still the other end was not able to hear me. I tired recalling that there were numerous calls I received in this 1 month and never faced this issue and there was nothing done with the car audio in the service. Then how come suddenly this issue crop up. After thinking for quite a few minutes, I realized that I was not using the Car Play this time which I was earlier. I stopped the car, connected the Car Play and called a number and yes, it was working properly. I was able to talk and hear using the car stereo. So, without Car Play connected, I'm not able to hear the person on the other side on phone call. Am I missing some setting in the ICE? I'm sure it should not be this way.

203, arpirocks , 08:50 ,BHPian,"I booked an Exter SX AMT yesterday! The car is in stock, so I'm hoping to drive it home within a week. Why Exter? We were looking for a small city car for my wife with a 7-9L budget, and these were the ones that made the final cut (in the sequence that our selection process proceeded) P.S. All the opinions mentioned below are from my wife's perspective Maruti Spresso - The plan was to go with a tiny car, and we really like this one. Some of the things we didn't enjoy were the lack of power steering, which made the car difficult to drive, especially in turns where the steering didn't autocorrect. Poorly made interiors Maruti Ignis - After we ruled out Spresso, the next default choice imposed on us by Maruti/Nexa SA was Ignis. To be honest, the car is enjoyable to drive, and for some reason, the AMT feels more refined. However, in the end, the ride and interior quality were not up to level with vehicles like the i10. We put this option on hold and returned to the market. Quote: A general comment about Maruti - all of their Test-Drive vehicles are in total disarray. Rattling noises, interior damage, jerks, and so on. How somebody is supposed to ""experience"" such a test drive and then decide to buy the car is beyond me, Maruti! Given the strong sales, perhaps they don't give a damn. Grand i10 Nios - After driving a lot of Marutis, you're bound to like this one. We enjoyed the car because it drives well and has more features than the Ignis. It proved to be a more VFM car with a little bit more expense. We felt the AMT was more refined than Maruti engines; we experienced fewer jerks. We eventually settled on the i10 Nios Sportz AMT version, which was roughly 9.5L on the road., Exter - As an SUV, this car did not initially pique my wife's interest, as she considered it to be outside the ""small-car"" category. During our visit to the Hyundai showroom for the final i10 discussion, my wife decided to spend her free time inside Exter while the SA was organising the i10 paperwork. We found the car to be attractive, not overly large, and built on the i10 platform, which guarantees that it is a small ca (at least on paper.) What's more, the Exter Base (S) AMT came with a tonne of features out of the box. We weren't too interested in the higher variants and their features (auto A/C, sunroof, tilt steering, cruise control, etc.) because this wasn't going to be our daily driver. The Exter S AMT option was chosen. According to Hyundai SA, there was a three to five month wait, and since Hyundai has increased Exter's production, the delivery could occur sooner. Booking Experience From S -> SX A few days ago, I received a message from the SA informing me that a cancellation had made the White SX variant available in stock. As previously stated, we didn't initially want the SX variant, but availability later played a role. Also, after seeing some reviews on YouTube and reading this Team-BHP thread on Exter, I decided to upgrade. Insurance The Hyundai price list's initial insurance quote, which was 55k for an 8.7L Ex-Showroom, was far too expensive. Before going to Hyundai for the booking, I decided to contact a couple of known insurance people and get some quotes that were half of what Hyundai was offering. During the booking, I told the SA that I want to opt for self-insurance. He was keen to know what quotation I am getting from market and to my surprise, he decided to match it! It was one hassle less and moreover less on-road price for us. Win-Win. The overall booking experience was super smooth. The Hyundai folks were very polite and were very helpful in understanding everything related to car and the booking process, accessories, pricing etc. Now waiting for all the formalities to complete!

You have to be in D mode. 2 - When in D mode and going uphill, if you press the brake momentarily where the car doesn't stop completely and let go, it DOES ROLL BACK. 3 - Next, I went to same slope and pressed the brake completely where the car completely comes to an halt and let go of the breaks, the car DOES NOT ROLL BACK.

Unfortunately could not test the gear shift quality using paddle shifters. 2) Rear seat space was decent. I could see the bonnet from my driving position. 3) Quality of interiors was decent although did not feel as premium as i20. I think the interiors are a direct copy of Grand i10. 4) Infotainment system was good but it has wired Android Auto / Apple car play. There was an in-built navigation application but I do not think we will be using that due to our preference for google maps. 5) The fuel efficiency of the test drive vehicle was 6.1kmpl. We were told to expect around 10kmpl within the city. 6) Overall, I did not find any major negatives in the car. Although from a price perspective, I think the SX version makes more sense for us.

233, noopster1008 , 21:44 ,BHPian,"I think I can comment on this as I own Exter AMT and completed 9500kms in 4 months. Have travelled from Jaipur to Katra (850 kms) in one go and came back same way. The drive or the car did not give me any fatigue. I was tired but not because of driving Exter. Well, sitting idle for 15 hrs is tiring you know. Let me tell you that it is really an under rated car. I drove it at some really high speeds. I am frequently driving from Jaipur to Delhi via DV Expressway. I use CC at 110 kmph. Few pros and cons - 1. Pros - High seating position - silent 4 cylinder petrol engine (till 90 kmph then started some mild noise but not intrusive) - AMT is better than all other options. - if you are not really racing then it is reasonable quick. - Back seat space is surprisingly good - paddle shifters - Steering is better than Brezza 2. Cons - 1.2 L engine, not good enough for some - AMT, not as good as DCT But in the segment at the given price, it is really a good product. Specially, city drives are smooth, silent and quick. Now, comparing to Brezza 1.5 L - offcourse, Exter will lag a bit but Brezza will also leave you a bit 'Unsatisfied' if you are really looking for some FUN factor. Interior quality is definitely a grade below Exter. Interior space is almost similar, I feel back seat leg room is better in Exter. Single line highway drive comparison - Brezza is 20% better but both cars won't satisfy you totally if you are looking for FUN. So, difference of 300CC (1.2 Vs 1.5) will be there but if I have to choose again, I will definitely go for Exter AMT again (may be with Red color next time after Khaki Green of my present car).

235, TheZenGuy06 , 23:01 ,Newbie,"Bought my Exter SX AMT in Atlas White in October 2023 and have completed 2500 km. Want to share my thoughts behind the purchase and my ownership experience so far. Cars considered Being a new driver, I was very clear that I wanted to buy an SUVish vehicle. I felt more comfortable in the driving class if the car bonnet was visible to me . I considered Brezza, Fronx, Punch before zeroing in on Exter. The main reasons to reject other cars are the following: 1. Maruti Suzuki Brezza: Felt too big and intimidating, which was exacerbated by the incidence where the Maruti salesperson was not able to U-turn the vehicle in front of my society gate in one go. Moreover, paying a premium that MS charges for the torque converter did not seem reasonable to me. 2. Maruti Suzuki Fronx: Delta / Delta+ variants were lacking features and the Turbo variants were again too expensive. Also, despite several followups, the sales guy did not arrange for a test drive and kept on postponing . Perhaps others have had a good experience in Nexa showrooms. I did not feel that. 3. Tata Punch: I fell in love with Punch and did consider it strongly. However, went for Exter due to these particular issues with Punch:Weird door locks. They might be safer in case an emergency exit is needed, but I have a very energetic toddler who would have opened the doors very easily. No true TPMS. For me TPMS was a big priority. Punch has introduced indirect TPMS which only reports if the tyre pressure in any of the tyres is lower than the set values. Doesn't even say which tyre. I've heard more horror stories about the Tata QC than Tata ASS. Did not want the headache. Only two airbags on offer. No three point seatbelt for the middle passanger on the rear seat. No hill hold assist. During my TD the car rolled down aggressively on my society parking slope. Also, the creep speed of Punch felt faster than Exter which I felt could become a problem in bumper to bumper traffic. Ownership review As mentioned earlier, I've completed nearly 2500 km on my Exter. I've driven it in the city in bumper to bumper traffic, on highways and on western ghats. First service (only checkup and cleaning) was done at around 1500 km which was free of any issues. My experience has been really delightful and I haven't faced any issues so far. I agree with some other posts that Exter is an underrated car. Here are some of my key observations: 1. The AMT is very smooth. While I haven't driven any TC or CVT transmissions, I do not feel any delays / jerks in the AMT (except a slight delay when it moves from first to second gear). The paddle shifters are also useful. I've used them a handful of times on hills and on highway, and they served their purpose well. 2. The engine is absolutely silent and refined. There is slight noise about 90kmph but I haven't feel any vibrations while driving the car so far. 3. Again, about the engine, the pickup is reasonably good. Reaching 100kmph is fairly quick. 4. There is minimal body roll and the car feels very stable and confidence inspiring, be it on the hairpin bends on hills or on the highways. I am not sure if this is due to ESC/VSM system kicking in. It may have also helped that my Exter came with CEAT SecuraDrive tyres and not JK tyres. 5. The suspension is certainly on the softer side, but it can take some abuse. I drove it on a largely broken concrete road on hills and it handled it really well. While taking on the road bumps, one needs to keep the speed slow, otherwise the suspension bounces aggressively and rear passengers feel it. I also faced the suspension bottoming out a handful of times - but it wasn't too aggressive. 6. The car is spacious. I've mostly driven with 5 people + 1 kid in the car, and 200 km stretches in one go - but the rear passengers (elderly parents) always felt comfortable in the back. The boot space is also good and I can manage 1 week of luggage for 5 people in the boot. 7. Fuel efficiency I've been seeing: City 10-12 kmpl, Hills 13-15 kmpl, Highways 18-22 kmpl. I've observed that the upshifts are delayed in the City and on the hills, and currently I am experimenting with the paddle shifters to time my upshifts and thus improve the economy. I am also hoping that the mileage increases after the second (real) service. Things I wish were available in Exter 1. Bigger tyres. While the current 15"" are OK, I feel 16"" rims would have enhanced the appeal of the car. 2. Safety rating announcement for my peace of mind. I am hoping that Exter gets good BNCAP rating. The car definitely feels well built. 3. Slightly firmer suspension would be welcome. 4. Stronger headlamps. While the stock headlamps do serve the purpose, in pitch dark I did feel the need for better illumination. Perhaps I can fix this by replacing the stock lamp with aftermarket units. So far I have been very satisfied my purchase, and I wish to keep the car for a longish duration. I hope this experience helps someone in their purchase decision, like tons of other reviews on TBHP that've helped me.", 11th January 2024,hyundai-exter,Bangalore,5,10,Climate Control - Heating & Cooling (broken or difficult to use),Very Positive

It was similar to the short whistles a pressure cooker gives just before a long continues whistle. My neighbor said it is normal from a small petrol engine. I have driven the car apprx 8000km since then. No issue at all. Can any one throw some light on this ? Is it really a normal sound from small petrol engines ? My other cars are Diesel (Rapid, Innova) and they have many other noises coming off the engines but not like this from the exhaust.

240, sahsriv , 16:27 ,Newbie,"Hi, it is a long cherished dream to be part of this elite group happy it got coincided with my new Exter purchase, hence quite elated and delighted to write my first post in terms of ownership and feedback. I took delivery of car on 23rd December and been in lot of travel ever since. I am now happy to share my buying experience, modifications made and vehicle performance so far. Background It has been more than 30 years of driving experience in India and abroad and owned several cars and varied experience in different conditions. Still remember my first car Ambassdor in 1990 bought after my wedding and has good memories. Cut to present, in November, my family and friends were totally surprised when I decided to replace my 5 year old, faithful Creta (1.4 Diesel) by a smaller vehicle. Reason being, my usage dropped to 5K KM/year, difficult to drive in Bangalore city conditions and reduced family size (it is now just two of us). My priority was to buy a vehicle with ground clearance of 180 mm, high reliability, good service and easy to drive in city and highways. vehicles considered 1. Fronx / Baleno 2. Punch 3. Magnite 4. Exter (AMT and Manual) The showroom experience in South Bangalore with all the dealers (Maruti, Nissan and TATA) except Hyundai (Blue Hyundai, Basavanagudi) was very poor (perhaps due to year end, they had lot of enquiries to attend and could give only price list and asked us to come back later) We could only manage to see these vehicles in the showroom, while the display car of Punch had issues like doors not opening properly etc and in Fronx my wife did not like the back seat comfort, boot space and base model had only very minimal features and we were out of budget for higher variants. It was a refreshing change with Blue Hyundai, called them up first and then visited them. They arranged for my Creta valuation instantly, then offered test drive of Exter top end variant AMT (my wife and daughter also accompanied me). Except for the initial sluggish pick up, we found the vehicle ticking all the boxes of our requirements. We got a good deal for our Creta (after verifying valuations in Cars 24 and Spinneys) and also promised to deliver Exter before 31st December provided we gave them few options on the variants. The Sales person was very nice and professional, made our life easier by allowing us to pay for only basic car value and registration cost, rest said it will be our prerogative to decide. This helped us big time in bringing the cost of vehicle down by 60K approx (Insurance, optional accessories etc.) Hence we agreed and booked the S model AMT (other options given SX MT DT and SX Auto) on 7th December since getting an automatic at less than 10 Lakhs sounded very attractive and not much to pay additionally after selling off of our Creta to them. On 11th Dec I got a call from Sales guy stating that they can get an SX MT DT (white n black) in a weeks time, although we had preferred the Auto, still felt the variant is value for money (and manual isnt that hard to drive), hence confirmed the same. The vehicle arrived on 15th in Bangalore, checked VIN, did PDI, paid balance money and vehicle got registered by 20th December. Opted for only mud flap, edge guard, tyre valve cap and 3 M Teflon coating package (3 times in 1.5 years with 6 months interval) as optional items. The vehicle cost worked out as follows: Basic cost + Registration (BLR) : 9.66 Insurance : .24 Extra fittings : .07 Modification : .18 (Tyres, headlight and cabin lights) Total 10.15 L on road Took delivery of car on 23rd December with my family present and was an another memorable day for us. Did the following modifications the same day: 1. Millivision, Lalbagh road - Exchanged stock tyres for Yokohoma earth1 185/65/R15, took stock tyres for 3000 each and new tyre at 5800 each. 2. Konark, Jayanagar - Replaced stock head lamps with 50 W 4300K OSRAM LED headlights, cost 6500/-, replaced all cabin lights with Blaupunkt LEDs, paid Rs 600. 3. Car cover - Rs 1300/- from Amazon 4. GFX long life mats bought from co distributor (Siddi Automotive) good quality at attractive price of Rs 2700/- We along with our friend in 2 cars did an 1000 km holiday trip to Koppa (base location and stayed in a 300 year old house) and covered udupi, Sringeri and Agumbe. Overall vehicle performed nicely and was a delight to drive. Positives 1. Good visibility, silent and refined engine, easy clutch and gear shifts, pleasure to drive 2. Decent boot space, comfortable ride for 4 people, excellent AC, cools in an instant 3. Stock audio system was ok for our needs and navigation system worked very well 4. Got mileage of about 15.8 involving mostly highway driving (with lot of ghat sections) with AC on for most part. Not so good part 1. Having driven a diesel Creta earlier, was longing for bit more power, something I need to get used to. 2. Post 90+ km speed, wind noise intrudes into the cabin and since I opted for hard tyres, it also added to the noise part. 3. Horn - Already pointed out by many, needs change 4. While suspension is good in lower speeds, not so in higher speeds, especially if we hit a pot hole or speed breaker accidentally. it would been nicer to have a slightly harder suspension. 4. Arm rest sorely missed, not sure why these basics are not provided 5. Not sure why basic items like mud flaps arent provided, need to pay for it. Hill assist function - Had an incident while taking a steep climb on a hairpin bend (with 3 people on board), the vehicle in the front was an Ertiga, suddenly stopped and there were lot of vehicles behind me. I applied the brakes and when I tried to move, vehicle did slip behind, had to use hand brake and move forward. The car manual says that Hill Assist works for 2 or 3 secs only, need to try this out another time. the good part is, the vehicle did well to negotiate all the hairpin bends nicely (had heavy traffic and could take these bends mostly in 2nd gear) Post my trip, planning to do sound damping shortly to reduce wind and road noise, thanks to the 94 page thread in Team Bhp, was very useful, finalised the vendor and will share experience on the outcome.

Regarding the discount part, nothing offered since was told still Exter has lot of waiting period, only thing they said is about getting the vehicle delivered in December. Also the threat of price increase in Jan (so far I guess it is still not happened). Hence had no power to negotiate, even on accessories, dealer refused to provide discount. About tyre upgrade: Feedback Nice road grip and cornering is good, takes bad roads nicely (took some interior routes in villages in and around Koppa) and comfort levels are good in general (unable to comment if this is better than stock tyres since upgraded on day 1). On the down side, at higher speed with softer suspension, it is bit noiser and hitting potholes or speed breakers accidentally is bit unsettling. Not sure if softer tyres would perform anything better in respect of ride and handling. (I chose harder tyres - for longer life, longer period of vehicle remaining idle, lesser punctures, performs better in broken / kutcha roads) Stiff steering at rest, TPMS differences of 2 PSI between car and tyre dealer, not sure because of tyre upgrade or gauage differences.

246, rajakumar , 15:19 ,BHPian,"I have a minor issue with my Exter. Recently I started getting low pressure TPMS warning on the instrument cluster. I believe the warning started off as tyre pressure dropped below 30psi on a cold morning. I had kept the tyre pressure at 32psi earlier. Post the warning I increased the tyre pressure to 35psi and have driven around ~50 kms. Still I keep getting the low pressure warning. Even after keeping the tyre pressure at 35psi, TPMS reports as 32 or 31. I guess there could be some discrepancy in the measures. However I could not get the warning go away. Is there way to reset this? What is the low point on which TPMS triggers low pressure warning?", 2nd February 2024,hyundai-exter,Bangalore,201,32,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Negative

254, sahsriv , 12:15 ,Newbie,"Thank you Lemedico. You are right, I did plan that way, however changed my decision based on a combination of factors, concerning my priority of using public transport (metro) in city primarily, while personal vehicle for running upto 300 kms on highways. Added factors of cost and quicker delivery (was told auto variants have longer waiting periods). Lastly when I test drove the automatic, wasnt very impressed, hence despite the comfort and usefulness, my heart settled for manual transmission.", 8th February 2024,hyundai-exter,Bangalore,3,22,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Neutral

You have exactly the same problem that I face in my Ford Aspire. Due a slightly steeper slope towards the back I immediately start to have a lower back pain. And I realised that the problem is not the seat but me since most other folks who drive it have no complaints. I spent lot on back rests and seat positions but nothing worked long term. What eventually helped is a basic cylindrical towel roll. Roll a big towel and tuck it just above your hips. If your car seat has height adjustment then raising the height is another option that should lower the angle and might be helpful. My problem was so bad that I had thought multiple times to sell off the car only due to the back pain. Hopefully you will not get to that situation due to height adjustment option along with a softer suspension setup.

It is so comfortable that every day I am thinking of selling it off but I love everything else about Exter. I went to a car decor shop and asked them if anything can be done. They added a 2 inches thick thermocol sheet at the bottom of the seat to lift it up slightly at the area where it was more sloped. The slope angle has reduced now. And this has helped a lot. Though it's not 100% solve but it's much more comfortable now than before. I have even done a 300 km trip after these changes comfortably.

259, TheMbaCarGuy , 12:53 ,Newbie,"Purchase and Initial Experience of Exter SX AMT - 500 kms ownership I was in-market to buy my first car - preferably an automatic. I had budgeted 10 lakhs for the purchase with some wiggle room. Majority driving is supposed to happen in the city, with a once a month weekend trip (~500 kms). Key options considered were Baleno - While overall car is really great (sales numbers speak) - the front windscreen rake seemed slightly too much as I am used to driving my fathers Kia Sonet. At its minimum the distance between touch screen and IRVM must be ~7 inches. Plus generally low on features Swift - Smaller feeling owing to all black interiors and plus a facelift is expected Swift Dzire - Had owned and driven one as a family car, not so feature rich Honda Amaze - rear seating was cramped with roof being steeply sloping (me and my wife both are 510 with wide built. I10 - Felt small and low on headroom and sense of space I20 - Close second in choice , but rupee to rupee value comparison against Exter took it down Exter - Finally chose owing to reasons explained in post I had always loved tall boy designs, loved Wagon R / Santro / Yeti , so Exter felt nice to be in. Hyundais great sales / customer service made the choice easier. Review is with Exter SX AMT Exterior - Well the car looks slightly awkward with tall boxy proportions, relatively narrow track and skinny tyres. While I did not find any mini / micro / nano SUV bits ; the flared wheel arches, upright C pillar and squared front and rear substantiate the look. Longish rear window and convex bulge on roof - make the car look bigger and established. Front H DRLs and low set headlamps do the job well and after looking at the new Creta - the design language seems to be more clear. Rear looks are basic, with some piano black elements making it somewhat interesting. Overall the car has great road presence and doesnt feel small or insignificant. Interiors - The cabin is very well laid out. The dashboard is picked up from i10 / Aura. Overall fit-finish is really good quality, gaps are consistent and acceptable. Most of the plastic is hard, but nothing low quality. Door panels have all plastic components - no fabric inserts anywhere, neither the buttons are illuminated. Overall glass area is really good, and the light coloured headliner improves space perception. The headroom is tremendous, 6 footers sitting in both the front and rear seat will be well catered. Rear roof is scooped from inside giving an outrageous amount of headroom. Seats are very well padded and provide good support ; both rear and front seats.The 8 infotainment display is functional and does a good job. Rear AC vents are well performing. The cabin comes with 4 charging sockets (2x USB A + 2x USB C) and a wireless charging pad. Drive - Adjustable seat and steering (rake) give great view of the road. Edges of the bonnet are visible , thus making city driving a breeze. Steering and speedo cluster is well laid. All digital for speedo and tacho are very well readable. MID gives all important information such as TPMS, economy, trip computers and general menu to control the screen colours and behaviour. The steering is light in urban setup and weighs up well on highways. The paddle shifters are handy in overtake situations, but not essential. MInd well though the shifters don't really shift till it's reasonably good time (speed+throttle+load). While cornering the body roll is well within control. Suspension is softly sprung and irons most of the bumps and potholes. On highway speeds (90+) there is no floating feel or oscillations. The engine likes to stay calm and composed and absolutely hates any sporty or spirited inputs. If you put your foot down doing say 50 kmph in 5th gear - there is a whole 1 second lag, car will drop 2 or 3 gears and will try to respond. Is it sporty or exciting, no - will get the job done on city or highway - absolutely yes. In the first 500 Kms drive - fuel efficiency is around 13-14 KMPL - slightly lower than expected. Closing - Car is great choice for first vehicle with city driving focus and occasional outings. Car is great for 4 pax and gives all the features needed with sweeteners like sunroof. 6 Airbags, ABS/EBD/ESC are peace of mind items , with G-NCAP and B-NCAP yet to be tested. Boot space is good but has a slightly higher loading lip.", 17th March 2024,hyundai-exter,Mumbai,2,9,"Brakes, Wheels or Tires",Very Positive
