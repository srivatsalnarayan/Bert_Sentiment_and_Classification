1, Tushar , 14:50 ,Senior - BHPian," Slow in responding to market trends - it's not a statement that'd make you think of Maruti Suzuki. Despite having nearly half of the Indian automobile market, since the last 4 - 5 years, Maruti has been quick to bring out new models, technologies and options. However, the giant has been surprisingly late to the compact SUV space. All these years while the EcoSport & Duster raked in the moolah, Maruti could do nothing, but frown & watch from the sidelines. Its compact SUV was still years away. Truly shocking how Maruti (& Hyundai) were unprepared for the country's SUV craze. A lot of models and updates from rivals later, Maruti Suzuki has finally launched its first contender for the sub-4 meter SUV segment; though late to the game, this is a nightmare come true for its competitors. After successfully reviving the Baleno brand, Maruti decided to continue with the ""throwback nomenclature"" of reviving model names of the past, christening its baby SUV - Vitara Brezza. Brezza is an Italian word for breeze, but marketing aside, this is nothing more than an intelligent name-play. The Grand Vitara was far from Maruti's best-selling model, yet the name ""Vitara"" still has recall value in the Indian car buyer's mind as an SUV. It was an expensive SUV too, so there is some premiumness around the nameplate. Since the Grand Vitara was a non-seller anyway, using its name on a cheaper mass market product has no negative repercussions. The Vitara Brezza has already driven in 20,000+ bookings (many of which were placed without so much as a test-drive!) and production has been increased from the original 80,000 to 1,00,000 units per annum. In fact, soon after the Vitara Brezza's launch, Ford dropped prices of the EcoSport by Rs. 53,000 to 1,12,300 (depending on the variant). God bless competition . As Mr. Randhir Singh Kalsi (executive marketing and sales director - MSIL) said, ""Unchi is the new lambi."" i.e. SUVs today enjoy the same status & desirability as long sedans did at one time. Codenamed 'YBA', the Vitara Brezza is based on Suzuki's global C-platform, which it shares with the full-sized Vitara. Nope, it's not based on the new Baleno platform as work on the Vitara Brezza started before the Baleno's platform was even ready. One look at the kerb weight and you'd know it. While the Baleno is lightweight, for a sub-4 meter Maruti, the Vitara Brezza is on the heavier side. At 1,170 kg (1,195 for the top variant), it's just 10 kg lighter than the S-Cross DDiS 200. The Dzire, with a similar footprint weighs 1,050 kg, while the Baleno diesel tips the scales at just 960 kg. The SUV's structure uses high-tensile steel. Maruti says this is the first car to be certified for the Indian offset & side impact crash tests that are coming in 2017. The Vitara Brezza has been designed and engineered entirely by the Maruti Suzuki development team in India, led by Chief Engineer Mr. CV Raman. Development began in 2012 and it took around 3.5 years to become the final product that debuted at the 2016 Delhi Auto Expo. The company has invested Rs. 860 crore into this project and 98% of the Vitara Brezza's components have been locally sourced. It could have easily been 100%, but the 2% is perhaps to appease Suzuki Japan. At 3,995 mm, the Vitara Brezza is 4 mm shorter than the EcoSport. However, not only is the 1,790 mm width greater than the EcoSport's (1,765 mm), it also makes the Vitara Brezza 15 mm wider than the SUV it's based on i.e. the full-sized Suzuki Vitara! But the 1,640 mm height makes it shorter than the EcoSport (1,708 mm) and considerably shorter than the TUV300 (1,839 mm). The 2,500 mm wheelbase is shared with the full-sized Vitara and is 20 mm short of the EcoSport (and incidentally, the Baleno hatchback as well!). The XA Alpha concept was supposed to be a preview for Maruti's new compact SUV, but this mini-Vitara evidently takes its styling cues from the iV-4 concept that was presented at the 2013 Frankfurt motor show. The Vitara Brezza's exterior somehow defines the car as a package - nothing to really complain about, nothing to really exclaim about. BHPian thatsdileep unveiled the Vitara Brezza to the world before its Auto Expo debut. Maruti played it safe with a clean & conservative design that will please all & offend none. The large front bumper has aggressive contours around the indicator and foglamp clusters, while the chrome grille + dull silver faux skid plate combo works well to add a premium yet utilitarian touch. The pilot lamps (that can be used like DRLs) add some character, but they aren't as bright as the ones in the S-Cross or Baleno. During the day, you'll easily miss them. The side profile is where Maruti's designers have pulled off a masterstroke. As a term, ""compact SUV"" lands up being synonymous with ""glorified hatchback"", but that just isn't the case here and the Vitara Brezza looks like a cohesively styled S-U-V. It doesn't have the imposing presence of the TUV300 though. The black cladding along the lower half, blackened pillars, sporty roofline and healthy 198 mm of ground clearance add some appeal to the car. Looking at the rear, the design looks very familiar, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it at first. Yes, it does look a lot like the S-Cross, but it also is a bit reminiscent of the old Baleno Altura station wagon, mainly because of the tail light design. The black cladding continues to cut the bulk at the rear and another faux skid plate reminds you of this car's positioning as an SUV. Maruti wouldn't do it because the Japanese are fanatical about weight, but a tail-mounted spare wheel would greatly add to the Vitara Brezza's SUV credentials. The ""Bull-Horn"" L-shaped LEDs in the tail light cluster bring some novelty and the only thing that's a little off-putting is the plus-sized chrome appliqué above the number plate with 'Vitara Brezza' engraved on it. Like other Marutis, the paint quality is smooth and consistent with a nice sheen under daylight. The Vitara Brezza's styling isn't the most daring, yet in the dual-tone colour options, it is more snazzy and embodies the look many will associate with Minis. The dual-tone option was a smart way of dressing up an otherwise conservative design. The more subtle, but better selling colours (grey, white and silver) are available across the range, while the dual-tone shades (blue/white, yellow/white and red/black) are offered only on the range topping ZDi+. You also get the Vitara Brezza in single tone red (LDi to ZDi), blue (VDi to ZDi) and yellow (ZDi only). Fit and finish quality is good too, with no glaring panel gaps that will grab the attention of the layman. Build is typical Maruti stuff. The metal feels light at places and doesn't give you that solid feel of a Euro car. The doors aren't as feather-light as the Baleno's, but they're not like an EcoSport's either. Somewhere in between. Shut the Ford's doors after the Maruti's and you know why the American weighs more. The Vitara Brezza's build is acceptable, but nothing else. Must add, the bonnet & boot feel heavy & substantial though. All variants of the Vitara Brezza get a driver airbag as standard, and Maruti also offers the option of a passenger airbag, ABS with EBD and pre-tensioner + force limiter seatbelts at the front via the LDi (O) and VDi (O) variants. We strongly recommend this safety package. Overall, this SUV shares the same ethos as the Hyundai Creta i.e. it is an all-rounder in its segment, doing most things well, albeit without excelling in any single area. What's important to the market - as the Creta has shown - is there's no deal breaker. However, there are a few elephants in the room that have to be addressed: Why isn't Maruti offering a petrol? It's evidently a big goof up to not offer a petrol at a time when the market is swaying toward petrols! Maruti says SUVs are primarily diesel-powered in our country, but that's only for the heavy body-on-frame UVs. Among lighter compact SUVs, petrols have b-i-g potential. This must have been done to avoid any further delay in the Vitara Brezza's launch. Maruti doesn't have any petrol engine that would work with the car. We saw this on the S-Cross too. The 1.2L K-series petrol would be too puny for this SUV's kerb weight. On the other hand, the lackluster 1.4L from the Ciaz & Ertiga could have offered enough grunt, but would put it beyond the small car excise benefit cap. The higher excise slab would place a Vitara Brezza 1.4's pricing in the ballpark of the 1.3L diesel! What Maruti will do is offer the 1.0L Boosterjet turbo-petrol later this year. You will remember that Team-BHP fan Naren Konamme broke the scoop on the turbo-petrol at this link. The 998cc, 3-cylinder, 12-valve turbo-charged and intercooled petrol engine makes 110 BHP @ 5,500 rpm and 170 Nm of torque @ 2,000 - 3,500 rpm. Too bad it wasn't ready in time for the Vitara Brezza's launch. Why was the SHVS system skipped? Simple economics. The excise duty on hybrids is 12.5%. The Vitara Brezza is already in the 12% bracket (sub-4 meter and <1.5L diesel). In the 2016 Budget, the government implemented an 'infrastructure cess'. Citing pollution & traffic concerns, the government has imposed an infrastructure cess of 1% on sub-4 meter petrol, LPG & CNG cars with an engine <1.2 liters, 2.5% on sub-4 meter diesel cars with an engine <1.5 liters and 4% on all other cars (i.e. bigger cars & SUVs). The Ciaz & Ertiga are over 4 meters in length. Hence, they are eligible for a higher excise slab as well as the 4% infrastructure cess. SHVS brings their excise duty down to 12.50% and also exempts them from this 4% infrastructure cess. An SHVS for the Vitara Brezza would bring lesser $$$ benefits than the cost of the mild hybrid system! This is why you don't see SHVS in any other compact Marutis. Makes economic sense in bigger cars, but not the sub-4 meter ones. Why isn't the Vitara Brezza sold through NEXA? Because the NEXA strategy is confused to begin with. The Baleno is hardly premium, yet sells out of the supposedly premium NEXA channel. Then, Maruti's regular dealerships sell more expensive cars too (Ciaz, and now the Vitara Brezza). The real reason that the Vitara Brezza is sold through the regular channel (apart from NEXA's limited reach) is that Maruti dealers were livid after they not only missed out on the success of the Baleno, but also lost many would-be Swift buyers because of the Baleno. What about AWD? As is typical of this breed of compact urban SUVs, the Vitara Brezza is available with FWD only. AWD isn't even on the anvil. Remember, this is the same platform as the international Vitara and can run an AWD system, but in the segment, that's hardly a priority. The engineers haven't bothered as the AWD would form 1% of orders at best. The Vitara Brezza's face is the most eye-catching part of the car! Similarities with the S-Cross are apparent at the rear. A tail-mounted spare (à la EcoSport) would've greatly enhanced its SUV credentials: A very proportionate sub-4 meter SUV. In plain colours like silver or grey, the safe design is really please all and offend none - it's neutral. Unfortunately, the Vitara Brezza looks even more ordinary in the lower variants. Definitely not funky or futuristic like the EcoSport was when it was launched, and not butch or imposing like the TUV300 or Terrano either. That said, in the dual-tone exterior shades, the car looks snazzy and brings an Evoque or Mini-like vibe to a much more affordable segment. Our choice is the red + black dual-tone combo: Despite the small footprint, it pulls off the SUV look convincingly when viewed from the front. Doesn't look like a bloated hatchback: The generous ground clearance & butch cladding give it the right aesthetics, but make no mistake - this is an 'on-road' SUV: Pilot lamps (NOT DRLs) or 'bull-horn' LED light guides as Maruti calls them. They're not as bright as the S-Cross's and are difficult to spot during the day: Sweet-looking projector headlamps are offered with the ZDi and ZDi+ grades: Halogen projector for the low beam & a regular reflector for the high beam. Xenon headlamps aren't offered here, even though the cheaper Baleno gets them (image link)! Go figure: Prominent chrome grille. Toothy top looks somewhat similar to the pattern we saw on the Mahindra Imperio: Large honeycomb mesh air-dam is split by a black plastic strip that houses the number plate: The mesh grille is blocked off at certain spots: Vertically mounted intercooler on the right: Faux skid plate is finished in matt silver in the ZDi and ZDi+. Other grades get it in black. Application is only on the front side (unlike the Duster whose skid plate extends below). Aesthetic value only, no purpose: Front tow hooks (on both sides) are nicely integrated: Partial protective cladding underneath (doesn't even cover the oil sump). Still, 198 mm of ground clearance means we aren't that worried. Took it off the road a couple of times and she breezed through without any complaint: Indicator is housed independently in the bumper - looks neat. Very old-school layout. Round foglamps below are recessed and get a black surround: No aggressive contours or lines on the bonnet. Rather clean, just like the overall design: Headlamp is nicely tucked into the body line: Egad! Through the bonnet panel gap, you can see the parts inside. Incredibly u-g-l-y: Windshield washers are placed out of sight (under the bonnet). Tri-nozzle spray action per washer gives them a wide spread: DDiS badging on both front fenders. It'll be a while before you see booster-jet badges here: Blackened A-pillar like the Swift. This is a sticker (not paint). Also, lower variants don't get it (body-coloured A-pillar in their case): Light sensor for the automatic headlamps and rain sensor for the automatic wipers: Ugly radio antenna is far too outdated. It's inexplicable why Maruti would choose such an old design. The Swift's antenna (image link) is far more contemporary: Wing mirrors get integrated blinkers: Yes, they're India friendly. No concerns if a biker side-swipes them: Both front doors get request buttons for the passive keyless entry system. Driver's handle gets a keyhole too (for use when the smartkey's battery dies out): Squarish wheel arches for that tough SUV look. Fat tyres greatly enhance the stance. The ZDi / ZDi+ ride on 215/60 rubber (wider than even the S-Cross!), while the lower variants are shod with 205/60 section tyres. 16"" rims add to her personality. These rims, like the body styling, are clean & conservative. Nothing too funky: Front wheel wells don't get full cladding inside: Mudguards blend into the body-cladding: Black cladding across the entire car to bump up the butch SUV appeal. Plastic quality isn't flimsy here: Roof rails sit flush. ZDi / ZDi+ get them in 'gun metal grey', while the VDi / VDi (O) get them in black: Yes, the roof rails have functional mounts: Shiny black plastic panel at the base of the pillar for that floating roof effect (seen on the VDi and above): Tail light bulges out a fair bit outside the bodyline: Sub-4 meter packaging means a namesake bumper. Negligible gap between the bumper and tail gate. Possibility of body damage is high in a rear-ender: Drum brakes at the rear. The Vitara Brezza weighs almost the same as the S-Cross 1.3L and has the same power, yet only the S-Cross gets four discs: Rear wheel-well gets better cladding than that at the front: Two-part tail lamps. Check out the 'Bull Horn' LED light guides: Variant badging on the tail: Rear washer is integrated into the HMSL console. The HMSL lens is white (mostly red in other cars): Well-sized rear wiper does a good job of clearing the windshield: Vitara Brezza branding across the fat chrome appliqué. Bit flashy, but forgivable for what is otherwise a dignified design. Notice how the font size of the new brand Brezza is triple that of the existing brand Vitara: 4 rear parking sensors. Rear bumper has a faux skid plate as well. No rear foglamps, just reflectors: Exhaust end-can looks hideous. It's easily visible when you're standing behind the car. Should have been properly concealed: 198 mm of ground clearance will inspire confidence on tricky roads. We're getting back on the road here and, as you can tell, it's quite an elevation. She didn't scrape at all: Witness how the dual-tone paint shade transforms its personality. Will attract a lot of eyeballs: A look at the Vitara Brezza in white - another colour that will be a popular seller: The EcoSport was launched back in 2013. Even though it sits next to a brand new car here, the Ford doesn't look older: The EcoSport does however have more of a hatchback vibe than the Vitara Brezza: A tail-mounted spare wheel like the EcoSport (or TUV300) would add to the SUV appeal: The custom dual-tone paint jobs are available on the ZDi+. For Rs. 14,000 more, you can have a contrast coloured roof & wing mirrors. Here's a personal favourite - the Blazing Red with Midnight Black combination: The Cerulean Blue with Pearl Arctic White combination looks very Mini like (image): Not a big fan of the Fiery Yellow with Pearl Arctic White combo, but have seen a lot of dealers using this shade for their demo cars: ", 10th April 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Mumbai,"1,152","8,572"
2, Tushar , 14:50 ,Senior - BHPian," Hit the soft request button on the door handle (with the smartkey in your pocket) to unlock the Vitara Brezza and enter the cabin. Ingress and egress are easy. Yes, the 198 mm of GC does raise the floor-line, but you don't have to climb into the car. The seats are at just the right height and even senior citizens can simply sit down and get going. Once at the wheel, the first thing you'll notice is the great driving position. Both front occupants can see the bonnet, including those of an average height. Many people will particularly love this aspect and we feel it was a deliberate effort by Maruti's engineers. Roll your eyes onto the dashboard and like the exterior, you're presented with an interior that has been designed to be safe & neutral in its appeal. This is a straightforward and functional cabin layout. It's not as funky as the EcoSport's and, I have to admit, I did like the cheaper Baleno's ambience more. Still, the interior is very user-friendly and all the controls are logically laid out - they're just where you'd expect them to be. We were at home in the car in less than 5 minutes of driving. Maruti has gone with a classy all black palette and it's cut with eloquent doses of chrome & silver that add a nice touch to the understated arrangement. The black dashboard is smartly styled. You get a nice texture on the plastic, piano black finish around the air-con vents + centre fascia and brushed silver accents to boot. Very tasteful and neutral. However, it doesnt take more than a few seconds to pick out parts from Maruti's common components bin. For instance, the power window console is now long in the tooth (first seen in the Swift ages back) and the steering is all too familiar. Makes you wonder how many more models we will see these parts on, before Maruti decides to try something new. Fit & finish are acceptable, but nothing more. Plastic quality is what you'd expect of a Maruti. The quality is better than a Swift, but don't expect Hyundai-level finesse in here. Far from it! Even the EcoSport's interior quality feels superior. While you certainly won't praise the quality, neither will you complain about it. Again, the key term here is 'acceptable'. All parts are properly fitted and we didn't spot one misaligned piece or panel gap. You get well fitted, albeit hard and scratchy plastics. The silver touches on the dashboard & doors not only add to the interior aesthetics, they also feel premium, especially when compared with the rest of the cabin plastics. Overall, the quality doesn't feel upmarket, yet you'd be hard pressed to find any serious flaws. Despite the black interiors, the Vitara Brezza's cabin doesn't feel claustrophobic. Apart from the contrasting chrome and silver bits, the roof-line is finished in grey to brighten things up. The glass area is generous as well and gives you a good view of the world outside. Space on the inside is impressive for a sub-4 meter car. There's a healthy amount of legroom on offer even for taller drivers and the footwells are wide. The dead pedal is well-sized, well-angled and usable even for people with big feet (speaking as someone with size 15 shoes). The Vitara Brezza is 15 mm wider than the full-sized Vitara and shoulder room is healthy too. Additionally, the centre fascia wont interfere with your knee when you're operating the clutch (Swift / Dzire owners will know what I'm talking about). Headroom is great even for someone who's 6.5 ft tall. As CV Raman mentioned, the roof-line has been designed to be comfortable for a tall Sikh with his turban, among 18 types of Indian headgear. Fabric seats come as standard across the range; sadly, unlike the EcoSport, leather seats aren't offered on the top variant. The fabric quality is nice, but the EcoSport's seat support is superior. The seat cushioning is just right - not too soft nor too firm. One annoying trait was how front occupants can easily feel the knees of rear passengers in their back, if the rear occupants push their knees just a little into the seat. Under-thigh support is average for tall occupants. Both the seat base and backrest have bolstered edges and offer satisfactory lateral support. On the flip side, larger drivers will find the seats to be too snug. If you are a healthy adult, be sure to thoroughly test the front chair & ascertain whether it's comfortable for you. The driver's seat has a healthy range of height adjustment. Short driver? No problem. The adjustment levers for the backrest and seat height though, don't feel great to use and their action is ratchety. The center armrest is wide enough for both front occupants and it offers fore & aft adjustment too. Right below is space for storing a few items. The padding on the armrest could have been a little thicker, as you can feel the hard plastic underneath at times. The door armrests are nice to use even for those of us with long arms. As we've seen in new age Marutis, the ergonomics are perfect. 2 minutes in the driver's seat and you know where everything is. The stalks, gear lever and buttons all fall to hand easily. Evidently a solid reason why Maruti has employed an ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it"" approach to the cabin layout. In the ZDi+ with the Smartplay infotainment system, the centre fascia is uncluttered. If you are a fan of simplicity, you'll love it. You just have the infotainment screen and climate control at the bottom - no excessive buttons or knobs. One thing that is a letdown is the steering. The dashboard is uncluttered, but the steering isn't. With the controls for telephony, voice commands, cruise control and the audio system, you have 13 buttons in all. Additionally, at least on the million-rupee ZDi+ variant, I would have expected some premium leather wrap. A 10 lakh rupee car without a leather wrapped steering wheel!! The rim also feels a size too thin and there aren't any thumb contours on it. Using the same, slim and old steering from the Swift is just not done. Another sore point is that the steering only offers tilt adjustment. This is particularly shocking as the cheaper Baleno's steering has telescopic adjustment. The instrument cluster has a simple layout and is easy to navigate through. We did find the meters to be a size smaller than they should have been though. You get analogue dials for the tachometer & speedometer, outlined with mood lights - there are 5 colours to choose from (yellow, orange, red, white & blue). In the middle sits a well-sized MID that displays data including bars for the fuel-level and engine temperature, with digital readouts for the odometer, time, outside temperature, two trip meters, average + instant fuel economy and range / DTE counter. Then, you get a gear indicator with arrows to prompt upshifts or downshifts. Sweet touch - it shows you a dot when you are in the right gear. Frontal visibility is good and the A-pillars don't hinder visibility; much easier than the EcoSport whose tree-trunk A-pillars create massive blind spots. The power foldable / adjustable wing mirrors are big enough, although we found the IRVM to be small. It isn't auto-dimming either. Rearward visibility is hampered by the thick C-pillars and large rear headrests (when pulled up). Thankfully, parking sensors are offered with the VDi and above, while the ZDi+ tops that up with a reversing camera. The lack of a tail-mounted spare wheel does make it a bit easier to park. As expected, the Vitara Brezza isn't starved for niceties and you get the Smartplay infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and MirrorLink on the range-topping ZDi+. Good move in giving the Vitara Brezza the touchscreen ICE which started off in the more expensive Marutis. The system is no longer buggy & laggy as it was in the initial Ciaz batches. 4 speakers come as standard, while the ZDi+ gets an additional two tweeters on the front doors. The system offers USB, AUX and Bluetooth connectivity, plus navigation and voice commands. iPhone owners will be pleased with the CarPlay support & Android Auto is said to be in the works. Navigation is via pre-loaded maps from an SD card by Nokia HERE. Sound quality through the system is competent by OEM standards and most won't find the need for an upgrade, but it's nothing to write home about for sure (we found the EcoSport's sound quality to be superior). The screen is easy to use with good sensitivity, though like most touch-sensitive systems, it can be tricky to use on the move. Chauffeur driven owners can use the Suzuki remote control app (available on Android & iOS) to use the entertainment system. Mahindra's Blue Sense App lets you adjust the climate control system too, but that's not offered here. The climate control's buttons are logically laid out and feel pleasant to use. The air-conditioner is very powerful! Temperatures soared to nearly 40 degrees Celsius outside, yet we were cool as a cucumber inside. On the flip side, none of the vents get air volume control and Maruti has skimped on rear A/C vents as well. While the air-con is very effective, there's no doubting the value of rear vents which help to equalize temperate across the cabin. Practicality is not an oversight in the cabin and there's a fair number of storage spots. All 4 doors can hold 1L bottles, with some space to spare for the knick-knacks. The central armrest can be opened up to access a deep storage area underneath. On the passenger's side, you get a cooled upper glovebox that can hold a few small cans, in addition to the regular, medium-sized glovebox below. There's a storage tray under the front passenger's seat where valuable items can be kept away from view. In the dash center, there's space to place your cellphone below the USB/AUX ports. Next to the handbrake, you'll find two cup-holders. Lastly, near the driver's right knee is a cubby hole with a sloping bottom (so that things don't slide out). User-friendly cabin layout. No 'wow' factor, yet everything is logically placed. Quality is acceptable, but that's it - nothing more. Black interiors will be liked by a lot of folk; however, there's no denying they take away that 'extra' feeling of roominess. Some people will miss their beige. Ingress & egress are easy: Commanding view of the road ahead. Bonnet is easily visible and gives you the feel of a proper SUV. This will win over a lot of people in the showroom itself: Steering wheel from Maruti's Déjà vu collection. One too many models from the Maruti stable have the same steering wheel (including the Swift). At the least, it should have been thicker and come with thumb contours. No leather wrap in a 10 lakh car!! 13 integrated buttons in all make for a busy layout. Subtle chrome accents improve the look: Same functions as the S-Cross' steering, including cruise control. Buttons are well-sized. You can press and hold the arrow keys to fast forward & rewind tracks. Mute button is very practical (it pauses the track): Pull-type telephony controls are located behind the steering wheel. Some will like this arrangement, others won't: Steering is only height-adjustable! Strange as the cheaper Baleno's steering offers reach adjustment. This feature is important as it adds to that 'perfect driving position': Instrument cluster is easy to understand. However, we found the dials to be a size smaller than what they should've been. Love having the revv counter on the left and the speedometer on the right: The 5 different mood light options - take your pick from white, orange, yellow, blue and red: Twist the RHS instrument cluster stalk (to the left or right) and it will show this mood lighting menu on the MID. Push the stalk in to shuffle between the 5 colour options available. If you have the headlamps on, the illumination control display will also be shown on the MID and you can adjust it by twisting the stalk (left to reduce brightness, right to increase). The 7-step illumination control manages the brightness of the instrument cluster, MID, ICE, backlighting of the climate control console + steering mounted controls + buttons near your right knee (parktronic, headlamp leveller, push button start etc): MID isn't as sweet as the Baleno's (link to image). Provides adequate information, including bars for the fuel and engine temperature gauges, with digital read-outs for the odometer, time, outside temperature, two trip meters, average + instant fuel economy and a range / DTE counter: Ugly Honda City-like stalks sticking out of both sides of the cluster. Push the left one to shuffle between trip A and trip B. Very silly: such a prominent stalk and only one basic function: Push the right stalk in to shuffle between the displays of the average fuel economy, instant fuel economy and range/DTE counter, apart from the mood light + illumination control functions mentioned before: Rain sensing wipers and auto-headlamps are offered on the ZDi+. Sadly, rear wipers + washer + demister only on the ZDi & ZDi+: Push button starter gets a nice chrome outline. You need to press the clutch pedal & this button to fire up our national diesel engine: The 'disable parking sensor' button, ORVM controls and headlight leveller. Would prefer the conventional placement of the ORVM controls on the driver armrest instead. You have to stretch to access them in the Vitara Brezza. Incidentally, the ORVM controls look very similar to the old Baleno's (link to image), with the only exception being the ORVM-folding switch: Cubby hole right below. It is angled, so whatever you place in here won't fall out: All-black doorpad gets a premium silver accent and chrome door handle. All 4 doors can hold a 1L bottle, with space left over for the knick knacks: Zooming in on the texture of the plastics: Maruti Swift power window controls are an eyesore - we've been seeing them since ages. Can Maruti please change this console! Only the driver's button gets one touch up / down, illumination and anti-pinch functionality. Door also has fabric padding on the side where you'd rest your arm. The armrest is accommodating: Storage space for a 1L bottle + a few knick-knacks: 4 speakers come as standard. ZDi+ gets additional tweeters on the front doors: Fabric upholstered seats are comfortable. Larger frames will find them to be narrow though. Leather seats aren't offered on any variant, unlike the EcoSport: Headrest cushioning is on the firmer side. On our test car, the slim headrests weren't perfectly mounted - they moved around a bit: Classy seat fabric design: ZDi and ZDi+ get a height-adjustable driver's seat. These adjustment levers don't feel nice to use and their action is ratchety: Height-adjustment range is healthy. Shorter drivers will face no problem: Headroom is fantastic! The cabin has been designed to accommodate the frame of a 6 ft tall Sikh wearing his turban: OBD port just above the pull-type bonnet release lever: Padded dead pedal, well-spaced A-B-C pedals and a wide footwell mean your feet will be happy. Both footwells are illuminated: Fuel lid release isn't tucked into the floor mat like in the Baleno (reference image): Chrome tipped vent adjusters add a subtle premium touch. No air volume controller for any of the vents. You can also see the piano-black surround here: ORVMs offer a sufficient field of view: IRVM isn't auto-dimming - you have to do it manually. Unnecessary cost cutting really. We also found the IRVM to be a size too small: Thick C-pillars and large headrests eat into the rear view. Upper variants get reverse parking sensors + camera: Piano black surround for the centre fascia looks neat. Touchscreen ICE leads to a cleaner centre fascia. Takes away a lot of the buttons you'd normally see here: Hazard light button is chunky. Below is the light that flashes when the security system is armed: Climate control buttons are logically placed and well-sized. AUTO button is sensibly the largest. After all, it's the one you'll be most frequently using. Display is crystal clear to read: Deep storage space for your smartphone below the USB/AUX ports & 12V power socket. Should've ideally had some rubber padding to prevent scratches to your device & hold it in place: Two cup-holders sit between the front occupants. Notice how the handbrake is placed closer to the passenger like in a left-hand-drive car: Center armrest is adjustable and has a healthy travel range. It gets leather cladding (unlike the steering)! Comfy to use: Armrest has a deep storage bucket underneath: Brushed silver panel looks & feels premium. Very tasteful: Upper glovebox is cooled and offers decent storage. The lid has a partially damped effect, but it's poorly executed. When you open it, it won't go up all the way by itself. Same goes for when you close it: Illuminated primary glovebox is standard issue and offers adequate space for the vehicle papers, chargers, cables etc. Note the card holder to the right: TUV300 gets it under the driver's seat (link to image), while the Vitara Brezza gets a storage tray under the front passenger's seat (like the EcoSport). Load bearing capacity = 1 kg. Preferred place to carry cash or valuables - out of sight for any thief. In case you were wondering, 1 kg means ~8 lakh rupees in 1,000 rupee notes: Front cabin lamps can be operated individually by pushing them in: Sunglass holder is the same unit you get in the S-Cross: Only the front passenger gets a vanity mirror & lamp on the sunvisor. However, the lamp doesnt automatically switch on when you open the vanity mirror flap like in the Quanto or S-Cross. You have to manually switch it on by pushing the right side of the lamp in. Driver merely gets a flap to hold tickets: Only the ZDi+ variant gets height-adjustable seatbelts: A driver airbag comes as standard across the range. A passenger airbag, ABS with EBD and pretensioner + force limiter seatbelts can be added to the LDi and VDi via the option kit. Added safety kit costs around Rs. 13k - it's a no brainer.

3, Tushar , 14:50 ,Senior - BHPian,"The Smartplay Infotainment System Good to see Maruti's Smartplay head-unit here; it initially started off with the expensive Marutis. Familiar interface is simple to navigate through and lag free. No longer buggy as we'd seen in the early Ciaz examples: Proper font size makes the screen easy to read on the move: Wide range of media sources to choose from (including SD card): Pairing your smartphone is a breeze: Sound quality is decent by OEM standards, but nothing to write home about. If you want purer SQ, refer to points 2 - 5 in this post: Dial a number from your recent calls, contact list or use the dial pad. Interface is consistently sweet, no matter what the screen: Wide range of navigation entry options, including a search for Maruti outlets close by: SD card-based navigation interface is standard-fare.

Note that the VDi & ZDi get a physical remote control for their non-touchscreen conventional head-unit: ", 10th April 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Mumbai,"1,152","8,572"
4, Tushar , 14:50 ,Senior - BHPian,"Access to the rear is also a convenient affair. Apart from the raised seat height, CV Raman highlighted the fact that the B-pillar has been pushed ahead to give 2nd row passengers more space for ingress/egress. Moving the B-pillar opened up more of a gap between itself & the seat. The backrest angle at the rear isn't relaxed. While we didn't have a problem with that, there are some who'll find it a little too upright. Nope, the recline angle isn't adjustable like the EcoSport. This car is brilliantly packaged and the legroom is very good for a sub-4 meter car. At 5'10'', GTO could easily sit behind a driver of his height, with space to spare! Rear legroom & width are superior to the EcoSport. Fitting 3 here is a much more realistic proposition than in its American competitor, although the middle passenger won't have it easy due to the unlevelled backrest (area of the center armrest) and prominent floor hump. The TUV300's seat is wider and it is still the best ""people carrier"" in the segment, if that's what you are looking for. There is space to tuck your feet in under the Vitara Brezza's front seats, but the floor isn't level. Push your feet in and the front half of your foot will be up in the air! This is the first car that we've experienced such an uneven floor in. Like the front seat, the seat padding is not too soft nor too firm, and the compound should be comfortable on those weekend highway trips. On the downside, the seat is on the flatter side and doesn't have any contours to speak of. GTO found the under-thigh support to be lacking; tall occupants will want for more. The EcoSport's rear seat is noticeably more supportive for sure. Passengers on either side get large, adjustable headrests, but they suffer from the same problem as the S-Cross - many occupants will find them to be poking into their neck. You'll either have to adjust the neck restraint, your seating position (a bit) or both. The rear window isn't too tall, yet runs acceptably long. It's medium sized, but due to the rear quarter glass, there's a fair amount of light coming in. Black interiors don't give you the airy feel of beige; here, thanks to the generous headroom and grey roof fabric, you won't feel claustrophobic. The rear armrest is well-sized and gets integrated cup-holders. It's a comfortable spot for you to rest your arm. For storage, apart from the two very useful seatback pockets, you get a nifty bag hook behind the driver's seat that can take loads of up to 3 kg. Perfect place to hang the grocery / food bag. Like the front doors, there's space for a 1L bottle & knick knacks on the doorpad. Look up and you'll see coat hooks on both grab handles. We'll mention again that rear air-con vents are missing. Not only do they help to equalize the temperature across the cabin, they also cool the rear half quicker if the car has been parked under the sun. There isn't a charging socket for your smartphone either (yes, you can use the one in the boot, though it's hardly convenient to access from the second row). If you want to open only the boot, there's a request button above the number plate that will unlock the 5th door (only). Unlike the EcoSport, the tail-gate opens up vertically like a regular hatchback. The boot's on-paper '328 liter' spec will disappoint you, but there is no denying that Maruti has given it a very practical layout. Useable space is definitely more than its on-paper spec would have you believe. There aren't large wheel arch bulges eating into the boot like in the EcoSport. It's accommodating enough for the weekend luggage though, of course, you can't compare it to SUVs like the Duster. The loading lip is set at a good height and it isn't much higher than the boot floor. Further, the boot's mouth is wide to aid easy loading. There are two deep storage bins on either side of the boot floor with removable flaps. Apart from a light to illuminate the boot, you get a 12V charging socket (useful for refrigerators, portable vacuum cleaners, air-pumps etc.). The top-end variants (ZDi, ZDi+) are equipped with versatile 60:40 splitting seats, while the rear seat flip & fold feature is standard across the range. Doors open wide enough. Taller stance will get a thumbs up from senior citizens. B-pillar was pushed a bit ahead on this platform for the Vitara Brezza: All-black doorpad with a classy silver insert. Door armrest is long & usable. Doorpad is sculpted in where the armrest is mounted, so that it doesn't reduce cabin width: No back-lighting for the power window controls! Black fabric padding on the side: 1L bottle holders on the rear doors as well. Separately partitioned space for the odd items: Rear bench is flat! No contours to speak of - EcoSport's rear seat is much more supportive. Vitara Brezza's rear seat could definitely have been more richly padded: 5'10'' tall Aditya is sitting behind his own driving position. Legroom is good for a sub-4 meter car. Scooped-out seatbacks liberate knee room and there's adequate space below the front seat for your feet, even if you're wearing boots. Under-thigh support is poor for tall dudes though: Legroom is manageable even with the seat pushed all the way back: Two seatback pockets, unlike the Baleno which gets one. We're big fans of the utility offered by seatback pockets: Li'l baggage hook behind the driver's seat can be used for bags that weigh up to 3 kg. You can fold it in when not in use: Floor underneath the front seat isn't flat. Feels very awkward when the front half of your foot is in the air! This is a unique problem that we haven't experienced in any other car: Prominent floor hump; remember, the same platform runs an AWD on the bigger Vitara. 5th occupant will have to place his feet on either side of the hump: Rear armrest gets integrated cup-holders. It's well-sized and positioned at a comfortable height. Can accommodate 2 forearms: Headrest cushioning is on the firmer side. It suffers from the same design flaw as the S-Cross' rear headrest and pokes into your neck. Most people will have to adjust the headrest, their seating position or both. No neck restraint for the middle passenger: As you can see here, the lower edge juts into the nape of the passenger's neck. Even though the vehicle has a sloping roofline, headroom at the rear is adequate: Good to see a cabin light console in the center of the cabin (over & above the one at the front): Slot to park the seatbelt when it's not in use. Provided on both sides of the rear seat: Upper half of the cabin is finished in grey. Cuts the black monotony and provides a welcome contrast to the black interior. Roof liner feels durable. It isn't flat however (notice the hump on which the cabin lamp is fitted): Tail gate opens upward like a regular hatchback. EcoSport and TUV300 have tailgates that open sideways. One issue is that the boot needs to be slammed shut. It doesnt seem to lock in place very easily. Lost count of the number of times we had to stop the car during our test-drive because whoever shut the boot didn't do it with force: Full cladding on the inside: Small 328 liter on-paper spec, but it has a practical layout. Useable space is better than its specification would have you believe. Loading bay is low enough & wide: Backrest can be folded down by pulling this strap: You get a splitting rear bench: To fold it flat, you have to pull on this strap & flip the seat base forward: Carpeting hasn't been skipped underneath the seat base either : With the seat base flipped, you get a flat floor for hauling cargo: Boot has a 12V power socket and light: Baggage hook on the left: Storage trays on either side of the boot floor: Med kit parked in the right boot tray: Dual-side operable parcel tray can be flipped from the rear seat or tailgate side. Nifty if a passenger wants to fetch something from the boot: Spare wheel inside the vehicle, like a regular hatchback (not under the car or on the tail-gate). Definitely easier to mount & dismount than the other arrangements. It's a full-sized spare, but sadly... ...a regular steel wheel. No alloy wheel = cost cutting. Hard to believe this is the same company that once gave away alloy spare wheels to existing Swift ZXi owners related link. EcoSport also gives you a 5th alloy wheel: Tools are beautifully housed in a Styrofoam case: ", 10th April 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Mumbai,"1,152","8,572"
5, Tushar , 14:50 ,Senior - BHPian,"An engine we're well acquainted with by now, running the higher state of tune: Maruti is expected to go all-new with the 1.0L Boosterjet turbo-petrol later, but for now, we get the tried and tested, Fiat sourced, 1.3L, DOHC, 4-cylinder diesel with a variable geometry turbo (VGT) that we've seen in the S-Cross, Ertiga and Ciaz. The power and torque figures are familiar i.e. 89 BHP @ 4,000 rpm and 200 Nm of torque @ 1,750 rpm. Because of the Vitara Brezza's kerb weight, Maruti decided to give it the higher state of tune (not 74 BHP like the Swift & Baleno). Press the clutch, hit the engine start / stop button to fire her up and there's no getting away from the fact that she's an oil-burner. Vibrations at start-up are well managed, albeit you'll always know she's a diesel thanks to the familiar clatter. Revv it and the diesel gets audible inside the cabin. There's no comparing it to the refined Hyundai 1.4L CRDi (as an example). If you've driven an Ertiga, you've pretty much experienced the Vitara Brezza. Their behaviour has a lot in common and perhaps, that's a good thing for those upgrading from the Swift / Dzire as there's no learning curve. At low rpms and within the city, the 89 BHP diesel does have some amount of turbo-lag. It isn't excessive though, nor is the engine dead below 2,000 rpm like the Duster 110 FWD used to be. Things are acceptable in the 1,500 - 1,800 revv range and you can still push on in the same gear. It didn't bother us at all and we were happily driving the Vitara Brezza around in Pune traffic. However, when the revv needle drops too low or you need instant punch, you'll have to downshift. No two sides to that. Driveability isn't as good as the EcoSport 1.5L diesel which offers stronger low-end torque & linear power delivery. You'll also be downshifting more when climbing up mountain roads where the lag can catch you out, as we discovered on the beautiful Khambatki Ghat. Open-road acceleration is adequate, but not exciting. Once the turbo is spooling, there is a noticeable spike and you'll find the mid-range to be punchy. Highway performance is competent - overtaking is easy as long as the revv needle is hovering over 2,000 rpm (else you need to downshift). The high seating position helps too, giving the driver excellent visibility. This 1.3L diesel is free-revving in nature and willing to go beyond 5,000 rpm when you need to hold a gear. In terms of cruisability, 100 km/h in 5th gear sees the tacho kiss 2,400 rpm, while 120 km/h comes up at ~2,900 rpm. Not as relaxed as the EcoSport diesel which does the same speeds at 2,100 rpm & 2,500 rpm (respectively). Still, the engine is inaudible when cruising at 100 km/h and you won't even know it's a diesel under the hood. While the Vitara Brezza is no speeding rocket, it can be a decent inter-city traveller. Equally, we might add, the SUV is more suited to those with a calm driving style than enthusiasts. Let's see if the boosterjet turbo-petrol changes that. The 1.3L diesel is known for its efficiency and it's no different under the hood of the Vitara Brezza. The ARAI rating is 24.3 km/l. Its fuel-economy should keep owners happy. The NVH package is strictly average, and you aren't aloof from the world outside or even the engine. The diesel's clatter can be heard at idle and on the move too, even if the air-con and music system are running. Within the city at low rpms, things are alright. As the rpm needle climbs, it's far from being whisper quiet. There is a fair amount of wind & road noise that filters into the cabin. On the other hand, vibration and harshness levels are well under control. The 5-speed gearbox is the same as the Ciaz / Ertiga and behaves the same too. The gates are properly defined and the lever is sure slotting. It's a good gearbox to use, even if it's not the slickest of units around. The clutch is light enough. The pedal has just the right amount of weight and is never cumbersome to use (stating this after spending several hours in crawling Pune traffic). Ride quality is compliant at the front & rear and the SUV handles uneven roads well. On large potholes or sharp edges, you'll definitely feel the firmness of the suspension, although it's nowhere as stiff as the EcoSport. On bad roads, the Vitara Brezza is more comfortable than the Ford (neither is as absorbent as the Duster or Creta though). Ride comfort improves with speed and on the highway, you might not even slow down for moderately broken roads. Bumps at 100 km/h are absorbed well. That big tyre size is surely a contributor; its sidewall height is 129 mm (for reference, Ertiga = 120.25 mm). On undulating roads at speed however, the rear end isn't as planted as the EcoSport. There is some amount of bounciness at the back over wavy roads, although it's not as noticeable as in the Creta. The suspension is audible when doing its work, unlike the EcoSport whose hardware is silent. The Vitara Brezza is a clean & neutral handler with very predictable behaviour. Grip levels from those fat 215 Apollo Alnac tyres were confidence inspiring when we were pushing the SUV on the ghat section. At the limit, understeer starts to come in a gradual manner. Not scary at all. Body roll is also under control, though of course, it's more than in a regular hatchback or sedan. You'll feel the height, yet it's not unnerving in any way. This is a sorted machine and feels planted, even if the EcoSport is the sharper handler with decidedly richer dynamics. The Vitara Brezza is sufficiently stable at high speeds. There's no nervousness and it feels like it can cruise at 120 km/h all day long. Because the Vitara Brezza feels so much like a regular car, first time SUV drivers will find it to be an easy drive. Certainly not like early Duster 110 owners who complained about the steering's aggressive comeback action, heavy clutch, funny ergonomics and significant turbo-lag. The steering is standard Maruti fare. It's light enough at parking speeds, but not one-finger light. Within the city, the EPS is very convenient to use & fairly direct in its operation. As the speedometer climbs, the steering weighs up enough and there's no nervous feeling or twitchiness at all. Enthusiasts shouldn't expect much feedback from it though - got nothing to offer in that department. This is a typical Maruti mass-market steering. We mention again that the steering wheel should have been thicker, and the lack of leather-wrapping at this price is alarming! The ground clearance of 198 mm is more than enough to tackle potholes and the mini-trekking attractions that our municipality calls speed breakers! We took the Vitara Brezza off the highway to a photoshoot location and she cleared the rough terrain without breaking into a sweat. Just don't get carried away as this is a FWD SUV meant to stay on the road. The Vitara Brezza's brakes work as is expected of them & stopping ability is par for the course. Under hard braking too, the SUV doesn't lose its composure. On the silver test car that we drove from Pune to Wai, we found the brake pedal to be fine. However, in the white test car that we ran around Mumbai, the brake pedal needed more bite - we wish it was sharper. The Mumbai car's brake needed to be pushed a little more than expected. Also, on both cars, sponginess was evident on the pedal. Nose dive is noticeable at the front end, even under moderate braking.

6, Tushar , 14:50 ,Senior - BHPian,"Other Points: • We don't think the XA Alpha had anything to do with the Vitara Brezza. (related link ). It was merely a concept to send the message that Maruti's compact SUV is coming. • Turning radius is unimpressive at 5.2 meters i.e. identical to the bigger S-Cross. The Dzire with the same 3,995 mm length has a 4.8 meter rating. Expect that many more 3-point u-turns. EcoSport is even wider at 5.3m! • The Vitara Brezza is as much of a neutral all-rounder in its segment as the Creta is in the 15 lakh space. There are a lot of similarities in the way the two are positioned in their respective segments. Both do most things alright, without excelling in any single area....equally, neither of them have a serious deal breaker. The two are also backed by 'can't go wrong' brands. Clearly, a successful formula. • This compact SUV is being produced at Maruti's Gurgaon plant. • Horn has a nice ring to it. Very urban SUV-like tone. Suits its personality. • This is the second 'diesel only' Maruti after the S-Cross. Strange time to begin such a trend when the market is moving toward petrols! But then, Suzuki doesn't have a competent 1.3 - 1.5L petrol. No doubt, their turbo-petrol has overshot its deadline. • Know how some manufacturers skip the HVAC's dust & pollen filter for cutting costs - related thread? The Vitara Brezza doesn't. All variants get one. • Why do we say that the VDi is too basic? Here's a document listing some missing features - VDi Missing Features.docx! • Maruti's ever-growing dealership network is now up to 1,800 outlets! Will it touch 2,000 in another year or two? • All-black body colour missing!

Boot is linked to the central locking system. • 48 liter fuel tank capacity. • The Vitara Brezza was unveiled at the 2016 Auto Expo, launched within a couple of weeks, and the media drives happened soon after. Tata needs to learn. The Zica / Tiago media drives were in December 2015 and the launch has taken place in April 2016! Enough time for the car to exit public memory. We saw the Hexa at the Auto Expo - when is it coming?? • We were told at the media event that the Ignis will be a NEXA model (related thread). • As of now, Maruti has no plans to launch the full-sized Vitara & take on the Creta. • Service intervals = 1 month / 1,000 km (1st service), 6 months / 5,000 km (2nd service), 12 months / 10,000 km (3rd service and all those after that). • Maruti's dealerships aren't installing the side skid plate properly. Thanks to Leoshashi for the tip in this post ! • Standard warranty is for 2 years / 40,000 km. Extendable to the 4th year. An excel sheet with pricing is attached to this post.

Cost-cutting is very obvious  Mediocre rear seat legroom. More like C1 segment sedans than C2  Poor NVH insulation. Engine, road & wind noise are prominent inside the cabin  No 3rd row of seats. You can buy 7-seater SUVs at the same $$$  AMT unavailable with the AWD; Scorpio & XUV500 both offer 4x4 / AWD ATs  Renault's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss", 10th April 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Mumbai,"1,152","8,572"
9, GTO , 15:29 ,Team-BHP Support,"Thread moved from the Assembly Line to Official Reviews! Going by the buzz & the bookings, Maruti has obviously gotten the formula spot on! As you rightly said, the overall positioning is very similar to the Creta (even though their segments are different). Both are all-rounders doing most things well, in a neutral inoffensive manner. Equally, while the Vitara Brezza is a competent Maruti, my pick would be the EcoSport. The EcoSport has solid build quality, noticeably more so than the Brezza. In terms of equipment, I get 6 Airbags, telescopic steering adjustment, better sound quality from the ICE, more supportive leather seats...(these are important to me). The EcoSport's diesel offers superior driveability & refinement. Petrol or AT is a no-brainer as the Vitara Brezza doesn't have either. Period. The American also holds the handling advantage (although the Maruti is good and doesn't leave any room for complaints). The Vitara Brezza rides better, offers more room at the back & has the trustworthy Maruti support network. It's probably a better product for the mass market.

Though this review shed a lot of light into the roominess of the cabin, I am still not clear if the rear seat of the Brezza offers better headroom than the Ecosport.

Hey Amit, I believe you live in Shimla and must be often driving in the hills. If that is the case then the Vitara Brezza or any car for that matter having high turbo lag is not suitable for you. Cars with smaller engines and high peak power/torque ratings are stymied by huge turbo lag, the reason being they deploy larger turbos to get that higher peak power/torque output from smaller engines. These turbos start spooling beyond 1750 or 2000 rpm and only beyond that rpm the car feels lively/peppy. Such cars are a blast to drive on open roads/highways, but in stop-go traffic or in the hills/ghats these are quite cumbersome (as you have already experienced and seconded by windiesel). If you are looking only at SUV category then, I think a car like Ecosport (with higher cc engine and lower turbo lag) would be more suitable for you, or better still a car with rear wheel drive (since you often drive in the hills and RWD cars are suited when carrying additional loads).

After 400+ Km on the odo and two weeks of ownership i can tell you VITARA BREZZA is an able car and wants to to be in hills. I am driving in and around Shimla and have been climbing all the roads and could not find any difficulty in any winding uphill roads.I feel it is even more eager and comfortable to climb as compared to my RITZ Petrol. I have driven over 200K Km in Hills (petrol only) and had been a big critic of Diesel cars without any experience(just like many drivers in the hills). But now with very limited driving experience i can agree with all modesty, this diesel car is no lesser than a petrol.You just need to get adjusted and re-align to the driving dynamics. While driving, I am not getting over enthusiastic and keeping the car below 2K RPM till my first service but till now i have very positive experiences with the car. Please pardon me for the following lines but i could not stop myself...

But it felt real easy to drive with great visibility. Seating position is nice and high. Very same day made full payment and scheduled a delivery on 8th.

The punto already has lesser turbo lag since a large no. of puntos utilise the 75 bhp version of the national engine which uses a smaller turbo and therefore results in smaller turbo lag., 11th April 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,All,481,241

Saw this car in-person on Gudi Padwa and was mighty impressed, as mentioned in the review, the car is w-i-d-e, and that gives it a badi gaadi feel. The Eco-sport, Fiat Avventura and to some extent, Duster (85 PS) will have to be concerned. The door mounted extra wheel, apart from looking SUVish, is practical when you take the car on a full blown vacation and have a flat tyre. Removing luggage or rear passengers is a real pain when changing wheels and most of us don't care to check the air pressure of that extra wheel very often. Hope Maruti does that in later editons. I respectfully disagree to one point about Nexa outlets in the review though: The Nexa strategy is not confused if you start looking at the minor details of the review. The absence of Bi-xenon lamps, leather wrapped steering wheels, auto dimming IRVM or all four disc brakes or the mention of premium feel in Baleno compared to Vitara Brezza all point to one thing: Cars sold through Nexa outlets are a little premium compared to normal ones, Nexa outlets are for those discerning customers who want cars which have these small niceties that are otherwise not present in normal 'Maruti' cars.", 11th April 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Pune,"1,052","3,692"

The least mark obviously goes to the Baleno, which was once by dream car for replacing my Alto K10, but not anymore. What looked like a dream became a nightmare the moment I started driving it. The build quality was unbelievably tinny for such a huge looking car(huge in its segment). The Vitara Brezza on the other hand is definitely a very practical car. The Brezza offers the same excellent practicality of Ertiga in an SUV avatar and with more equipment. This one was born to be a hit. However, I only wish some basic necessities like a rear wiper were offered on all variants. The moment Maruti chose not to sell this in Nexa they went back to their old ways of not offering rear wiper, and even rear power windows on lower variants. For me, S-Cross is a clearly superior car among the three. It has a decidedly superior build that you can feel while driving.

72, GameOfCars , 16:41 ,BHPian,"Another absolutely wonderfully crafted review by the team and that too of one of the most awaited cars of the year. Giving a well deserved 5 star to the thread. I think its a wonderful product from the Maruti-Suzuki stable and it surely will be a huge success with the masses. I've seen quite a number of Suzuki Vitara here in London and going by the size, it itself seems like a rather compact SUV i.e. even smaller than the Creta and Duster. I'm really skeptical how the Brezza looks with its under 4 meter body hangings. But given the fact Maruti had to undercut that length, they have done a wonderful job with the overall design. Interiors are a huge let down for me specially that same old boring steering wheel which has been there for over a decade now. I remember how the flat bottom steering wheel introduced by VW in the Polo/Vento enhanced the looks of an already good looking dash by many folds. Wished Maruti could have paid more attention to the interiors department as well to make this car look a tad bit premium from its half priced siblings. I know the masses don't bother much about these fine details but someone who likes spending much of their leisure time in their machines behind the wheel, would certainly agree to have had something better to hold. And the same old previous gen Swift's power windows switches on the doors look so out of place in a 2016 car. Boot-space too seems a bit of a downer, but I guess Ecosport is no better there either. For that matter, I prefer to take our old Ford Fiesta Classic against the new Hyundai Creta for the airport runs(sometimes even Chandigarh to New Delhi airport and back) as it has a better usable boot space and no one in my family likes to travel light which I guess is the case with most of us Indians. There is no denying the fact that there is a huge craze to be driving around in a SUV/compact SUV these days, but if i were a buyer in this segment, I would chose a mid sized sedan over these cars anyday.

92, paragsachania , 08:22 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Wonderful review Tushar and GTO. I had to see this up on a day when I incidentally took a TD of the Brezza at one of the dealerships yesterday where I had been with a friend to get his car serviced and happened to see a Yellow and White Brezza asking to be cranked. My TD of this vehicle was purely to understand how the same Engine behaves on a different vehicle as I own an Ertiga and was curious about this. Here are my impressions:Overall, this one does look like a pseudo SUV and not really a raised hatch Those 215 Tires on 16"" RIM simply complement the characteristic of this vehicle. Does full justice this time Perhaps one of those Marutis in their latest offerings where a driver can notice the bonnet clearly The TD Vehicle has cladding all around that was an overkill. I would prefer no extra cladding apart from what you get here Build is again a typical Maruti. Ford wins hands down. Suspension felt firmer compared to Ertiga Engine & Performance: Here is exactly where I wanted to try it out. The first impression on starting was the insulation. I would call this definitely better than Ertiga in comparison. No second thoughts at all. The Engine noise levels in the Brezza are on the lower side compared to the Ertiga. If for once I think this is because my Ertiga has become noisy after clocking 87,000 kms then its a wrong thought as I drove a brand new SVHS Ertiga and found the noise levels same as my Ertiga. Well done on the insulation (In comparison to Ertiga) and this will certainly make me embark on a sound insulation project now like I did in my F10D WagonR soon upon driving the K10 and finding it more silent at higher revs Clutch felt smooth for a Diesel (typical Maruti here) and movement from Standstill without pressing the throttle gave the exactly the same impressions like the Ertiga While on the move, the only noticeable difference I could make out was the Turbo Kick. This was indeed more prominent in the Brezza than the Ertiga. Again, I found the Turbo kick in the SHVS Ertiga same as mine. I am wondering if this was due to weight of the vehicle but then we were 3 adults too Braking is typical Maruti again. Soft Pedals and adequate bite Gear-shift like Tushar already mentioned is same as Ertiga and nothing to complain about On Space, I am impressed at the leg space in the rear bench with a tall driver like me (6'3"") on the driver's seat. Definitely better than the Ecosport. But the seat is near flat that the underthigh support is what one would ask for on long trips The boot is nothing great to talk about and the capacity would only help with usual travel baggage but not generous loading Quote: Originally Posted by Tushar If you've driven an Ertiga, you've pretty much experienced the Vitara Brezza. Their behaviour has a lot in common Yes, almost there with negligible difference the way the Turbo kick is felt in the Brezza compare to Ertiga. Other characteristics remains same with both. Quote: At low rpms and within the city, the 89 BHP diesel does have some amount of turbo-lag. It isn't excessive though, nor is the engine dead below 2,000 rpm like the Duster 110 FWD used to be. Things are acceptable in the 1,500 - 1,800 revv range and you can still push on in the same gear. Tell me about it. Took a few drives till I got hold of the weak points and after that its business as usual. You as a driver will know what gear to be in at the right time so that you have got all the punch - be that city driving or Highway overtakes. Quote: Passengers on either side get large, adjustable headrests, but they suffer from the same problem as the S-Cross - many occupants will find them to be poking into their neck. You'll either have to adjust the neck restraint, your seating position (a bit) or both. Quote: Headrest cushioning is on the firmer side. It suffers from the same design flaw as the S-Cross' rear headrest and pokes into your neck. Most people will have to adjust the headrest, their seating position or both. No neck restraint for the middle passenger: Now this has been a problem in the Ertiga as well. The design is similar as you can see in the below picture. To overcome this, I have swapped the 3rd row head restraints onto the second one. They haven't really solved the problem completely but definitely made things better as the restraints on the 3rd row have a different angle and thickness that one can still sit straight and rest their head on it. Will this sell and why? They managed the looks right and there is a whole lot of crowd like others wanting to drive an SUV but affordability & then efficiency always mattered till we saw a lot such avatars thronging our market and people buying it to fulfill their desires! Its got passenger space that one wouldn't really complain about. Its prefect for the size and not claustrophobic from anywhere inside at all. Its got an efficient and a reliable engine that is a decade old but hey, its till no compromise at all if buyers look at the other positives The controls are smoother - Specially the clutch and one of those things you want when driving inside the city. Your leg would not complain after driving B2B for more than an hour. On top of it all, the Brezza sold through MSIL outlets will reach out to the masses.

I am very pleased to hear of this decision. But I would still ask you to consider the 1.6 Alpha - there is nothing that is quite as good as that when it comes to the S Cross.

148, poised2drive , 19:44 ,BHPian,"Great Review with exhaustive and intricate details ! Typical TBHP Review And I have to say the MSIL has done it again ! No nonsense design with trendy colour shades, India's National Engine, Maruti Badge coupled with a sensible pricing- You hit a jackpot in the Indian Market. Brezza might appear an upmarket product with its sleazy looks but Maruti played it well not placing it in the Shops of NEXA and it better suits the semi-urban areas with its higher GC and the impeccable reliability . This product seems to be specifically released by keeping in view of the tastes of the non-metro/cosmopolitan areas viz B-tier, C-tier cities and semi urban towns . This is a perfect upgrade for the owners of Alto/Wagon-R or even Swift given the Baleno's accessibility is confined to very few places, mostly urban centres. One of the oft-cited cons about the Brezza here is the lack of exciting interior features , but as I understand , the customers intended for this product are not very keen on such features and mostly go with the Flesh of the Car [ with the company tag] and a typical SUVish looks and to say the least, the Vitara Brezza looks beautifully proportionated and poses an impressive stance on the Road. Vitara Brezza looks balanced, clean and elegant unlike its other competitors which have a rather Bloated and disproportionate looks. Quote: Originally Posted by shankar.balan .

The waiting period is something that settles down after the initial lot is dispatched and the euphoria boils down. After all, most of these cars receive a pre-booking even before launch and that runs into 10s of thousands easily. Over a period of next 6 months of launch, a pattern gets created from sales perspective and accordingly units are manufactured and dispatched to dealerships. I have tried for getting early delivery of cars at dealership folks who that I have known very closely and failed.

I've seen M800s modified to have the spare wheel on tailgate! i am a new member of team-bhp, and i revere senior members like romeomidhun. but sir i want to say that the devil lies in the details. 1. The 1.5 ltr engine might seem inferior compared to the brezza on paper but the vitaras engine is meant for a speeding car and the TUVs meant for capable steady people moving in rough terrain. Barring the no of cylinders the 1.5 ltr mHawk has a greater displacement and much larger torque at very low almost 1100 rpm which is an absolute must in the rough terrains the TUV will ply on. The vitaras lack of low end grunt makes it difficult in these situations along with a lower 1.2 ltr displacement. On the other hand the vitarars superior 3 digit performance makes it an incredible speedy vehicle for the highways and emptyish city roads. Now what does one desire in an SUV viz a viz car is up to the readers judgement. 2. the 182mm IS less compared to 198 mm what with our govt roads with 20cm(3/4th foot ) pot holes But more significant is the suspension and the TUV is more pliant to glide over rough terrain while the brezza is Firm for good high speed handling and steady ride. The choice is the readers again. 3.The handling again on the construction and chassis, the real SUV ladder on frame chassis gives the TUV durability on impact and Extremely high load bearing capability(wont dream of a brezza collision). while the monococcque on the brezza gives never before experienced car like maneuvering NOT SUV carlike handling. 4. this i completely agree with you sir , Mahindra purposely held back features for the nuvosport.

What I was saying is, as I mentioned earlier, the terms ""SUV"" etc are relative to one's own purpose and thoughts.

197, thatsdileep , 13:59 ,BHPian,"Glad to hear all occupants were safe. Couldn't quite make out from the pics if the air bags deployed. I won't Think they would've as the impact seems to be on top of the bonnet and windshield. Correct me if I'm wrong. Anyway, finally had some spare time to drop into a MS showroom to check out the Brezza. Dealership - Khivraj, Mount Road, Chennai Dealership Experience- I called in the morning to find out if the TD vehicle was available and the answer was yes but can't be sent for a home visit. So I said I'll check into the showroom in next hour. I entered the showroom and was not really attended by anyone, although there were quite a few associates near the front desk. I started checking out the Brezza on display and 5 mins into it and someone came to ask if I was attended to which I replied no. Immediately they were apologetic and atleast 2 associates came rushing. From there on it was a good interaction. Vehicle (Vitara Brezza) Experience - Coming to the vehicle here are my 2 cents (I won't flood this post with too many pics as the official T-BHP review is already out and I'm sure I won't be able to match that level of detail with the minimum time I spent with the car): Interiors/Exteriors:The exterior looks very proportionate and the design looks very contemporary & simple (in a good way) The exterior panel gaps (as already pointed out in the official review) seem to be inconsistent. The paint quality is ordinary and some of the parts in engine bay seem to have very crude finish and even under the spare wheel area The seating for driver and front seat passenger is very comfortable and the driving position is excellent with great view ahead (larger front glass area) and bonnet edge is visible. The adjustable arm rest makes things even more comfortable. The rear seat comfort was a disappointment. Although there was good leg room available, meager under thigh support as well as the extremely uncomfortable headrests (poking into the neck) will probably never allow me to find a comfortable position. MS should have come up with a better headrest orientation/design. The body will be rested against the back rest at approx a 70 deg angle while the head rest is probably at around 80-85 deg angle which makes it very uncomfortable and is always pushing the head forward. There is no trunk release from inside the car and it is a press button open on the hatch. The display car had a dead battery and the trunk couldn't be opened. They had to replace the battery to open the trunk. Further, it seems to take some effort and atleast a couple of attempts to close the trunk and the same was noticed on both display and TD cars. However, the space is quite usable due too its wider mouth and low loading lip makes it a breeze to load the luggage. The interior plastic quality is just OK and felt hard and brittle. The top glove box locking mechanism was already broken on the display car (small piece of plastic broke near the lock) and it won't close. Most of the switch gear, steering wheel seems very old and dated. Drive Experience: Before I start talking about my drive experience I want to leave a disclaimer that my observations are based on a mere 2 km distance TD within full Chennai city traffic conditions. So no high speeds or off-road/bad patches. There is some vibration felt inside the cabin when the engine is cranked up but it will settle down after that. The NVH levels are acceptable when idling or low rpms, but the engine noise does creep in once the throttle is pressed harder. Don't expect a hyundai'esque refinement levels. But not really a deal breaker. The steering is quite easy to manoeuvre in city traffic, can't say at high speeds though. There is hardly any power at low rpms (below 1800-1900). Having said that one can easily amble around in city traffic at 15-30 km/h in 3rd gear as long as the throttle input is limited to a minimum. But if you need to move on. There is nothing available at those low rpms and the gears need to be worked. Once you get past 2000 rpm there is a decent surge of power which will push it with ease. The breaks have decent bite and have sufficient stopping power but there seems to be some front end nose dive. Seemed like a stable car at those low speeds (50 kph tops) I tested it, but I know the stability is more applicable for high speeds. All in all I was not overwhelmed nor underwhelmed with Brezza but my stance is just neutral. As already indicated in official review, Brezza does't really excel in any department but its a all round package which will tick most boxes and works just fine. With MS badging backing it, Brezza will certainly hit the top 5 on the sales charts. I sincerely wish MS comes up with a potent Petrol mill to complement Breeze's package and I'll be in for a buy.", 16th April 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Chennai,251,307

I believe the dealers (most of them) will be incompetent of giving a good paint finish on the roof top. We can pick out the specialised people for the custom paint job, which would run over 15-16 grand easily. My pick would be a wrap with different finish than a glossy one. Matt wouldn't go along the glossy red so probably a carbon fibre finished wrap. 3M one's for carbon finish one's cost around 400-500 Rs/sqft so they might end up north of 13K for brezza.

I am still to drive the car above 60 Kmph and would be cautious on highways. Went to a nearby destination for weekend holiday and we took a deliberate detour. En-route we crossed few dirt roads just to feel the drive. Yes i was satisfied with the ride and so were all the occupants in the car. The car was soaked in dust and the suspension soaked the bumps quite well. I have also crossed this road in my Ritz and this time in Vitara i felt more confident more so even with few considerably bad patches courtesy culvert cleaning and drain work in progress. My cousin who Drives a Koleos was of the opinion that rear seat is comfortable and space is class leading.While we were enjoying the views we were wondering what is more important, GC or the size of the tyres. I think it is the size of the Tyre which is more important along decent Ground Clearance to make the car feel planted and settled firmly on uneven surface.

Hopefully Breeza satisfies those needs. I don't know if i can compare Brezza with Honda City, but frankly speaking the type of Comfort (Drive and ride) Honda City can give is unmatched. Brezza is more like a big hatchback which is having stance of a SUV and can do well in basic off-roads. Regarding Space and Boot as compared with Swift, you will find it much more comfortable for a family and can easily seat 3 in the back bench on those long trips. Safety is a very vast subject and individual observation and requirement may differ.Car has all the safety kits installed and i feel it is as safe as any other car in this price point.

IMHO you should check out the various options on the computer before directly getting the mod done. But I would prefer a wrap over the paint job. I believe the dealers (most of them) will be incompetent of giving a good paint finish on the roof top. We can pick out the specialised people for the custom paint job, which would run over 15-16 grand easily. My pick would be a wrap with different finish than a glossy one. Matt wouldn't go along the glossy red so probably a carbon fibre finished wrap. 3M one's for carbon finish one's cost around 400-500 Rs/sqft so they might end up north of 13K for brezza. MSIL should have offered dual tone at least for zdi if not for all the variants! @Dr. Naren - The dealer is quoting is 12-14k for the paint job so I am okay with the 3M pricing if its 8-10k. @Bhansali - Thanks.

222, arun_josie , 11:48 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Last weekend I got a chance to check and test drive Brezza as I tagged along with my friend who is in the market for a new car. We decided to visit Suraksha, Electronic City. Here are the few things which I observed, I was impressed with the driver seat view. When on the road you really get a feel of an SUV and bonnet is clearly visible as well Loads of head room even if you increase the height of the seat to max.(I am 510) NVH is very well managed. And I feel, 100-110 will be the sweet spot on the highway. Smooth clutch and gear movements It was quick to 100 and very well planted even while doing some quick lane changes. Probably the bigger tires are helping here. As few have already mentioned, these 16 inch rim and 215 tires really enhances the look of the car as well. And braking was good too. We took it to some real bad roads, and I felt that this car handled it really well. There was one pot hole which was sharp, it gave a thud sound, firm suspension may be. I couldn't find a similar pothole again. But overall, it handled well on bad roads. Very spacious inside, especially the rear seat space. But I was not happy with the under thigh support in the rear seat, I felt the same in Ciaz as well. My friend was happy though with the under thigh support. Ingress/Egress was very convenient It was really good to see the spare wheel comes with the same size even though without alloys.(I have seen top end Vento and Sunny with smaller tire size for spare wheels). Decent boot size and can be increased if you remove the tray USB port and AUX were positioned conveniently, especially when compared to my Linea which has it inside the glove box. Multiple options for storage, I loved it, especially the bottle holders on all the doors. Its a pain to carry bottles in my linea because of NO bottle holders. AC was very chilling and the fan speed was not noisy even when the temperature was set at 18 degrees. Outside temperature should have been around 35 or above You get 5 colour option for the analogue dials (tachometer & speedometer), this is a nice feature and easy to handle this setting. I was not really comfortable with IRVM and the rear view. It will require some time to get used/adjusted to. They could have offered leather seating on the dual tone models at least. Overall, for a first time buyer or for someone who is coming from a lower segment, this car for sure has a lot to offer. Even comparing with a Swift, this car comes with loads of feature, space, along with very good ground clearance, wide and bigger tires, SUVish feel etc. Regarding the dual tone colour, what a master stroke from Maruti! At this dealership, around 80% bookings are for top end dual tone. If this is true then I am not sure when a top end model had such a demand in Maruti stable. And finally when I told my friend that we can check-out Ecosport as well, he said I am booking brezza. Yes, he has already done enough research and checked out Ecosport as well and said, Brezza is the one for him. He is not a teambhpian yet, but he has reviewed all the information/feedback about both Brezza and Ecosport here. He has also taken feedback from his other friends who own Ecosport and Figo. He went ahead and booked a red dual tone Brezza and now the toughest part has begun for him, the waiting. This is my first visit to Suraksha, I was impressed. This was the car at the display, This is the test drive car with around 2500Km in the ODO, they have also fitted it with some extra accessories and some stickering job..

227, Agnijit , 19:26 ,BHPian,"Excellent Post and Review of the Vitara Brezza. Much Awaited. We went for the test drive of Vitara Brezza on Saturday. It was the Yellow- White Top end ZDI+ for the test drive and had clocked 1300 Kms approx. As mentioned earlier, I have booked the Red-Black ZDI+ and I am upgrading from my 2008 Alto LXI. So things from my perspective - 1. This Compact SUV, is well proportioned. It does not look like something is chopped off it or something missing. 2. Visibly its a big Vehicle and does not disappoint with its impressions. 3. Alto is a basic car (has and is serving us well) but if you look at everything overall; Vitara Brezza is an upgrade in all aspects. Gizmos, power, size, space, road presence, Ground clearance, tyres, etc... 4. The vehicle had just returned from a test drive and the engine was running. Though outside there was the diesel engine clatter, on the inside it was pretty stable and vibration free. Hardly any noise inside. 5. Press the Clutch; and wow! its super smooth. Slotting gears was not a hassle at all and the vehicle starts without any hiccups. 6. There was traffic and initial 300 meters I slotted it into second and without any A-Pedal input let it just glide. It went over a few patchy roads and paver blocks, but was pretty well controlled inside. 7. Post that got chance to accelerate and compared to the Alto, this one is miles ahead. To me there was nothing called as a Turbo Lag. Yes but once past the 1800 RPM mark the acceleration was even quicker. Was thinking if the Alto engine always runs in Turbo Lag mode . I now realized what 150% increase in Cubic Capacity of the engine and 2X the power means. 8. It was a 6Km Test drive, and I came out of the car very happy post this drive. Happy with my decision to book this vehicle on just the pics and online feedback. 9. I could see the bonnet while driving, the reverse cam and sensors came into play as soon as I slotted the Reverse Gear, my smart phone paired well and played songs, call logs on the screen, i can go on (Super Impressed) 10. Tyres are great and look excellent. Interiors... Yes, better than Alto. Good Space all around. My Opinion, its an Ideal upgrade for me. I read lots of feedback on the flimsy and not upto the mark Interiors; but I will reserve this opinion for the next upgrade I do. Now just waiting for my Car.", 18th April 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Mumbai,37,59

231, VRPAI , 23:17 ,BHPian,"IMO The Brezza and the Creta are from two different segments.In no way can these be compared exept for maybe the SUVish styling and GC which both these cars have. Creta is a segment higher in all aspects and it does cost more as well. The SUVish look and GC , that's where the comparison starts and ends too. Creta is ages ahead in terms of quality of interiors,fit and finish,refinement, space etc etc. Comparing both these cars isn't fair if you ask me. It's like comparing an amaze/xcent to a City/Verna. Yes one could say both are ""sedans"".And you could get a 80-85% of the city in an amaze at 65-70%of the cost.

232, deetjohn , 08:43 ,Senior - BHPian,"Checked the Brezza out a few days back as I was in the vicinity of a dealer (Sai, Edapally) and had a bit of time. Couldn't drive as their TD car was doing the rounds. Guess, they don't have to keep the demo car at showroom for the Brezza to sell. Very easy to get in and out. It has the perfect height for aged parents. The seats were a size smaller than our Swift (second gen). While its fine for short runs, I guess people will start noticing it a bit more during longer trips. The fabric felt nice and the pattern is similar to the one in older Fiesta (Global). The short seats leave a lot of room on the inside, both front and rear. The headrests are really slim and looks funny. I didn't like the shade of plastics or the texture on closer inspection. The Swift (second gen) gets proper black and Brezza was a darker shade of grey. I think the quality of plastics in the Swift is also a little better. The upper glovebox lid is badly executed and feels el cheapo. MSIL should fix that immediately. Should have been the visual treat that the cup holder was in the Swift. The clutch like all Maruti diesels was super light but the shift was a bit notchy. But that should be okay once the run in is completed. The boot is nicely designed and totally usable. And good of MSIL to offer a full sized spare. The waiting period was 4 months across the variants irrespective of the colour.", 19th April 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Kochi,"4,530","10,580"

Probably the dealer there in AMD had less bookings when compared to your dealer. MSIL will try fulfilling their dealer network, who in turn will fulfill your demand. So, they wouldn't be cheating you on that front. I had a chat with my SA and he was able to provide me clear details of how the system works. The dealer would feed an order on the online management system, which is centrally used by MSIL. On the database they can alter the details of your address or the spelling of the name used for booking provided you have substantial proof. Added to it, when the car is despatched from the factory it would bear a tag to your name to the dealer. Only if you cancel the booking/ask for a delay the dealer would be eligible to transfer the booking.

Hope its just the run in period. I think it should be run in period and I have following to add. I have felt that recently (since last two days) the gears are getting more eager to go into the slot by just showing them the direction with soft hand. Earlier I felt that though gear was super soft but when I use to slot them the effort was a bit more, means the throw required was more. To explain again let us assume I am trying to slot car in gear no. 3, I press the clutch, and with soft hand push the lever to slot the gear in position 3. I needed to push it just a little more and it will fit into the slot. Now since last two days I feel that when I press clutch and push the lever to slot it in position 3 the gear is eager to go into the slot and it feels as if there is a suction force which is helping it do it comfortably. I don't know if I am helping you or just confusing you further but I feel this run in period.

Well the first service is just a check up to ensure that the oil, coolant and other liquid levels are alright. They also check if all the electricals are working fine. Yes, they do a wash as well. Nothing else is done to the car. If you go through the owners manual there is a checklist for each service. Go through that and you would get a fair idea of what exactly is done. As for the oil change, I would suggest stick to the regular mineral oil till at least 10K and post that you can move over to the synthetic ones.

I share the same views. I really appreciate the car manufacturers who provide basic stuff like rear headrests and tachometer across the variants. And then there are carmakers who do not provide adjustable headrests at all, like the Honda City. This is now becoming a trend with the Ciaz and the Verna following the suit( the international variants of both the City and the Verna get adjustable head rests). Even the i20 provides adjustable head rests only in the top-variant. Maruti has gone a step ahead by not giving even fixed head rests at the rear for the LDI. You may want to have a chat with the accessories manager/seat cover guy. If that doesn't work out, then perhaps you can visit some local shops. If none of these work out, the best solution would be to replace the rear seat completely with that of the higher variants. I think it should be plug and play.

284, razor4077 , 18:28 ,Senior - BHPian,"Took a TD of the Brezza ZDI+ today. Some thoughts: - Car has a compact footprint, similar to a big hatchback - this actually makes it perfect for in-city usage - Insides are surprisingly spacious for a car that's so compact. The width in the rear, especially, is great (unlike an Ecosport). Good leg room, shoulder room and head room all around. I could sit comfortably in the back seat with the front seat all the way back, as is my preferred position (I'm 6') - Dashboard has lots of common elements with the S Cross like the steering and touchscreen AVN system. Very functional dash - no wow factor, but plastics felt decent. Black plastic frame around the HU looks cheap and is prone to oily fingerprints. - El cheapo Swift power window switches present here too. ORVM switch is a very old design, but does the job - Great driving position and visibility; front seats are nice and supportive. Like the S Cross, I felt the pedals were a little high, which required me to keep my feet slightly pulled back and could cause strain over a long drive. - Familiar 1.3L MJD engine. Not the most powerful, but adequate for city driving. Turbo lag not an issue - Ride is comfortable for the most part but suspension felt stiffer than most Marutis, and the bigger potholes were felt in the cabin. Not as pliant as the Duster or Creta but decent. Couldn't really test the handling in the limited TD. - Boot isn't very spacious - Rear seats have 60:40 split and fold flat - nice and practical - Ground clearance is excellent - Looks nice from the outside but not imposing Overall, came back impressed with the Brezza. It's a great urban SUV with a decent engine, solid space, nice looks and lots of practicality.

293, humyum , 23:32 ,Senior - BHPian,"Took a longer test drive of the Brezza today, will focus just on the drive part of my observations, as rest of the details I am sure you guys already know. 1) The seating position is high, and the visibility of the bonnet does give it a big car feel from inside 2) The power delivery is like how the old Swifts used to be, but with rev happiness added to the mixture. After I think 2000 rpm, there is a shove in the seat sudden pull and its not linear like how the newer Swifts have. 3) It picks up speed very very rapidly. I was on a LBS Marg near R City taking a test drive and before I even realised, one shift to 3rd from 2nd and I was at 80. That's insane. 4) I purposely let it fly over some road undulations and most of them I could not feel, yes hard ones do filter in though but that is all right considering the hard ones were really big ones on which I would slow down to 5 kmph on my Swift. 5) The gearshifts felt a bit notchy, the car had run 260 km, strange. Never felt this in a 50 km run Creta. 6) Handling was superb. Nothing to complain at all. 7) This one looks good only in a few colors, and to check how it looks, I advice letting someone drive the Brezza and you follow it in another car to get a real feel of how the car looks. For example, In white, I really liked how she looked in the pictures, until I followed one on the highway and really did not like it at all from behind. 8) The Dual Tone ZDI + is too overpriced. Does not seem worth 11.64 On Road Mumbai, that's my opinion though. Interiors do not feel like a 11.5 lakh car. 9) Would I buy one ? Well, like they say in Gujarati "" Modi Levi Pan Audi Levi"", which when translated means 'Buy Late, But Buy and Audi"". I ll wait some more to save up on the Creta is how I feel right now.", 22nd April 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Mumbai,"2,747","5,416"

In terms of payment, are people paying the full amount pst PDI, or on the day of delivery? Thanks in advance! Hi, Congratulation for your brezza in advance. As brezza is launched just a few weeks back, I don't think there is anything to worry regarding the manufacturing month/year. It shouldn't be older than couple of months. I got delivery of my Brezza zdi+ couple of days back,25th April, (will upload pics soon) and I paid full amount on 22nd April before PDI. I was told that there is 99% probability that my Brezza would arrive at the stockyard on 23rd morning and I would get delivery by afternoon but the car reached stockyard in the evening. We waited for Brezza till afternoon and then left for the weekend trip in Jetta hence delivery on the 25th. Coming back to your question, I was reluctant about paying the full amount before PDI but considering the facts that it's a very fresh MARUTI product and the dealershipe sells 1000+ cars every month, I trusted the dealership with the full payment before PDI. (I booked a duster in Feb and made it clear to my SA that I would do the full payment only after the car gets ready for the delivery, not even after PDI. PS: I cancelled the booking and went for Brezza). If you have booked from a well known dealer, you can go ahead with the payment before PDI but do NOT sign delivery note (or anything regarding the delivery) and ask your SA NOT to generate any invoice before you are 100% satisfied with the car (Paint, washing, 5 tyres, electronics stuff and documents should be main focus) on the delivery day. Good luck with the delivery.

The info that the dealer got after dispatch had my name associated with the VIN of the vehicle.

As of now, there is absolutely no chance of the 1.6L going into the Vitara Brezza's engine bay. Among other reasons, it's fully imported and the cost implications will be high.

At 1195 kgs for the top spec variants, it is only 5kg heavier than the top end variant of the Punto Evo.

The Ecosport might be older, but if you ask me, it still looks better. The Brezza has a conservative design and only the top end dual tone variants are attention grabbers. How often do you need to carry 5 people in the car? If it less than 10% of the times, then there is no need to make the backseat width a priority. Otherwise, yes, the Brezza would be better in this sense. The major plus point for Maruti is its A.S.S. However, I can see that you already own a Figo and if your experience with Ford A.S.S. has been decent, then I think that you should go ahead with the Ecosport.

I had booked zdi on the day the car booking officialy opened and got delivery on the march month end. My father recently took Brezza to manali and surprisingly was frustrated as he said due to the excessive turbo lag ( maybe coz its a new car) and he constantly had to drop down to 1st gear on inclines.

One of my close friends have had terrible experience with Rohan about a 10 years back of Rohan delivering a lemon Zen and then it was a huge tussel between them for almost six months. Rohan is one of the worst places to buy a car IMHO. I drive a Swift D and I have driven it for almost 7 years and over 1Lac Kms so I am quite familiar with the turbo lag. The problem for me is not the turbo lag, rather I like my car with all the gadgets. The Breeza offers me that with a good driving position and is in my budget. No other car offers me this. My consideration for Scorpio is mainly because of the stance, driving position and build quality. I think interiors would be on par with Breeza, but the gadgets will go away with my budget.

Thanks I have driven the Ecosport recently up the Jalori pass from the Shoja side - needed to climb in 1st gear throughout, on some inclines there was wheel spin due to unpaved surface. If starting from zero speed, invariably a lot of clutch slipping was needed to get the engine above 2000 rpm in first gear - showing low end torque was falling short.

If possible, use the insurance judiciously after the second year, since the NCB can greatly reduce your premium on your next car.

Even I was very frustrated by the doors not unlocking after I switch off the engine and pressing the request sensor button twice to unlock all doors. These settings can be customized by long pressing the right stalk on the instrument cluster ( Make sure you do the long press when the display for this MID is in current/dynamic avg fuel efficiency setting, if it is in the average fuel efficiency setting, it just resets the average ). You get different option setting for doors/security and lighting. I have currently set my settings to 1. Unlock all doors by pressing the request sensor only once - door settings 2. Unlock all doors when the engine is switched off - door settings 3. Keep footwell lamp on when headlamps are on - Light settings. There is also an option to reset all these settings to default. You would have to keep the manual handy as these settings are displayed as codes in the console. The explanation of these codes are given in the manual. The SA's have some sort of training on the vehicle and are expected to convey all this information during delivery, but this seldom happens. It looked like I had more info than the SA due to reading the exhaustive reviews and comments here.", 5th May 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Bangalore,95,137

Even I was very frustrated by the doors not unlocking after I switch off the engine and pressing the request sensor button twice to unlock all doors. The request sensors are designed with multiple programming and there is a safety aspect associated with it. One set of programming is that, if you press the request sensor once, only that door will be unlocked. If you press twice, all the doors will be unlocked. For me, When I'm alone, I do not want all the doors to be unlocked when I'm getting into the car in a crowded place. So, I can press the request sensor on the driver's door once and get in. (Similarly, one press on the keyfob unlocks the driver door and if pressed twice, all the doors unlocks) Other aspect of unlocking the doors when the engine is switched off is also comes with a safety aspect. When I'm travelling with kids in city traffic, If I switch off the engine I do not want the doors to be unlocked by it's own. I put the unlocking of doors as manual. (Using the child lock on rear doors is another safety option when travelling with kids, but it may not be convenient in all the situations.) Another aspect to consider doors getting unlocked when engine is switched off. If we are travelling (alone) in cities and have valuable things kept in rear / front passenger seats, like Laptop / Mobile phones etc, when the car is switched off in signals, all the doors get unlocked. There are many incidents reported of the thefts happening at the traffic signals. To avoid these, I prefer the unlocking of doors as manual rather than auto unlock at the ignition switch off.", 6th May 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Bangalore,811,"1,002"

405, bhavik.1991 , 12:48 ,BHPian,"Hello guys, Had my Brezza delivered on 25th April. Odo reads 1180kms now, handed over her to service station guys at 8 am. (Kudos to Kiran Motors, Ahmedabad workshop for extended timings of 7am to 9pm) Though service information SMS reads estimated delivery time 5pm, SE is hopeful to get the servicing done by 2pm. Will share the service experience once I get her back. Here are my observations regarding the car so far. Will share buying process in Initial Ownership report. Though paint quality is far better, build quality is just a notch better than my first gen Swift Dzire and leagues behind her German garage-mate 6th gen VW Jetta. Interior quality is far better than first gen Swift Dzire. I have been inside Baleno and S-Cross's cabin for couple of hours. Overall it feel a notch better than Baleno's and a notch lower than S-Cross' interior quality. Sound quality is a little better than first gen Swift Dzire. (Two tweeter of ZDi+ helps the cause) FE for first 250kms with AC on full time: 15.7kmpl. (50% city, 50% highway, 90% 1000-2000rpm, 9% 2000-2500rpm, 1% 2500-3000rpm). Hope it will improve after the servicing. Things I love about the car.Exteriors with Dual tone Red-black, looks indeed glamours. Excellent Ride quality. Reminds me of GTO's observation regarding Duster: ""Dismisses broken roads with aplomb"". Well, 90% aplomb when compared with Duster/Terrano but better than Ecosport/Creta. Silent suspension. I have driven her to some VERY bad patches. Driving position. Gives a proper suv-like view while driving. Bikers, auto wallahs and pedestrians don't bully unlike when I drive Jetta Voice commands, works perfectly on almost all the occasions. Things I like about the car.Breaking. Does 120-0kmph without a fuss, leagues ahead of first gen Swift Dzire Vdi. Air-con, again leagues ahead of first gen Swift Dzire, as good as Jetta's. Front seats. I am a 6'1"" and large built person. Though I was a little skeptical about front seat comfort before the purchase(99% time she would carry no more than 2 persons, so rear bench is no concern), cushioning and fabric quality is really good. Seat width is OK. Under thigh support could be better, it's average, not poor. Refined, fuel-efficient and powerful engine with good driveability. Turbo lag is very well controlled, far better than first gen Swift Dzire though it's a little annoying in higher gears. Overall acceleration feels a bit better than first gen Swift Dzire. Mood lights, really enhances driving experience. Parking aid. Sub 4m length, reverse camera and sensor make it very easy to park compared with Jetta. Other Gizmos. Things I don't like about the car. Steering is the same as the first gen swift Dzire except for mounted controls which feel good and NOT cheap unlike their house. Rattles. It rattles from left of Dashboard and left back side. Hope it will get fixed during the service. I am really disappointed that she has started rattling only after 1000 kms. In MSIL's defence, she has gone through some very rough patches but still it's not a valid excuse. Gearbox. Sometimes I have to try 2-3 times to engage the reverse gear just like first gen Swift Dzire. Other gearshifts are not smooth as well. SE told me that he would check clutch bleeding but it's a typical 'Maruti Characteristic' and it would remain there. Does anyone else face the same issue? Though door are very thin, one need to put lots of efforts to close them(from inside as well as outside). The fifth door feels a bit heavy, it's no exception in closing efforts. Nose dive. As mentioned in official review, it occurs during breaking even from medium speeds but doesn't make the car lose its composure during hard breaking. No leather stuff even in the top variant: Bull horn LED at front is only visible during night, not even during evening. Read one can easily be spotted during evening but it's nowhere as bright as Baleno's DRL and invisible during day time. Noise insulation. It's strictly average however not as bad as S-Cross'. Horns, reminds me of Premier Padmini. ", 7th May 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Pune/Ahmedabad,365,483

430, Vid6639 , 22:54 ,Team-BHP Support,"Got a slightly longish test drive of the Brezza today vs the earlier short one. Overall the package is good but nothing special. It does a little bit of everything well but not great in any one aspect. There's no one wow factor. Concentrating on the drive factor: - Very easy to drive. Found it easier to potter around than my Ecosport. The controls felt lighter to use. - There is turbo lag but it isn't that bad. Manageable. Ecosport is slightly better at low rpm's. - Engine has better punch than the Ecosport post 2,000rpm. Pulls freely till redline. - Maruti have hit a sweet spot in ride/handling. The Brezza is far more compliant than the Ecosport but doesn't lose out too much in the corners when pushed hard. The Ford turns in sharper but at the cost of ride. The Brezza is very pliant over poor roads however you still feel the stiffness and it will thud over the sharper and bigger bumps. - Steering feel is missing. The Ecosport has a light steering but has some feedback vs the Brezza. - NVH is very average. The Ecosport has no diesel clatter all through out the rev range whereas you can hear the Brezza clatter from idle. It gets obtrusive as revs climb. The Ecosport also isolates the outside better than the Brezza. - ORVM's were poor in visibility. More than twice I lost a biker on my left due to the blind spot. The mirrors are not wide and the Ecosport probably has the best ORVM's out there which are not only wide but have 2 levels of convexity with the outer edge being even more convex. Overall the Brezza does tick a lot of boxes but it's more of a head decision. The Ecosport appeals a little more to the heart.", 11th May 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Bangalore,"17,716","43,228"

I prefer the stand out styling of the Ecosport vs the safer styling of Brezza. The Ecosport is not perfect as well but has some wow elements which is what makes it stand out. Space wise, I actually found the front seats more accommodating in the Ecosport vs the smaller seats of the Brezza. The wow factors for me in the Ecosport were the build quality and solid feel from the time you open the doors, interior styling, equipment like leather seats and most importantly 6 airbags.

438, bhansali_hardik , 15:57 ,BHPian,"Well, got my car back from the first service and the odo reads 1200kms now. Few pointers on my takecoming from a swift petrol driver (which I still love taking out) it was very tough to cope up with the turbo lag initially. However when you work around the gears and learn to keep it in the right range between your shifts it is an ease to cope up with the lag. Have kept it below 2k rpm and will ne pushing it between 2-2.5k for next 1K. Which of course will make it more fun! Driving it in the traffic! Well, it would be tough I thought given the lag. But you get used to handle it and in second it handles the traffic with breeze and I'm surprised how easy it has been to maneuver it. Dead pedal on my highway run was bliss, however I feel it's too close to the clutch lever to my liking. Get's annoying during frequent shifts. The music system on zdi comes with 4 speakers and the age old head unit. I wasn't expecting much from the stalk and had the plans to get components and an amp fixed. However, I was surprised! After playing around with settings and setting up the HU. I am more than satisfied with the output and I do not feel the necessity to upgrade it yet! Bluetooth functionality might be a little annoying to setup initially, once connected works just fine and the calls do not drop if the car turns off. However, the music system does! (Tiago's system is best I have seen on any car in recent). Air con is just amazing! In the scorching heat of bangalore this year, it kept us cool with an ease even at low fan speeds. The flip seats are very handy in the tight parking spaces to get the stuff out from the boot. They function well. The under seat storage, under the front passenger seat is a little flimsy doesn't get locked easily. Will be getting a 3MCR70 on my wind shields, as the cooling gets uneven due to the sun. I want a black roof, folks back at home don't! Still fighting over to come to a conclusion. All in all, I am happy with the car and yes it does grab attention on road. Even though most of the people don't agree to this fact. But, I have been asked about it by a few on goers and also have been requested by few people to look inside.

460, RavenAvi , 12:25 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"The Vitara Brezza has enabled Maruti-Suzuki to grab a healthy 26% of the overall utility vehicle market in the past 2 months. It's a rise of over 11% for the numero uno domestic auto giant since the Brezza was launched. Comparatively, Mahindra & Mahindra has lost over 6% of it's UV market share despite 3 big launches in recent times - the TUV300, the KUV100 & the NuvoSport. Quote: Analysts expect Maruti to be able to maintain its share at the current level as the newly-launched Brezza has got over 50,000 bookings till end-April, which could mean a run-rate of around 8,000 units for the next six months. The gain in market share in a segment with higher margins is expected to be an overall positive for Maruti, even if it has witnessed sales decline in the entry-level mini segment which contributes to one-third of its volumes. Analysts are now looking at Maruti as an upgrade brand, compared to a previous description of first-time buyers choice. Maruti has not only credibly maintained its market share over the past few years now, but has in our view earned an upgrade brand status. One key concern with Maruti has always been the perception that it is primarily a first time buyers choice, but less of an aspirational brand, HSBC recently said in a report. But with new launches such as Ciaz, Baleno, S-Cross and Vitara Brezza, it has started to attract the attention of upgrade buyers as well.

On Monday morning, I googled Maruti's Regional office, Delhi's contact number, called them, got greeted by an operator, who after figuring out that I'm calling regarding sales from Noida, routed me to a guy, who heard my case, and then told me to send in a deed to the dealer, certifying my relationship with my employer (in whose name the car is to be leased). He further went on to say that if you run into any issues wrt this, just ask them to call me up on xxx phone number and gave his office land line number. Wow! All of this in less than 90 seconds ! That was quick! I called up my SA, and briefed him on my conversation, email him the documents. Get a call from dealer's Head of sales in an hour confirming that they've got formal approval from Maruti, and I can proceed with the lease process. Now, I'm waiting for the lease formalities to be completed. Hopefully, I should be able to lay my hands on her by Monday. Fingers crossed ", 17th May 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Bengaluru,93,87

467, C'estlavie , 09:12 ,BHPian,"Just got back from an approximately 600 km Delhi Dehradun round trip (including in-city driving) in my Brezza VDi (O). These were my observations, in no particular order 1. The vehicle is very easy to drive in congested city spaces. The commanding driver position and the fact that one can see the bonnet are key factors. The car feels simple to turn and manoeuvre. 2. Not sure if this is because it's a new car, but the Brezza gets noticed and lorries/ cars/ autos don't cut one off as I got used to driving sedans. Perhaps its because when seen from the front and the back, the Brezza looks like a vehicle in a larger category, and the tyre size adds to the effect. It's only when seen from the side that one gets the actual picture about it's size. 3. I kept it at 80kmph and less mostly- am uncomfortable above those speeds anyway- and given my sedate driving style, it handled well on the highway. 4. NVH is ok- better than S Cross (IMO) but not as good as (say) the Zest or vehicles in a higher class. 5. It takes bumps and rough roads quite well- not Duster well, but so far IU haven't found a lot to complain about. 6. AC is just superb. I usually go on full AC in all my cars- this one, I now come down to the halfway slot after 10 minutes of use. 7. 10-15 km just before Dehradun one has to take a minor hilly stretch. The vehicle handled itself well- felt planted, but I will want a lot more of mountain driving before I can comment. 8. Put a lot of luggage at the back- it was easily done. On the whole I am pleased with my purchase. It's the right combination of city/ highway capability, spacious insides 'SUV like' presence, utility, pricing and looks. Not being # 1 in any particular metric, it is sufficiently highly ranked in a number of key areas to make it my # 1 choice. The Brezza will be my go to vehicle for a long time. An automatic in the future around a reasonable price point will really impact this category even more, IMO. Edit: Unrelated comment, but I also was up in the Uttarakhand hills in the same time (left the Brezza in Dehradun). Of all the vehicles I saw, the Duster appeared to be the finest combination of capability, looks, size and utility up there", 18th May 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Delhi,131,97

I am familiar with the engine as I drive a Ritz VDi but found the Brezza much more refined and insulated in the cabin. It touched 120 KM/hr instantly before I realized and felt quite stable. I am sure it is an excellent product considering the overall package. I may be biased as I have booked it but trust me, this looks to be a better package as compared to the Ecosport or the Creta or the Duster. It looks to me the best in its segment and matches up on almost all aspects if not better as compared to the Creta or the Duster.

The customers placing their orders for the LDi, LDi (O), VDi and VDi (O) will have their cars delivered in December 2016 or January 2017. The top-end variants (ZDi (O) and ZDi+) account for about 50% of the total number of bookings received. These variants have a waiting period of 9 months. Since its launch on March 8, 2016, the Vitara Brezza has received a great response in the Indian market. The company sold 7,832 units of the car in the month of April. Other reports also indicate that the production of the Swift hatchback and the Dzire compact sedan have been cut down to increase the production of the Vitara Brezza and the Baleno. The Baleno was launched in October 2015. Maruti Suzuki managed to sell over 9,562 units of the car in April. The increasing sales of the Vitara Brezza and the Baleno might have caused the company to reduce the production of the Swift and the Dzire. The Vitara Brezza and Baleno are more profitable. Maruti Suzuki had planned to manufacture 1,00,000 units of the Brezza annually. The company is on track to achieve this number. It plans to cope with the demand by the second half of the year.

I acknowledge the natural tendency to justify your choices in hindsight, i.e. we like the cars we own because we bought them in the first place. But having said that I'm very happy with the car. It qualifies the two crucial tests of ownership for me: (a) I look for excuses to drive even in Delhi traffic, whereas before this for three years after returning from the US taking my my Nissan Micra out anywhere was a chore. Driving the Brezza is - for me- calm inducing, I take my time, don't bother or mind being cut off (happens rarely). Whereas on the Micra I was always nervy, jostling for space, and perpetually irritated. Perhaps the new welcome sensation will also go in a few months, but in the meantime I'm enjoying myself. (b) Every time I get out of the car I can't resist looking back with pride/ admiration. For most of you that should be self- explanatory, but for those who're not familiar with a this rule of ownership here goes - If you don't catch yourself looking back at a newly acquired car every time you walk away from it, it's probably not a car you should be owning.", 29th May 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Delhi,131,97

Dear Prasanna, My experience- Even if the engine is same the state of troque and fuel delivery (commonly called as fuel map) is different for different vehicles Eg- the Amaze and the City have the same calibration. But the M&M vehicles sharing a common engine (eg 2.5l bolero in its multiple variants) shares a different calibration for its models.

I keep the revs anywhere between 1.8-2.5 k. Range where the engine comes to life and is fun to drive! I treid doing that but that didnt work for some odd reason? Is it the right stalk that you have to long press? And for how long is the press? Tankfull method being used here as well. Havent taken it on a long high way run yet to ascertain mileage at lateral speeds but in the city i'm getting a 16.5 solid driving in mostly non traffic hours and keeping revs between 1.8 to 2.8k Quote: Originally Posted by anycatd You have to use the knobs on the head unit to select a name to dial.

When I press the call button on steering, it takes me to bluetooth setup, and not to the phonebook. Anybody here can share how to use it? Also, does anybody have link to soft copy of the user manual? MS website hasn't been updated with the brezza's manual yet. Following steps to make voice calls using buttons on the steering wheel. 1. connect phone using Bluetooth 2. Phone will prompt to download phone book to the HU. Just allow. 3. Press the first button on wheel meant for voice command. 4.A voice System will prompt for choices like call navigation etc. 5. Say Call 99123456789 for example 6. Voice will repeat the number and if ok say yes 7. Call will be connected and you can disconnect the call using the third button. 8. If you want to make call using phonebook provided it is downloaded. Say Call and the name you have stored after you invoke voice command. 9. Voice may give you options if there are more than one similar names. 10 just choose the line number from the options using voice command and call will be placed. 11.

The highway drive was with 5 people in the car and the car was pushed a little harder during this run to break in the engine for higher revs!

The Nexa guys are also saying the same thing. The latest news is that the Swift/Dzire production has been cut back to accomodate the Baleno and the Brezza. This thread has been most informative, with all of you new buyers giving valuable inputs. However, there are still no ownership reviews of the Brezza yet, and I request the new owners to find some time to start their ownership threads. I know most of you will be too busy actually driving them and having fun, but it would be highly beneficial to prospective buyers. The price of the LDi(O) here in Trivandrum is about 8.3 lacs OTR. The next variant with ABS/Airbags comes at 9.2 lacs OTR. Is the extra lakh worth it? Amazingly, the ZDi that comes almost fully loaded with all essentials, is only 70k more than the VDi(o).

Just a little surprised to read some of the stuff you've written. I was shopping between the highest variants on both vehicles and went for the Ecosport. I understand you're looking at lower variants but a few things will remain common. It is in fact the Ecosport that has the larger boot, and if you drive them back to back, it just feels a lot more solid and refined.

Brezza was no match, same confirmed by my Dad who was in passenger seat and is an experienced driver for last 40 plus years. Unlike the WagonR which has H4 headlight bulbs with dual filament for H/L beam, the Vitara has separate bulbs for h/l beam, and probably has both high and low beams on when high beam is selected. While upgrading such a setup, it'll cost more to upgrade the wiring, as two kits will be needed. I faced the same issue in my Indigo which has the same dual beam setup. If you do the wiring and upgrade to 100w, you'll end up replacing four bulbs instead of two, and the setup will draw 400w+ when high beam is on. A better and possibly cheaper option overall would be to go for HID setup for the low beam projector (if you have ZDi), or replace all the bulbs with high output bulbs like the Osram Nightbreakers or Philips Extremevision. Of the two, I've found Osrams to be supremely reliable and noticeably brighter. This has the additional advantage of not messing around with the original wiring, or adding new clamps and wiring to the battery and engine area.

Well, I don't need 185 width for my Indigo either. It does absolutely fine on the stock 175s. I just wanted some because they looked better, and I was willing to make the tradeoff in FE for the additional grip and possibly longer life. The 205/60 looks slightly undertyred on the Brezza. The 215 on the ZDi and above look about right as it's taller. There's already a 2% difference between the LDi/VDi and ZDi, which is very weird.

Please refer the below link for details. http://www.carbibles.com/tyre_bible_pg3.html If your upgrade is not into a softer compound compared to the stock tyres, you may not be getting any substantial increase in grip by a wider tyre.

IMO, there isn't enough in the VDi(o) variant to make it worth the extra lakh. Am I right, or is there something I'm missing here? Your thoughts on this are welcome. The difference between VDi (O) and LDi (O) in Delhi was around Rs 70k, for what its worth.

Now to the rest of my reasoning. IMO what car you choose is all about tradeoffs, and what you are absolutely not willing to give up. That is how it works for me, but obviously other people may think differently. Key security features were common to both models (airbags, ABS, EBD, BA). However, I was completely unwilling to give up the following features present in VDi(o) but not in LDi(o) - Power windows - front and rear, - Remote lock - Speed sensing door lock - roof rails There were other added on features, but these three were my absolute must haves. Were they worth Rs 70k? To me they were. To many people they won't be. But I somehow could not stand the idea of having an 8-9lakh car without power windows or a remote lock. Now let's up the comparison to Zdi. These are the 'larger' (am not listing all) features that a ZDi has that are not present in VDi(o). Price difference is Rs 70k. - Automatic climate control versus manual ac - Driver seat height adjustment -Rear seat armrest -Rear seat 60:40 split -Rear defogger -Rear wiper -Bunch of instrumentation and entertainment options Except for the rear seat armrest, I'm ok not having any of the above. Were they worth and additional Rs 70k cash down to me? Nope. To someone else they would be absolutely worth it. All the above is based on the fact that I paid cash down- however it is possible that if I were taking a loan I'd likely purchase the ZDi! Over a 5-6 year purchase, Rs 70k isn't much. But then if I were taking a loan why not buy the top end model, ZDi+ and be done with it? A further Rs 1 lakh isn't all that much either over a 5-6 year loan window. The arguments are endless.

Use 1 inch or 2 inch wide good quality cellotape to cover the entire sticker, press down on the logo to attach it to the tape and it should peel off along with the cellotape. You can also use the defogger to heat up the glass around the logo and see if it comes off easier. Or, use a hair dryer to heat the logo specifically. It should peel right off. Some solvent might be needed to remove the glue. Quote: Originally Posted by BoneCollector Had gone for 1st service of Brezza, and work took about 3 hrs.

Quote: Originally Posted by BoneCollector The center well looks deep enough to house an AWD system. Experts, is it so? I'm no expert, but it seems you're right. Since the Brezza is based on the global Vitara platform, it is logical that the floorpan would be able to accomodate an AWD system. I am doubtful about it MSIL ever offering it here though. Quote: Originally Posted by BoneCollector 3. If there is so much space in the well, why have they not fitted the silencer there? One thing that comes to my mind is that a silencer would reduce the ground clearance if located in that well. Since they already reached the required ground clearance, it might be more economical from a manufacturing perspective, to save on additional heat/sound insulation that would be required if the exhaust pipe were that close to the underbody. As it is, it seems that they have used the middle tunnel to route the exhaust, while keeping clearance from the body itself.", 20th June 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Trivandrum,979,"1,962"

683, sriramaero , 17:33 ,BHPian,"Guys, I took Vitara Brezza for a test drive and I tested its offroad capability in one the difficult terrains. I really enjoyed the suspension, engine power, handling, dynamics, etc. I was pushing it to harder and harder terrain and at one point I know the I cannot go beyond a certain point and at that point I decided to turn back and return. However since the road was extremely narrow and I couldn't take a U-turn. This forced me to drive in the reverse gear for quite some distance. While I was going, with some difficulty I tackled some difficult terrains in the forward gear. However while I was coming back in the reverse gear, I got stuck in a place where I can't go reverse, nor front. Behind me was a big ditch and in-front of both my front tyres, were huge rocks where the Brezza got stuck. We were 4 in the car and tried to get the vehicle over the rock, but I am sure the vehicle didn't have enough torque/power to come over it. There was not much of a grip on the off-road as well with loose sand because of rain. Whenever I tried to get over the rock, the vehicle climbed a bit and then engine went off lacking power/torque. I know you all would say that the accelerator and clutch combination was not proper in my driving, But please trust me, I have driven vehicles in even worse terrains and I am pretty sure that I am not that bad in driving particularly off-roading. Then after putting some stones for the front tyres, and asking others to get down from the vehicle, I could manage to get over the rock and came back safely. I had the other option of asking 2 people to sit over the bonnet so that the front driving tyres would get more grip, However it was not necessary at that time. Now, at that time, I really felt that need of a 4WD, However I was happy that I could manage and tackle the issue somehow and got the vehicle over. Now I have 4 questions. 1) Does the vehicle have enough power to tackle difficult terrain? Has anyone else felt the same way that I have felt ? 2) Will there be a 4WD coming in Brezza?.. Is it really good to wait ? 3) I know there is no mention of a 4WD from Maruti till now, However, out of blue moon if they release one after say 6 months (Anyhow I have to wait for more than 6 months since there is a huge waiting period), Will it be possible for me to upgrade my booking later at that time, If I book a normal 2WD Zdi+ variant ? 4) After coming back, I noticed the tyres which were on the brezza were not meant for off-roading. Can anyone suggest me a good tyre for both Highways and Off-roading 5) Though I will not be doing extreme off-roading, I will be doing some amount of off-roading. In the past I have used Thar and Scorpio 4WD for off-roading. Do you guys think that Brezza can be used in comparison with those vehicles, Though I know that it cannot be on par, But at least to en extent ?

No news of an off-road version of Brezza with 4WD yet. But there are news about the international Vitara coming in AllGrip AWD avatar.

Did any other fellow TBHPians have this issue yet? Myself had the same issue Right side fog lamp cracked & I assumed that some biker would've hit it accidentally Again after a few days the left fog lamp also cracked Called Bimal Maruti service advisor He asked me to whatsapp the images After 2 days he called me to say that both would be covered under warranty & they replaced it The actual problem is that the fog lamp glass inferior quality or should I say they are not thick enough & it's damn cheap also each costing ₹812 The SA said even swift's fog lamps cost more than doubled that Cheap = poor quality I guess I guess replacing won't help until maruti improves the quality", 24th June 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Bangalore,393,196

Quote: Originally Posted by adimicra Does Brezza have any structural components or engineering which is better suited for off-road than say a Ecosport or Duster? No one has actually taken a Brezza off road with an Ecosport and compared the two, so we can't say for sure. But from my experience, European sedans and hatches like the Fiesta, Logan and the Punto have much more solid suspension than Japanese hatches. This is probably why the Brezza was derived by scaling down an SUV platform than scaling up a hatch. I can't imagine a Swift platform taking the same amount of abuse as a Punto, but the Vitara is known to be quite capable offroad, and is quite tough. So, why should we assume that the Brezza team took care to wring out every bit of SUV DNA out of the Vitara platform to make the Brezza? If they had intended to make a vehicle that only looked like an SUV, wouldn't it have made more sense to start off from a Swift platform? That would probably have been cheaper too. This is how every other soft-roader has been created, from a sedan/hatch platform. Regarding the Duster, it's an immensely capable vehicle, and I am in awe of how it looks and drives. I wish I could afford the Duster or the Terrano, as it's simply the best in the segment in terms of tackling bad roads, while remaining a good handler. The fact that it's based on the Logan platform is a credit to the ruggedness of the Logan, and a show of how good Renault's engineering is. I don't understand why people think I'm making the Brezza out to be some kind of HUMVEE, just because I said ""Brezza did feel competent and solid enough to handle the occasional light off road excursion"".

Yeti 4x4 is a capable soft-roader, so is the Duster AWD. (Indian version) Ecosport is just a raised hatchback with SUV-ish design elements. Russia I believe gets an AWD version, but we'll probably never see it here. I mentioned the Yeti only to clarify that multiple vehicle types can be based off of the same platform, but saying vehicle X shares a platform with vehicle Y so they must share similar characteristics is not necessarily true. Quite the opposite as is the case with the Skoda siblings, and a lot of others globally.

711, dZired , 14:46 ,Senior - BHPian,"Last month, Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza clocked 7193 unit sales, thus overtaking the Hyundai Creta which was leading the crossover segment till now. Maruti Suzuki has constantly been suffering to cope up with the huge demand that the Brezza has accumulated. With waiting periods rising to 8 months, the company has now decided to ramp up production of the Brezza to 10,000 units per month. This is not the first time that the automaker has revised production plans of the Brezza. After it received a favourable response at the 2016 Auto Expo, Maruti decided to enhance production plans of the Vitara Brezza to 100,000 units per annum, as compared to 80,000 units announced earlier. This clearly shows that the Brezza has surpassed expectations of Maruti Suzuki itself. The enhanced production run would begin from July. There are still around 52,000 orders pending for the Brezza, across the country. In addition to the Brezza, Maruti is also ramping up production of the Baleno premium hatchback, as it currently has a waiting period of around 4 months.

I don't know how else to make the 'platform' point, I'll try one last time anyway. A platform is just a base for a manufacturer to build vehicles on and depending on how modular-ly versatile the platform is designed to be, it can be used to build multiple vehicle types right from hatchbacks to full-blown SUVs. So when I evaluate a vehicle's capabilities, I don't make assumptions simply because the car in consideration shares a platform with another vehicle, as actual capabilities may vary. Personal opinion of course, you're as entitled to your own judgment as I am to mine. Quote: I don't really get what you mean by the ""built like a hatch"" part. Do you mean that it's a monocoque and not a body on frame SUV? Nothing to do with body-type. While body-on-frame construction is widely regarded as more robust and abuse-friendly, monocoque construction has its own advantages, preference depends entirely on user requirements. By 'built like a hatch', I just meant the car isn't built any different from a similarly-sized/specced hatchback (except the higher GC), and nothing in my recent detailed inspection and TD convinced me it's anything more than an equivalent hatchback. I actually found the Baleno better put together overall. Personal opinion again, your mileage may vary. Quote: That's not the point. Why choose to scale down a Vitara platform at all?

I definitely won't speculate on structural integrity/mechanical equivalence with global models. Sold-in-India models/variants aren't tested transparently (if at all) and there are plenty of examples of global models with compromised Indian versions. Given available trends, I'd be inclined to question quality until proven otherwise, rather than assume quality until proven wrong.

When you say that the Brezza is just another raised hatch, you are bunching it together with the crappy plastic clad fakes like the Cross polo, Etios cross, Fabia scout, i20 active etc, which are simply cosmetically different from the original hatches, without even raising the GC in most cases. The Brezza however, is a well engineered, genuine vehicle that was designed from the get go as a soft SUV. C V Raman's team has actually put together an all new vehicle as their entry in this segment, rather than simply slap a few black plastic bits and macho wheels on an existing, well selling hatch like the swift or Ritz and then call it a crossover or suv. This is a commendable job which deserves to be appreciated and not be simply put down and dismissed as ""raised hatchback"". Like you have said, the high ground clearance is a value add for any vehicle. Couple that with long travel suspension, high profile tyres, solid styling and being based on a good softroader platform, and you have a vehicle well suited to India. Sure, it doesn't have AWD now, as there's no real demand or need for it, but there's no reason it can't be offered later on, as the platform is capable of it.", 29th June 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Trivandrum,979,"1,962"

This was the bit of post by @sriramaero that I was responding to (post# 684, page 46): Quote: .....Do you guys think that Brezza can be used in comparison with those vehicles, Though I know that it cannot be on par, But at least to en extent?.... Here's my original post in response (post# 690, page 46): Quote: Brezza is ultimately a raised hatchback made to look like an SUV, not drive like one. Its similarities with the other vehicles you mentioned begins and ends with high GC. Even if there's an AWD version in the future, it would best be useful to tackle occasional tricky terrain, like most other soft-roaders. If you want a vehicle that can take regular offroad (ab)use in its stride, Brezza is not it. Note: The other vehicles he mentioned in his original post were a Thar and a Scorpio 4x4 with the express intent to compare off-roading capability. Read my post in context with the question it was in response to, not in isolation. Pretty Quote: ...not be simply put down and dismissed as ""raised hatchback"". I took the vehicle seriously enough to spend time evaluating it in detail to consider spending my hard-earned money on it. If you think that's dismissive and a put-down, I have nothing more to add.

It's a capable vehicle even in its current form - and I've said that all along - but like all its C-SUV counterparts in the market (one of which I'm seriously contemplating buying), it's all show and no go w.r.t. being an SUV. When the manufacturers give these cars equipment to match their 'apparent' capabilities, I'll re-evaluate the cars and my opinion. The current car doesn't cut it, for me. I see there's no point debating the 'platform' angle with you, so I'll let that be. All C-SUVs are raised hatches in my opinion, unless they come shod with equipment that gives them some actual SUV capabilities.

723, shankar.balan , 17:55 ,BANNED,"As a Yeti 4x4 owner, I would probably never take it seriously off the road. It is NOT, repeat NOT meant to do stuff like you can do in a Gypsy and a Thar and so on. Even if I visit the Hills and the Estate areas in it, the Yeti will still only take me on normal tarmac and of course, kutcha roads etc, to the local Golf Club and back or to my friends homes and back. Never into the seriously slushy mountain trails and so on. It is just basically too expensive a toy to take to such places. I would however, consider taking a Duster to some of these places, because its inherent GC is higher than the Yeti and it is a far cheaper vehicle. I mention also here, that the Yeti's Soft Roading/ Semi Off Roading/ 4x4 capability is best put to test in Icy or Snowy conditions which are commonly found in the Winter Thaw period in European countries or even perhaps in places like Kashmir or Leh/Ladakh or the Himalayan Mountains etc. To some extent, slush and muck and dust etc are fine, but for the most part, this vehicle was really designed for the conditions mentioned above. It does not inspire confidence in me (as a reasonably experienced real life utility based off road driver) to take it into the real deep slush and mud trails in the Monsoons in India or onto rocks or the desert where some pretty heavy articulation may be required. Like I said, I would never take my Yeti to the places where I used to take my Gypsy or the old Estate Mahindra MM540/550 or the CJ 500 which we had before that. No way. So I would urge those on this Forum, to consider seriously this whole concept of Off Roading. Just because the blessed vehicle is cosmetically enhanced to look like a tough off road going thing, doesn't mean it is capable of handling that. (It is like me in a fit of madness, wearing my Cowboy Boots and Stetson and carrying a Six-Gun, wandering into a Saloon perhaps in Waco, Texas in an aggressive manner and trying to pick a fight with some rough tough Harley Boys - I mean, the illustration here is basically a fight I can't darn well win, now can I? After all Im not John Wayne and real life is not a Western Movie, even though I can probably dress like him!) My old 4x2 Scorpio was nice and torquey and tough, but there were certain steep gradients and certain types of terrain that it simply could not handle. Same went for my old Bolero 4x2. Know your vehicle's limitations, your own skill limitations and know also what your main intent in buying the vehicle is. And then, study these limitations, use your god given brain/ head and sense of responsibility when you use the vehicle. Don't forget, break it all down to basics and think on it ; you're basically driving some welded metal bits propelled by a series of explosions within a confined chamber, driven by more bits of metal with some teeth in them and all of this supported by some bits of rubber which actually come into contact with the surface you are driving on. Have respect for these facts and this way you are less likely to go horribly irretrievably wrong! Quote: Originally Posted by Chetan_Rao Neither do I want to.

I mentioned the Yeti only to clarify that multiple vehicle types can be based off of the same platform, but saying vehicle X shares a platform with vehicle Y so they must share similar characteristics is not necessarily true. Quite the opposite as is the case with the Skoda siblings, and a lot of others globally.

The main intent of these pseudo-SUVs or raised hatchbacks is the raised ground clearance. I have just come back from a trip to Ooty/ Wayanad/ Gudaloor/ Bandipur and I felt the lack of ground clearance when driving on narrow mountain roads and kutcha roads. I went to all these places in an ultra low ground clearance Ford Figo that too at 62000 with a sagging front suspension in need of an overhaul. On the way to Avalanche near Ooty which is a kutcha road but without slush (the mud road is firm) , the car had countless underbody hits. A Nissan Terrano behind me had no problems because of ample ground clearance. In Wayanad's narrow rural mountain roads , there is enough road width for only 1 1/2 vehicle. The rains wash away the sand around the edges of the rod leaving deep craters. You have to make the car step down these craters if there is an oncoming vehicle. Again , I would be confident in a high GC vehicle. In any 2 WD vehicle driving on clayey slippery soil is risky. One Innova taxi tried parking inside a clayey slippery part of the parking lot and his vehicle ended up sliding sideways The Duster and the Yeti don't have much difference in terms of cost but its the fact that Yeti is quite delicate whereas the Duster is quite robust. I remember the Yeti having issues due to diesel quality and I would dread taking the Yeti anywhere outside the city. The Vitara Brezza is top on my list to upgrade to in a couple of years. The Creta is too expensive and I would rather get a XUV for that price. The Ecosport is a Ford and I am looking for something with peace of mind. With Ford, its not about service cost but it is a lack of quality control and reliability. Rusting doors, unpredictable timing belts etc. The Duster is simply too old and expensive and lacks features which leaves me only with the Brezza. At 10-11 lakhs OTR, its a great package- decent engine, good GC, good reliability, features (touch screen, rear view camera etc) , acceptable looks.

I remembered the Yeti being launched for 16.xx but the price has crept up by a whopping margin. Figo has rust issues especially in the coastal belt. Mine has rusted out in the points where the A and B pillars meet the doors and front fenders. Total of about 10 rust spots requiring tinkering and repainting of all 4 doors and both the fenders. That's quite an expense and an unexpected one at that. One rust spot developed into a hole in the door as well. I have now covered all the rust spots with M Seal to prevent further rusting.

730, vivekgk , 20:29 ,BHPian,"@ Chetan_Rao: Yes, the argument was getting rather pointless anyway. Truce, then? I might be in the minority here, but I've got to ask. Does anyone else think that Maruti styled the Brezza to look like a late 2000s design SUV? There doesn't seem to be any modern touches at all in the design. It's inoffensive and safe, like the Activa. It definitely has modern touches, like the LED lights and the projectors, but compared to what the current crop of modern cars like the Elite i20 offer in terms of styling, it's ages behind. The front blinkers look like they time traveled from 1990. The projector headlights look like an aftermarket fitment, owing to their shape and small size, and there's a distinct lack of flair in the design of the panels, quite unlike the Swift. Another interesting design choice is that the wheel arches, door panels and rear bumpers look like they've been lifted straight from the Yeti, and so do the interiors, in terms of design if not plastic quality. In fact, the touch screen looks completely out of place in the ZDi, and the regular 2-DIN unit in the lower variants looks it belongs there. The buttons and knobs on this unit perfectly complement the squircle console. The Brezza isn't a common sight on the roads now, but as deliveries begin in earnest and once all of these 70K+ vehicles are on the road, it looks like a design that will blend into the crowd too soon, especially in the single tone colors.

Our taxes contribute quite heavily to the exhorbitant prices of the Yeti here, and I'm guessing that European owners are probably a lot less concerned about getting the Yeti off-road. The Yeti in 2011 when I bought mine, was priced at about 27000 GBP or thereabouts for the same spec. That converted to INR 21.6 Lacs at the GBP conversion rate at that point which was 80 Rs. I was in England and was driving about in a Subaru Forester top spec which cost around 30K GBP at the time. That was when the famous Jeremy Clarkson review of the Yeti happened on Top Gear. That actually decided me and I bought the Yeti Elegance 4x4 that same year. The On road price was about 22 lacs or so as I ve said. I got it for 19-19.5. A year later I was on holiday in Australia and the Yeti was launched there too at a price of about 42000 AUD. At the then conversion rate of Rs 55 per AUD, it worked out to about 23 lacs. Now the point I am making is that the India pricing for the same spec of Yeti was eminently fair in my opinion, notwithstanding the import duties and taxes and all the rest of it. It was actually comparable to the AUD or GBP prices. This was one reason I just went for it because I have never seen any other ""Imported Car"" coming to India at an On Road Price at anywhere nearabouts its International ""Drive Away"" price. Especially here in Bangalore where the road taxes are the highest. To me, the Yeti was really a no brainer of a decision, I just loved it so much for what it is!

You are right - the Brezza is a sub 4m vehicle which doesn't make it ""really big"" as you claim. A sub 4m is primarily close to the size of a B-segment hatchback and that's exactly how the Brezza feels visually (in terms of size). The styling is neutral again and road presence is nothing great. Finally, you made a choice of a vehicle. Please be happy with the virtues you believe the vehicle has.

Thanks a lot for your detailed explanation dude. However, in my perspective, If I am looking for a compact SUV (in this case, Its Brezza), I would basically compare it with its competitors like Ecosport, Avventura, i20 Active. I would never compare it with a ""different segment car with an 800cc engine"" whether its styling & presence is great or not. I understand that you are giving your feedback from a neutral and un-biased perspective by comparing these two cars from two different segments to help prospective buyers in making their decisions. However, Its difficult for me to accept that people who think about a compact SUV segment car would look at the styling & presence of a completely different segment car for comparison, be it a small hatch back or a luxury hatch back or even a sedan.

This trick is implemented by dealers to take benefit of the long waiting list, and earn additional benefits while forcing you to take the accessories. Maruti is strictly against such policies. Back in 2012 when the Swift had a long waiting period, the dealer was forcing my colleague to buy a ZDi with useless accessories worth 60k thrown in. That was the only way of getting faster delivery. We asked for written document stating that this is the manufacturer's policy-they declined it. We then recorded the conversation, mailed it to MSIL, and even if we were supposed to wait for some months, Maruti ensured that the dealer gave us that car-without any unwanted accessories. We were told that the dealership was even penalised by MSIL. So never fall for such malpractices. Today, its a buyer's market and is no longer the monopoly of a brand or a dealer.

Loss of control over wer roads is generally due to hydroplaning or aquaplaning. This is a risky situation. Wikipedia explains the hydroplaning as follows: Aquaplaning or hydroplaning by the tires of a road vehicle, aircraft or other wheeled vehicle occurs when a layer of water builds between the wheels of the vehicle and the road surface, leading to a loss of traction that prevents the vehicle from responding to control inputs. If it occurs to all wheels simultaneously, the vehicle becomes, in effect, an uncontrolled sled. New tyres of your car shall not aquaplane at 80-90 kmph. Maybe, it was just a temporary loss of traction due to wet surface. There is enough information on the forum about this. You can go through a similar experience of another member at same speed: http://www.team-bhp.com/forum/owning...ml#post1371771", 18th July 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Pune,"1,155","1,956"

Yes, it is definitely spacious than Swift, rear leg room is much better and due to taller sitting position, the front seats would settle at relatively forward position.

If the car is going to be used mostly inside the city and you don't have to encounter bad roads and tight parking spots frequently, I would suggest to have a look at Ciaz as well.

Though they are improving, they have a long way to go. They really need to make sure that their 10L+ offering doesn't start rattling only after 1500 odd kms. And that steering and those power window switches also don't belong there. Other small yet irritating things:Can hear AC compressor getting on/off inside the cabin. Can hear the sound of Central locking system's motor when it unlocks all the doors. Mood lights look very cheap during day time due to poor brightness (even if brightness is set to max) Seat belt reminder doesn't turn off automatically at low speeds, not even if the car is running in the reverse gear.

835, Paradox , 23:54 ,BHPian,"Initial Observations: - I feel that the metal sheet used for overall build is very light. Eg., The doors feel very light, while opening or closing from the outside. However, Maruti did a trick of moving the door handle deep inside, so it gives an impression of a heavy door, while you lock it from inside. (Simple Physics) - Cabin has better isolation from outside, but one could hear the Diesel Engine noise until it crosses 2000 RPM. (I upgraded from Petrol car, so maybe its just me :P) - Never used the dead pedal before and having one in Brezza slightly annoys me. Sure I'll get adjusted to that. - No leather-wrap on the steering wheel yet. Need to get one this weekend. - Awesome view from the driver seat! - Navigation Map is a huge let down. I'd prefer google maps anytime. - Ride quality is better with 4 people in the car, but feels slightly sturdy when alone. - Still trying to figure out Auto Wiper / Auto Headlamps", 9th August 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Bengaluru,55,11

I usually keep the sensitivity set on 2nd lowest setting. I understand that it will wipe only if there are rain drops around the sensor but somehow it fails to do the first wipe automatically on let's say 9 out of 10 occasions. That's very poor success rate. On the contrary, I have never experienced failure in the first wipe from her German garage mate, Jetta, even when the sensitivity is set to the lowest. One more thing I want to add is, Brezza wipes faster than Jetta with the same sensitivity settings once it goes going, so overall sensitivity is set higher by germans is also not the case here. What I feel is auto wiper is engineered a little poorly and the first wipe doesn't trigger on most the occasions. I will give setting the sensitivity to the highest level a try but again, it's more work than a manual wipe to change sensitivity before and after you start the car.", 11th August 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Pune/Ahmedabad,365,483

It was performing very nicely in the highways as well as in hair-pin curves of the hilly section. Got a chance to drive through a sticky mud terrain of almost 250 metres. The stretch had rubbles and puddles with curves and slopes. I could feel the tires loosing the grip and getting skid, but managed to get out of it by maintaining a constant speed throughout in the first gear. Had it been with my earlier car, I would not have dared to attempt this. Got mileage of 19.3 in highways and 18.6 in highways + hilly terrain. Content about the overall performance during the trip of around 1400 kms, of highways & ghat sections, in rain and sun. But in Bangalore city, I am still getting 16.5, which is not bad. The problems I encountered till now are two; no rattles yet though. Once both the front fog lamps had to be changed, the updates which I have posted earlier in this thread. One developed a crack and the other lamp's front cover was broken off completely. Dealership changed it and understood that it is wide-spread issue with Brezza. Secondly, I had my rear seat stitching snapped in a corner where we sit. I had to take it to the dealership. It took half a day for them to stitch it back.

The technology is designed to activate the wipers during a crash and thus helping the driver and the passenger to see outside the car by clearing the windshield from dust/water/mud/ whatever slush. So I assume the force in which your vehicle goes through the pot hole is creating an alert system and is clearing the windshield.

Yes, in actual crash the wiper goes on and the senitivity for wiper and airbag activation are different. What I meant is that in your scenario, after the initial jerk there is no further input for the system to recognize it as a crash. For e.x. After locking your car, try kicking the tyres a bit harder. The Autocop system senses some vibration adn the blinkers blinks once, then since the input is not sufficient enough to declare as a theft it stops.

Dealer: Kiran Motors, Ahmedabad Following are the points I asked MASS to sort out. The development on the last one is very interesting. Irritating momentary noise from the driver door, one second after the driver window is completely rolled up. -> Turns out it is because of the (cheap) equipment MSIL has used to achieve anti pinch feature. SE showed me the same in TD vehicle and it was way more prominent in that vehicle. I guess my brezza would reach there soon Does anyone else face the same issue? (The same can be replicated by holding driver power windows button upward for a second and then releasing, even if the window is completely rooled). Final outcome: Will have to live with it. Annoying noise (chi-chi) from break pedal while applying breaks. -> MASS didn't bother to resolve it. Final outcome: SE spoke to technical adviser, he inquired further about the issue and turns out a few other customers faced the same issue as well. They were confident that it can be resolved by replacing break switch. Both guys visited me at my office, replace the switch and the issue is resolved now. Rattle from Odometer panel and the panel on the right side of it hosting an ac went on rough roads and during turbo lag vibrations -> MASS didn't bother to resolve it. Final Outcome: Will have to visit the service station again, they promised to resolve. Rattle originating from bottom of the driver seat on rough roads. (The same can be replicated by jumping a little on driver's seat when the car is stationary) -> MASS didn't bother to resolve it. Final Outcome: Will have to visit the service station again, they promised to resolve. Here comes the most interesting issue. I have posted it in the thread a few days back as well. The wiper does a single wipe in auto mode when the car hits a pothole. -> SE said they opened the re-fitted the sensor to resolve the issue but it wasn't resolved. Final Outcome: When SE and technical adviser came to replace the break switch, I demoed the issue to adviser as well. He said he would update me regarding the same in a day. I wasn't contacted by MASS in the next 24 hours so I contacted SE. He said that he, technical adviser, workshop manager and TSM(Not sure what it stands for, he said TSM is appointed by MSIL at dealership level) tested TD car and couple of other customers' cars and the issue exists in them as well!! They have written an email to MSIL and waiting for there response, they are confident that it is a mass(common) issue and MSIL would recall brezza(zdi+) to fix the issue. He also showed me that the issue can be replicated by simply hitting a nail on the rain sensor housing inside the cabin. It was very shocking! Does any of you guys face the same issue? The simplest way to check is hit the sensor housing with nail (similar to how we hit carom striker) My car is from the early batch (got delivery in April, haven't bothered to check Mfg date as it was announced only a month back when I purchase). Brezza surely has got fair share of niggles. MASS is also not living up to the expectations as well. Other Info regarding the service: Service cost: 0rs. Asked SE to check availability of auto dimming IRVM when I dropped the car. Never heard back from him regarding the same. Asked him to get music settings reset, didn't do it as well. So, it would be great if someone can tell me default Bass and treble level in zdi+ HU. I played with the settings and now the sound comes really unimpressive.

I had filled a tankful of diesel upon getting delivery, and filled again today. Saw an astonishing average of 25 kmpl by the tank-to-tank method - for my daily 12+12 km commute to office. I do come in and go early, before the rush hour - but this is great economy for a city runabout. So this kind of average is possible with steady driving. The MID shows an average of 20.4 - so the real figure seems to be much higher. Overall I have had a trouble free experience first month. I have switched from a low slung Fiat Palio MJD - so it took me some time to adjust to this new higher driving position. Also the suspension is quite firm, and with the larger wheel diameter, it does track all undulations on the road at low speeds, especially when you are driving alone. With a full 4 passenger load and higher speeds the suspension feels very stable and well damped. The steering though cannot be compared to a Fiat, but is alright and one feels in control at all times. I do not find that the low-end-torque is a big issue in the Brezza, it can happily pull along in 3rd gear in most city conditions.

Have been busy recently 5000 Kms 2nd Service Update - this was done on 9-Sep'16 In just about a little over 3 Months, my Brezza ZDI+ (Red + Black Top) touched the 5000 Kms mark. Time for the 2nd Free service. I had a few niggles here and there; but as I mentioned earlier, that this for me was a True Upgrade from my 2008 Alto LXi and I extremely am pleased with my purchase. Niggles Namely - 1. Brake pedal making sound (cheek- cheek type). No effect on the braking of the vehicle though. 2. Left ORVM was slower than the Right ORVM. 3. Heavy Rains resulted the left Wiper to be little off its alignment. Not sure if any one faced issues with wipers. 4. The center console had developed a gap, needed refitting. 5. AC when switched on, momentarily gave foul smell. This was due to the dirt and muck getting stuck in the heavy rains. 6. Rattles in the dashboard and Right side Window Glass 7. Touch Screen Entertainment unit needs update. All the issues were addressed pretty well. The Break pedal noise (as suggested by fellow BHPians in the forum) is related to a switch that was replaced. Music System upgrade is pending. Reached the service center at 8:00 am in the morning. Requested if I can get the car in 2-3 hours; but due to shortage of Mechanics (On going Ganpati festival), I was given a time of 4:00 pm. Usually Andheri Sai Service sees a lot of rush and the time was ok with me. Car was spic-n-span when received. My views, fantastic car to be in. Still find a lot of people staring when I pass through. Looks of the dual tone is miles ahead.Great Road Presence, good driveability, steering feedback is good, ride is pliant, seats 5 very comfortably and excellent mileage. At present the MID shows 18.1 kmpl and my calculations on a full tank method are 17.8 kmpl. This is daily office drive which involves 4 Kms on a highway. When I took it to Goa from Mumbai it gave me around 18.5 kmpl overall; but then the engine was pretty new. (Yes.. I took care that till 1000 Kms I do not exceed 2000rpm and till 3000 Kms 2300 rpm was max). Once close to the 5000 Km mark, I wanted to just stretch her legs on an empty highway stretch. She pulled effortlessly till 120 Kmph. I held this speed for about a minute or so; and Brezza was flat and poised. Slowed down to 80 post that and continued. Another addition to all the positives mentioned in the forum about Brezza is the visibility while driving in the Rains. This season it has just poured in Mumbai and with great tyres, high seating it is really easy to maneover the vehicle. Also thick tyres ensure that potholes are less interruptive than earlier. Though the tyres had their share of punctures; 2 nails at once. This was around the 4K mark. One thing that I noticed; the spare is a steel rim (which we all know). But it has a round yellow sticker pasted to it stating ""do not Exceed 120 Km/h"". @BoneCollector - I too have faced the same issue of condensation on Headlamps. But mine is on the inside (towards the 'S' badge) Few parting pics with some cars it is compared with. ", 22nd September 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Mumbai,37,59

Small price to pay for safety and longitivtiy of the tyre's cause replacement is expensive.

On contrary, I have never experienced auto sweep after hitting a pothole on my MK6 Jetta. This might be related to the the fact I usually break harder when I see a pothole while driving Jetta. But again, my sight have missed pothole on quite a few occasions while driving Jetta and she has hit them at higher speeds on multiple occasions. Regarding Brezza, I feel things are getting worse every day. The swipe was triggered couple of times after driving over a speed-breaker at approx 20kmph . I strictly keep wipers 'Off' and switch to 'Auto' whenever it rains and then back to 'Off' again. Also no update from MASS regarding the issue, I followed up SA twice, I got the same answer ""We have forwarded the issue to TSM"" and he wasn't able to specify any timeline for the resolution.

Speaking of niggles, a new noise is generated from below of the right most AC vent whenever the car goes over bad roads. The same thing I experienced with my first gen Dzire after 67k Kms, didn't get a chance to sort it out before selling her. I spoke to SA regarding it, they kept the car for 6 hours and told me that it is caused by AC grill and it is 'common', I shouldn't be 'bothered' by it. The noise was gone after they removed the grill. I was in real hurry when the car was delivered to me so didn't argue with him.

Well, the bill came up to 3700/ rs including the wheel balancing and rotation. The car was feeling a little sluggish before the service and it was evident that it needed some pampering.

943, drnilswap , 23:40 ,BHPian,"Just did a crude 15 minute photoshop job on the Brezza for my visualization purpose. I thought of sharing it here. Might be useful for those Brezza owners who are thinking of getting dual tone look for their car. These are not very high resolution pics. I took the screenshots of the car from the official Maruti website so as to get all three colors in exact same proportion, angle and texture. This enabled me to just cut the roof from one car and paste over other without worrying about anything else. Also, given my not so great photoshop skills there was no other way. [ Background: I booked Brezza ZDI (red) in the month of March after cancelling Baleno Alpha (petrol) (that was almost ready to be delivered) even though I was not fully convinced about buying a diesel given my low usage of personal vehicle. Thrice Ive postponed the delivery of my Brezza since then as I was away in South Korea for last six months for my fellowship. In the mean time, having stretched the budget from Baleno to Brezza, I started appreciating the S Cross more. And Im sold over the new facelift. Also the possibility of that boosterjet engine in Brezza/S Cross has just added to the confusion. After having waited for eight odd months Im not sure if I should wait more. So, if I find my way out of this confusion and get my Brezza (red), I would be going for the white roof A-La-Evoque. Or might do the same with the S Cross. ] PS: Im not fully convinced about the idea of having a black car roof. Even though it looks very cool, actually, it is not. As black objects have lesser albedo than whites, they absorb more radiation meaning higher temperatures inside the car leading to more work for AC. Also, since red Brezzas with black roof would be very common.

Hope you guys find it useful.)", 19th October 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Nagpur,49,120

Good shot drnilswap at visual enhancement, and what I particularly liked about this attempt is that it not contemporary.

It looks smart and totally different, especially with those optional Rims. Any which way you look at it, S-cross is a superior product compared to both Brezza & Baleno.

955, BoneCollector , 13:47 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"The Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza was launched in March 2016 http://www.team-bhp.com/forum/offici...al-review.html and has taken the market by storm, so much so that it commands a huge waiting period. The car is superb in all aspects, basically Jack of all, Master of none! My Brezza came in early May and I've been having a good time with it. But like all fairy tales, this one also has its shares of monsters. There are a few nagging niggles being reported on the Vitara Brezza Owners Club on Facebook, Link https://www.facebook.com/groups/VBOClub/ as well as being faced by me. The purpose of this thread is to report all niggles being faced by the owners as well as the possible solutions if they have come across or been offered (part replacement). 1. The most prominent issue being faced by many including me is the building up of condensation inside the headlight unit. The condensation occurs after the vehicle has run for some 50 odd kms or more and slowly goes off when vehicle is switched off. The condensation is independent of the headlamps being switched on or not. Its more if humidity is more, but is present even in dry weather. During rains or high humidity period, the condensation is so pronounced that the light scatters. This matter has been reported to the various service centers across the country and some even got replacements, but those also developed the same issue. Moreover, the condenstaion is not limited to only ZDi/Zdi+ with projectors but also LDi and VDis. I've posted a link here. https://www.facebook.com/groups/VBOC...77613646038283 2. Second issue being face by the owners is cracking of fog lamps. Multiple owners have reported it but I'm posting snaps of one owner from the Facebook page (Mr Vishal Iyer). I've not suffered this issue as yet. 3. Another issue is squeaking of windows especially when they are being closed. This is more prominent in driver's side and little less on passenger side in my car. I request the owners of Brezza to kindly share their niggles here and also post if they have come across a solution to it. N.B. I've not included ""rattles"" as a niggle as I find them inherent to Maruti vehicles as well as others also.

Quoting a few owners to respond, I have following to add from my 7K KM and 6 months of ownership. 1. Condensation issue :- i have not noticed regularly but once after car wash i did see some mist inside the headlight which vanished after few hours. 2. Cracking of fog lamps :- I have not faced this issue. All intact till now. 3. squeaking of windows :- Yes this is correct, it is like as if the motor is more powerful than the one required for the widow pane. I mean the speed of window going up has increased ( if i compare with my old RITZ) which may imply(maybe my wishful thinking) that the motor is more powerful but once the glass touches the top it does not fit it softly but gives a squeak as if it is hitting hard. To feel it more prominently you can just pull the switch up with even when the glass is rolled up and can hear the squeak sound. Apart from this not much niggles till now.

We politely asked to cut our test drive short and drove straight to the Hyundai showroom and booked the Creta. Maruti sales kept reminding us about the 6 month waiting list. My response was simple - if the herd runs and falls into a well, would you follow? Firstly, let me just start off by saying I'm not here to gloat or diss on the Brezza, but it was the same situation for me as well. I was seriously considering the Brezza, and was sold on it at one point, but the long waiting period gave me time to re-evaluate. Overall, I feel that the Brezza focuses more on the looks than substance. The powertrain is now just about adequate. The creature comforts, especially on the lower variants, are seriously lacking. I think that the Creta is a much better vehicle if you can afford it, and if you can't, (like me), the Ecosport is a much better choice overall. Of course, nothing comes close to Maruti on service availability and resale value, but then, you win some, you lose some. Personally, I like the overall looks of the Brezza a bit more than the Ecosport, as it looks more classically SUV-handsome, with the wide stance, squared off wheel arches and larger tyres reminding me of the old behemoths like the 90s Pajero and Prado. But then, it looks dated compared to the original Vitara, and even compared to the much older Ecosport. Having owned the Ecosport for more than 4 months and 4000 kms now, I think that only bad thing that I've had to deal with with Ford is the service. It has not been pleasant, even with just the one 2500km service under my belt. Here's why I chose the Ecosport TDCi Titanium over the Brezza ZDi: 1) Driving Experience: The 1.5L diesel mill in the Ecosport makes more power and torque than the Multijet. I feel that it has better response, better low end torque, and more refinement. The extra 250cc does make a difference. The steering feel and response as well as handling is also better. I think that the Brezza had better ride quality though. 2) Equipment: At the same price point, the Ecosport had a much better sounding audio system, and more features, like the Smartkey, adjustable lumbar support, reclining rear seats, leather covered bits, cooled glove box and an alloy spare. With the Brezza, only the ZDi and above were reasonably well specced. And even then, too many of the goodies were restricted to the ZDi+ variant. 3) Discounts: Ford dealers were competing with each other to get the customer, and it was a buyer's market. Not so the case with the Brezza. With such a long waiting period, you took what you were offered. Not even the basic kit was free, and they were insisting on even the insurance being taken from the dealer itself. Even with the Ecosport having got a price cut only a few months before, the dealers were willing to cut deals. Still, the number one question I am asked regarding my new car is: ""Why didn't you buy the Brezza?"", which kind of sums up the kind of faith and value that the Maruti Suzuki brand inspires. The second reaction is, ""Is that all the space there is?"", after the have a look inside. The Brezza wins in terms of interior space and sheer bling factor. There is more room everywhere, front, back, boot, you name it. With the customization packs now on offer and the funky colors you can get one in, the Brezza is definitely the more youthful looking of the two, especially in the dual tone variants.", 5th November 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Trivandrum,979,"1,962"

A very fair assessment. I am a Brezza ZDi+ owner and a big time Maruti fan in terms of reliability. I did consider other options before buying the Brezza including Creta and Ecosport. However, went with my personal choice which was based on reliability for city and occasional long distance, tested engine with great mileage and service. Of course, looks of Brezza are hard to ignore. I do however agree that I didn't get any discount and had to wait 3.5 months as against indicated waiting of 6-7 months. Creta doesn't seem to be a choice as with the price tag of Creta you may as well consider a XUV (W6)!!! Ecosport is great with the features tightly highlighted but I don't quite like its front profile and poor after sales service. I would prefer Brezza's front profile with Ecosport's rear profile Be that as it may, Brezza is a jack of all trades and master of some but indeed a value for money car and therefore, agree with Bhavik1991.

Thank you. But reiterating that it all depends on personal choices, I didn't buy Brezza for off-roading abilities. I believe it doesn't boast of it as well. No one who is into hardcore off-roading would consider this compact SUV, rather would go with Thar, Gypsy or the like. But reviews available in public domain reveal that with 198 mm GC it is capable of handling difficult terrain where many of the cars would give up. I personally don't like Sedans. I had other factors also under consideration like - drive ability in city, better and higher seating position, better visibility, decent space, good looks, etc. Hence, settled down with Brezza which may not excel in all fronts (which I believe no car does) but it would not disappoint one on most of the fronts and is a true value for money car. I know that merely the mass is jumping into the well, there is no reason to follow the herd. But at the same time, the sale figures of Brezza says it all. It is hard to believe that all of them are wrong in their choices. Frankly, the sale figures of Ciaz and the number of them on the roads did not inspire much confidence in me. I read, Brezza was the best selling car in the last few months and continues to be in the top selling cars until Innova Crysta crossed the figures (which again is a different category). So let's not complicate the thread meant for Brezza and respect personal choices and enjoy our respective cars and not criticise.", 6th November 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Gurgaon,287,541

The Brezza is inferior option to its own stable mate, the Ciaz, which I also own and offers all the pluses you've mentioned about the Brezza (reliability, great mileage, service etc.) I suppose that's the entire basis for my argument here - I couldn't believe how built to a price Maruti's ""SUV"" felt to drive and sit in and can't see why anyone would buy a Brezza over a Ciaz other than the willingness to sacrifice quality, luxury and comfort for looks and the image of off road capability (without any actual ability). I've been asked the same question by many folks. When I say my car cost more than 10 lakhs, many respond with ""You could have bought a Honda City"". I think that it's just the herd mindset that 'length of car is directly proportional to social status/luxury'. For the same money, I had the option of Ciaz VDi+ or ZDi at a bit of a stretch. While I loved the SHVS system (I switch off the engine at traffic stops) and the overall looks, I wanted the high seating position offered by the CUVs. It is a definite advantage in traffic, and greatly reduces fatigue during night drives. It also aids your ability to judge the oncoming traffic better and thus help plan your moves better. The shorter length of the CUVs is also a definite plus in the city and while parking. There's also the better level of equipment that most CUVs come with, at the same price point. A sedan that's as well equipped as the Brezza ZDi+ or the Ecosport Titanium+ would cost close to a lakh more, AFAIK. Another factor that definitely influenced my choice for a CUV (though it should not have) is the fact that every one of my neighbours had either a sedan or a compact sedan, including the Etios, Dzire, Ciaz, City and the Vento. My previous car was an Indigo CS. I think that several CUV buyers like me, make their decision as they want something different from the crowd. With the way the Brezza bookings are going and looking at the large number of Brezzas already on the road, it seems as if the 'crowd' itself is now changing.

Sadly, it will be a while for the sedans to recover barring the Ciaz which sells because of the brand. I think that there's still a market for sedans, as they are generally more sporty and more comfortable. None of the CUVs can offer a ride that's comparable to a sedan. They lose out on handling as well, with the body roll that's a function of the ride height. The Ciaz, City, Verna and the Vento all have wider rear seats, larger boots, and more room than the CUVs. Really, it's the Compact sedans and premium hatchbacks that are taking the hit, IMO. The top end variants of the CSedans are priced just about the same as the CUVs, and since most CSedans don't have that much rear room or boot space, CUV buyers don't feel they lose out much. Premium hatches are feeling the heat though, and the proof is the i20 Active, Urban Cross, Avventura, CrossPolo, Etios Cross etc. I think that the Unchi has been the new Lambi since the launch of the Duster. We all remember when the Duster had long waiting periods, and the frenzy during the launch of the Ecosport. India has been SUV country since politicos and film stars moved from Mercs to LandCruisers and Pajeros. It's just that they didn't get affordable to own, run and maintain till the advent of the Duster, with it's alluring combo of good FE and SUV charm. Every CUV that followed, from the Ecosport to the Creta, got an overwhelming response. Except for the S-Cross, which as a crossover, was simply confused and confusing. What MSIL did with the Brezza was to offer the perfect solution to the Car=Maruti crowd who had been eyeing these CUVs with fascination, but were reluctant to leave the reassuring cover of the MSIL umbrella. Here's a real SUV-looking car, with proven Maruti powertrains, backed by Maruti service, quality, brand value, resale expectations and more. It was so potent a threat that Ford did the unthinkable and rushed to undercut the Brezza in price with their Ecosport, a product that is priced over the Duster in every other market. Tata is (as usual) late to the party and hopefully, they're studying the menu. Mahindra has offered a wide array of half-baked solutions with typically (for M&M) polarizing styling cues. We have the Brezza to thank for really shaking up the CUV segment and putting the other manufacturers on their toes. Thanks to the Brezza feeding frenzy, we got the updated 100PS Ecosport, the 100PS TUV and the Nuvosport. I've no doubt Tata's Nexon will try and one-up the Brezza in terms of equipment and pricing.", 7th November 2016,maruti-vitara-brezza,Trivandrum,979,"1,962"

Maruti Suzuki in their press release have mentioned that they sold 17.2k units in the UV segment(Brezza, S Cross, Ertiga and Gypsy) And if the Brezza has sold less than Tiago, ie less than 6k units, that means Ertiga, S Cross and Gypsy have sold around 11k units, which can't be the case. Ertiga can't cross more than 6k again, else it would have been above the Tiago. And its highly unlikely that either the S-Cross or the Gypsy has done 5k units.

I have noticed your opinion on Brezza has been steadily declining Would you suggest me reconsider? I am sure you must have put a lot of thoughts before finalizing Brezza just like me. In my case, it was a very close call between Brezza, S-Cross, EcoSport & pre-owned S-Cross 1.6, XUV 5OO. I was leaning towards pre-owned options but unfortunately couldn't find a good one, so had to pick one from the new ones. After 2nd service at 5k kms, I started wondering whether I made a right choice whenever I spot a EcoSport or S-Cross and unfortunately, I never get a definite 'yes' in the answer (hence the thoughts of selling). Apart from mentioned pros and cons in official review, I would highlight a few points which unfortunately, I was unaware about at the time of purchase. Fortunately, you have the luxury of taking these points into account while making the decision. Can be resolved but hasn't been by sub-par MASSAuto-wiper is unnecessarily triggered when the car goes over a speed breaker or even a small pothole. Navigation is not working in HU. A prominent squeak is generated from the driver seat when the car goes over the speed breaker/ bad roads which causes the driver to have a little 'fall' on the seat. LHS headlight's low beam covers more area(reaches distance) than RHS headlight's low beam. Rattles from window glasses Rattles from parcel tray Rattles from door panels. Rattles from dashboard More rattles from the dashboard. PS: I have dropped the car at the workshop on 3 occasions for the entire day but they absolutely did nothing about the issues. MASS is a huge let down here in Ahmedabad. From my personal experience, VW after sales is miles ahead. Instead of resolving issues, MASS keep finding innovative ways of looting customers. I have escalated the issues to workshop manager as well but all in vein. Hasn't been brought to the attention to MASS yetClutch is getting hard everyday. For comparison, it is harderd than 67k clocked first gen Swift Dzire Vdi's clutch. Will post an update regarding the same by end of this week after the 10K kms service. Resolved by MassGearbox wasn't smooth at all. Resolved by replacing bushing. Though, still have the trouble in engaging reverse gear sometimes. MASS says it's a typical Maruti thing and I will have to leave with it. Squeaks when the break pedal is pressed. Replaced by replacing the break switch. Smaller yet irritating things which cannot be fixed (at least at free of cost)Unfortunately, the car is not well built. Materials used for interior is a big let down. It just doesn't feel like a million rupees car. When you enter the car, the cabin feels pleasant than 1st gen Swift Dzire (my previous Maruti) however as soon as the car starts moving, you feel 'downgraded'. I, for one, cannot tolerate numerous rattle in a million rupees car in the first year of ownership (The first rattle was experienced around just 2000 kms). A prominent squeak is generated from door panel (may be due to power window motor) after 1-2 seconds of driver's window glass finishes rolling up. Mood lights looks very cheap during daytime due to their low brightness (even at max level). HU is not smart at all when compared with my Jetta's RCD 510. It doesn't remember I muted music before I switched off the car. It will start playing music as soon as I come back. It doesn't remember I have paused music on my smartphone connected via bluetooth. If somehow my smartphone is disconnected, it will start playing FM on higher volume. It doesn't have an option to lower music volume whenever reverse gear is engaged. The seatbelt reminder isn't smart either unlike Jetta. It won't shut even if the car's speed comes below 10-20kmph or reverse gear is engaged. Unfortunately, reminder sound masks reverse parking sensor's sound very well. Restarting the car is the only option to shut the reminder warning. Automatic ORVM folds a little bit slower (almost takes 2x times compared to Jetta). You can't go pass the incoming vehicle without stopping your car on narrow streets, in case you need to fold ORVMs. They will take their time to fold. Things that I like about the car and learnt about during the ownership.The ability to talk to your phone's voice assistant (Google now[my case], Siri, Google Assistant) via car's mic using steering mounted control. You can conveniently make a call, text, whatsapp, set reminder/alarms without taking your hands off the steering wheel. Steering mounted control works even when the ignition is in 'off' position (single press of Start button without engaging clutch, the car is off but HU remains ON) unlike Jetta. HU stays on for 1-2 seconds after you stop the car, so it won't restart if you want to keep ignition in 'off' position (single press of Start button without engaging clutch, the car is off but HU remains ON). Very handy if you want to stay inside the car until you finish your ongoing call via bluetooth. Ergonomics are spot on and there is ample of space inside cabin for a sub-4m car. I am 6'1"" and it is hard to believe that a passenger behind me can also sit comfortably in a sub-4m car. I like to drive in very relaxed sitting position (i.e low seating & far from dashboard). For comparison, I need to adjust my driving position a little bit in my MK6 Jetta in order to fit a passenger behind my seat which is not the case with Brezza Also keep in mind that some of the mentioned issue might be specific to my car and some can be resolved by competent after sales service. One more thing, I would like to add that is I was under the impression is 1.3 MJD is a proven workhorse and there has been absolutely no issue in clocking 1L+ kms for most the previous owners. But then I came across this thread a couple of days back. http://www.team-bhp.com/forum/techni...0-000-kms.html 1.3MJD with 90hp tuning doesn't play as nice as 75hp tuning in long run (one more reason that provoked the thoughts of selling) Take your time, contemplate your choice. Brezza ticks most of the boxes for the mass market however I believe a million rupees car shouldn't be just that. If it meets your requirements better than any other car & you are willing to compromise on these little things, then go for it. PM me if you have any query, would be glad to help.

1067, BoneCollector , 14:56 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"I was wondering as to how MSIL is planning to price the Brezza Boosterjet if it is launched. If we look at the Baleno RS, its priced 1.4L over the regular Petrol Alpha and even nearly 30K more than the Diesel Alpha with a 75BHP heart! In case of Brezza which has a 89BHP heart, since we have no petrol variant, we have to compare it with the Top End Diesel, ZDi+. Now if we consider a more powerful engined Brezza and 75BHP Baleno, the price difference between a Boosterjet Brezza and DDiS Brezza might not be that much and could be near similar if MSIL is not greedy. However, having Diesel variants cheaper than Petrol variants may have some implications on its sale. Ecosport has a 1.5L NA variant which does the duty without any complaints. I hope MSIL also comes up with a 1.4/1.5L NA Petrol engined Brezza as well as a Boosterjet one. In that case, the Ecosport Ecoboost Titanium + would be a better option in my opinion when compared to Brezza Boosterjet.", 4th March 2017,maruti-vitara-brezza,BIHAR,"3,194","10,794"

Both would enjoy the same excise benefits but Maruti might need to spend more as the boosterjet is imported. The low hp in diesel will be compensated well by the additional torque in the diesel. Just note how the Baleno petrol and diesel are equally fast/slow from 0-100 and similar. So the boosterjet will not provide any significant performance gains and lag will be more evident in the Brezza due to the higher weight compared to the Baleno. IMO it does not make sense to launch the boosterjet at the same price as diesel as its a no-brainer to pick the diesel over the boosterjet. See how well the Ecosport diesel sells compared to the ecoboost which are priced within 40k of each other. Unless Maruti localizes this engine and is able to price about 50-70k lower than the diesel in the Brezza, it does not make sense and if Maruti decides to give Breeza the Ecoboost, they should give S-Cross the same as well as they both weigh the same. Another reason for Maruti to price the boosterjet Baleno so high is to to target impatient Baleno customers and make a killing on the margin as Boosterjet waiting period will be lower than the Baleno Alpha.

MS has sold more than 1 lakh Brezza just with diesel engines. They can surely look to double the number in the next year with petrol engines as there are many Ford Ecosport buyers who are petrol-heads and the absence of a petrol in Brezza is a deal breaker.

Frequent pairing/unpairing is -in my experience - an issue with the handset. - unpair your handset and in fact, unpair all handsets if any. Turn off the BT of all your handsets in the vicinity. - grab another handset of different model/make, with a different version of OS if it is Android, and pair it with your car. Now test and find out it is working OK. - confirm your results by repeating the process and pairing a THIRD handset. If all the three handsets are working erratically, contact your Brezza dealer. You might want to give your head unit a reset before that. Read your ICE manual, or unplug the battery, AFTER verifying the process with your owner's manual.

P.S. - No offence meant for the buyers of this great product - but just to get a little bit of insight of what a typical Brezza buyer looks for in a car. Glad that you asked the question. In fact, your post has most of the answers. It's a brilliant combination of all the above characteristics that you can find in a single car which makes it unique and highest selling. Add to that the good looks, reliable and proven engine, big tyres, ground clearance, road presence, competitive pricing for a feature loaded car and most importantly peace of mind of MASS. The 'Kitna Deti Hai' aspect is also another reason for those who need a compact good looking wannabe SUV for a small middle class Indian family. As I said it may not excel in any particular aspect but would tick most of the boxes and hence it is in demand as it suits the requirement of the majority. Glorified amplified hatchback may not be a proper description. A wannabe SUV may be a much better and appropriate description. Though it may not have off road capabilities of a 4 x 4 but for rough roads, it does handle and absorb most of it really well. In fact you would agree that someone who is looking at proper off roading abilities, they would not buy a Brezza for sure and would consider a Thar, Gypsy or a Gurkha. The high seating position of Ignis cannot be compared with Brezza by any stretch of imagination. Not even Wagon R or Ritz for that matter, both of which I have owned. You may like to test drive one and experience the road presence and visibility. The seating position is higher than a Duster/ Terrano though both of them are in another segment and not a sub 4 metre SUV. Boot space is reasonably good with the option of a 60:40 split which an Amaze or the like may not provide. All the cars (including 7 seater SUVs) claim that the 2nd row can seat 3 passengers, some of them comfortably and some others may be good for 2 healthy adults. As such, the same cannot be a distinguishing feature. Hope I have been able to throw some light on the mindset of a typical Brezza owner.", 15th March 2017,maruti-vitara-brezza,Gurgaon,287,541

Lemme try and answer you as I myself am in the lookout for an upgrade to premium hatch/pseudo-SUV(for lack of a better word) segment. I actually asked a few owners of Brezza in my circle and this is what I noticed: 1. Most of them were upgrading from B segment(Wagon R, Estilo, i10 etc) and needed a little more spacious car as family was growing. But the compact sedans didn't make the cut for them as they dont look proportional at all and I agree with them here . No offence meant to owners as its to each his own. 2. Most of them don't want to go for sedans(I mean proper sedans like city, vento etc) due to parking constraints, lower ground clearance(this is a HUGE factor mind you in Bangalore like city full of potholes) etc. 3. Higher ground clearance as their smaller hatches did take some considerable beating lately with the pothole sizes ever-increasing. 4. Families are growing with kids so rear seating 3 is pretty important. 5. The ones from Maruti background didnt want to risk any other brand, non-marutis wanted a peace-of-mind ownership after bad experiences with their previous OEM A.S.S. 6. Resale as its a Maruti and a successful product. This drifted them away from Ecosport although some of them loved it but were scared about resale Brezza is proportionate with high ground clearance, proven engine, decent space inside. Its like what the official review says does most things right without any particular USP(Maybe brand name?).

My drive is about 120 KMS everyday within NCR and long drives once every 3 months for at least 1500kms (return). I am going to test drive Brezza today in the afternoon. Please help ! I did a few quick calculations. It would cost you approx 2K more diesel expense pm if you assume Baleno will give you 18kmpl & 22kmpl (IMO, the mileage diff. would be near to 2.5kmpl, not 4kmpl) Assumption: 150kms for 22 working days & 500km for weekend driver (per month) If you're spending something close to a millions bucks, 2000pm shouldn't matter. You're going to drive the car and if the car doesn't put a smile on your face, it simply isn't worth it. Try to convince her like this.. if you go with Brezza, you might be wasting 2-3K bucks per month however if you go with Baleno & you simply don't like it, you'll be wasting 30k+ bucks per month (EMI). I purchased two cars during the previous year, faced the classic head vs heart dilemma during both the purchases. Followed my heart during one (XUV 5OO vs Jetta) & head during the other (Ecosport vs Brezza). If I can go back to the time, I might reverse the decision where I followed my head but I have absolutely no doubts regarding the purchase where I followed my heart.

Personally, I would go with Brezza any day simply because of its road presence and visibility apart from many other factors, which is pivotal in so far as NCR traffic is concerned. The couch seating of Baleno doesn't inspire much confidence. However, it's completely a personal preference as you see as many Balenos as the Brezza. As regards mileage, having driven Maruti cars for a substantial period of time, I doubt whether the Baleno actually gives the mileage of 22 kmpl in NCR traffic with AC on always, as claimed. I have done about 7000 kms in my Brezza and am getting 18.5 to 19 kmpl. The daily distance covered by me is approximately 80 Kms and also involves stretch in NH8 with speeds upto 110 kms/hr. I am sure if I restrict it to 80-90kms/hr or after servicing at 10000 kms on the ODO it would exceed 20 kmpl.

It came factory fitted with Apollo Alnac 4GS 215/16/R16. Need help from the tyre experts here, what's the best? I'm looking at good tyre life, should be tough enough to take Indian roads, dry & wet grip, not exactly looking for comfort. I drive almost always on highways & occasionally on broken roads.

I was pleasantly surprised by the Apollo Alnac 4GS. They're are not great, but get the job done. I have done some high speeds & also driven them on horrible roads & they've performed well, just two punctures & no other problems. So... My question is should I stick to Apollo Alnac 4GS or try Continental MC5 or Michelin 3ST?

There was a worry whether the alloy wheel will fit correctly in the boot. Happy to report that if you place it upside down (like the steel wheel), it fits correctly in the slot and can be secured by the original clamp provided as well. I wonder why Maruti does not give this spare alloy by default. The only issue is that the tire valve goes on the back side - so will have to remove the wheel to check air pressure . Only solution for that is to over inflate the spare tire, so the need to check it often is not there.

Guess it would be the 1.0L boosterjet as that would make it eligible for the sub 4m benefit(post GST is it still valid?) and it has better numbers(torque & hp) than the 1.4NA. And that would actually give them a reason(read higher sales than Baleno RS) to localize the engine and make it cost effective both for Maruti and the customers. What needs to be seen is how it performs with the additional weight of the Brezza compared to Baleno RS. Usually small turbo petrols are known to have lag lower down the rev-band but what makes me hopeful is almost all the reviews of Baleno RS state that the engine is pretty linear in terms of power delivery. If that's the case with Brezza petrol as well, am sure lot of customers would prefer this over ecosport Ecoboost which is known for its initial lag. Not everyone needs a diesel but still Brezza is seeing tremendous demand. Once petrol MT & AMT/CVT is launched it will further shoot up.

My experience: XM2 : Extremely comfort oriented. Low noise & good grip levels however it did not face rough roads much. So can't comment on it. Alnac: Can take good amount of abuse. Good grip (not as good as P3ST). A little noisier compared to XM2/P3ST). P3ST: Superb grip levels, specially during cornering. Comfortable (More than Alnac, a little less than XM2). A lot more silent than Alnac but a tad noisier than XM2. Again, they barely encountered rough roads so can't comment on it. I would recommend P3ST unless the roads you unusually drive are in extremely poor condition. You may want to go for Alnac if you don't like to push the car, don't mind a little noise inside the cabin, can compromise on comfort & would want to drive through rough roads with somewhat more peace of more. --------------------- Ahmedabad faced torrential rains yesterday. I had to drive through a puddle (or at least I thought so) as the underpass I usually use was closed due to water logging. After driving a few feet into the puddle, it started to get deeper. Soon, the water level was upto the Suzuki symbol under bonnet. I kept the car moving at around 3000 rpm in the first gear with AC turned off. It successfully waded such deep water for the approx 250m water-logged stretch. Not that I advocate such 'stunt' but if an emergency situation arises, one can trust Brezza to wade through at least couple of feet deep water. I accessed the car for any potential damage post the unintended stunt. Front licence plate was bent & a few plastic pieces managed to go pass through the front grill; I removed them. I have driven the car for more than 20kms after that & it works fine. Is there anything else that I should get checked at the workshop?", 29th July 2017,maruti-vitara-brezza,Pune/Ahmedabad,365,483

Coming to the tyres part: My cousin knew an old friend who works in Michelin who got me a good deal. Michelin has something called ""Friends & Family offer"", wherein they give a 20% discount for Michelin employees. Only 4 tyres are offered under this scheme. A unique discount code is generated under the employees name & you're asked to buy it from a specific dealership. I bought 4 tyres under the offer & paid MRP price for the 5th tyre. The MRP for Primacy 3ST (215/60 R16 size) was ₹9800. The offer for 4 tyres was ₹31168 (₹7792 per tyre) I brought the 5th tyre for ₹9750. This turned out to be the cheapest price, cheaper than even JK tyres or Apollo Alnac (Apollo quote ₹8000 per tyre) Wheel Alignment, Balancing, weights & tyre neck valve change done free of cost.

Rain and drizzle are completely different, a light drizzle will form a slippery coat on the road, this increases braking distances. Rain actually removes the oil and the risk is mostly from aquaplaning. That's why it's easier to drive on grass when it's raining than when it's wet.

The MJD is no fun to drive. I hope they launch a decent petrol version similar to their Baleno RS with a good non-cvt/non-amt auto box. And what is the price-bracket that you want the Brezza with these specifications to be launched? Maruti is a mass market player after all. Doesn't make too much of a business case to create a niche variant of a vehicle that is supposed to sell in high volume in order to ensure good profitability. When a car already has a long waiting period, the company also has to make judicious use of the available bandwidth on the assembly line. Neither CVT, nor AMT - then which box would you prefer? A torque converter? A dual clutch one will simply make the car so expensive that people will buy a full size car/SUV instead. I drive the 1.3 MJD. 100% that it is not an engine that will make one enjoy the ride from an adrenaline rush aspect. And indeed it is very old now. There are better engines available. No doubt about that at all. But then I don't think Maruti wants to target the audience with hair-raising performance as a USP at all...A trade-off is made to make all ends meet I would say. Bulk customers want the ""SUV"". Many would buy it without caring about whether it has a 1.3/1.6 MJD or a wick-burner stove under the bonnet. Remember that 20k bookings were made even before launch, people not even asking for a test ride!

Agreed Maruti doesnt have an alternate diesel engine less than 1.5L. But for a normal family person I think his only consideration will be whether his car will be able to move people and luggage with great fuel efficiency. I am not comfortable with its turbo lag. I wish for a larger engine than our national engine, so that it doesnt have to be stressed so much for power and torque. I think its limit has reached. Its high time they bring a couple of options. But I find comfort in one thing. No matter where we go we can have proper service, because most mechanics or even some owners for that matter will have inside out knowledge about this engine .

I've got the gear lock installed from an accessory shop in Gurgaon. It's a straight one, pin type and not the U type.

There's one issue, you have to slide the seat back for locking it and unlocking it.

Thank you, No need to change both rear tyres if you're not changing the brand and sticking with Apollo. In this case, you can use the tyre from stepney and get it mounted on the alloys and the tyre from the other rear one should go on to the stepney rim. Pick up one new tyre and then you'll have one new and one relatively new (from stepney) tyres and use them in front. The tyre size of stepney is same as those on alloys.

Frustration about high beamed Brezzas... We all know how the Swift has sold over the last decade. It is beyond doubt the sportiest car of its age in this country. But it was also one of blind aspiration for a lot of uninformed yet sufficiently wealthy folk. Result - there are/were infinite (especially white) Swifts everywhere. Also sadly in the hands of the uneducated / uninformed / innocently ignorant / plain arrogant. The people who drive their cars always with high beam, with 0 regard for the oncoming traffic. A decade is exactly the time when still most of Indians switch cars. Enter - Vitara Brezza. A perfectly timed and - yes exactly like the Swift - well made car that touches the correct nerve of the people and ticks all the boxes. Vast majority of the aforementioned gentlemen are upgrading now to the Brezza daily. And sadly - they drive with those even more powerful headlamps on high beams. This time with twin barrels, modded LED lights and what not. The Brezza's lights are obviously higher than the Swift & are position very well to burn holes into oncoming drivers' eyes. Then a lot of these guys upgrade light wattage / change to HIDs without proper care about housing / projector etc and its inexplicable. I'm unnecessarily ending up cursing this car every night when driving home on low-beams myself thanks to these people. Not that other cars don't do this. There were simply too many Swifts on the road...And now there are too many Brezzas...

Don't feel frustrated. It's a problem shared by many but singling out a single car is of no use. The worst lights which blind the traffic are those from Tata Magic and their ilk. And then those from true blue SUVs like Safari and Scorpio or the taxi driven Boleros, they're blinding even to the guy sitting in a Brezza. Basically getting blinded can happen in any car, if you sit in a low slung sedan or smaller hatchbacks. As far as light modifications are concerned, that all depends on the driving manners and traffic system education which sadly in non-existent in our country.

The petrol engine is expected to be a 1.0-litre Boosterjet engine that also powers the Baleno RS in the current line-up. The petrol engine will come with CVT automatic transmission.

He zeroed on the Nissan Terrano but since his father is stuck with the reliability of Maruti Suzuki, he has to abide by his decision. Earlier they have used Ritz VDI for close to 5 years which has 2,50,000 km on odo and still going strong. Few of the first hand observations are: At an On-Road price of 930,000 Interior Quality is very poor. No soft touch materials even the door handles plastics are not upto the mark. Would say highly disappointed in this department. Most of the bells and whistles are saved for the Top End model, though it gets everything covered in the Safety department since they have opted for the VDI(O) model. Providing manual AC controls is not an issue, but believe me even the cars on half the price point would have better Switch/Knob quality. Poor NVH levels. Good points which I found is the high seating position and good all around visibility. I happened to drive a petrol car on a regular basis since last 5 years but didn't find any issues with the driveability of this car.Highly tractable Engine, tuned in such a way that one will not feel much lag under 2000 rpm. Surprised with the way it was eating up all the road undulations with such ease. Minor speed breakers were not even felt inside the cabin. May be I felt this way more since I happen to drive BALENO and suspension is it's pain point since beginning.

(Android app doesn't upload images for some reason) I can understand the frustration you must be experiencing. Having lived with 3 Marutis in my garage for last 14 years, here are some handy tips: 1. Be precise about what your car needs in 10k periodic maintenance. Maruti terms 10k/30k/50k as minor service and 20k/40k/60k as major. But what really inflates the bills are typical service items that are not needed like engine decarbonisation etc. So be as explicit as possible with respect to the service items that are needed for the car. Get tire realignment and balancing outside. 2.Get the fog lamp checked outside. It can be a loose connection also. I have had my share of issues with fog lamp which is a shared part across plethora of Maruti cars. Even if the fog lamp has conked off, the cost of the bulb is cheaper outside. Should be under 150 rupees. 3. It depends how you see and perceive reliability. A bulb getting conked off is probably an overkill for measuring reliability - of course, it's still not something that is expected . Having said that, Maruti is definitely not the cheapest to maintain. I have learnt it over a period of time how to stay out of unnecessary service items and I am happy with all 3 petrol cars in my garage. Just to give you a fair idea, I just spent 2400 rupees for 70k service on dzire. Good luck and keep munching miles", 12th November 2017,maruti-vitara-brezza,Gurgaon,552,"1,544"

Will try to be helpful with what I’m currently equipped with in relation to your questions. Please see below based on my conversations with other owners in this forum who've positive feedback about Wolf; 1) Wolf Moto looks to be a promising tuner based on various threads here in forum highlighting the service support these guys have on offer. 2) I am not sure if it can be done on fly because its not mentioned anywhere yet. But with just throttle input with the ignition in ON position should help you switch between the maps. NO hardware required to switch. Just use the A pedal (experts correct me if I'm wrong) 3) Turbo charged engines should follow this turbo rule is what I learnt after reading our own forums article here Since you aren't really planning on keeping the car for 1L kms, then I do not think you shouldn't be worried unless you clock the lakh kms quickly depending on your usage.

1276, jbpanda , 00:37 ,BHPian,"Just did a 600 Kms short weekend trip from Gurgaon to Nahan and returned back this evening. On my way back from Nahan to Gurgaon on NH1 (between Karnal to Panipat) at about 4 PM a street dog ran across and jumped pass the divider to cross the highway. Unfortunately, it came in front of my Brezza and hit the middle of the bumper and I could not save it. Possibly it was on a suicide mission. Nevertheless felt very bad about not being able to save it. I saw on my ORVM that a small piece of the bumper broken on the road. The car was at about 90-95 kmph on the middle lane. As there were several cars behind me in the same lane as well as other lanes doing almost same speeds, sudden braking would have risked a chance of another car rear ending. Sudden lane change would also have been risky. We stopped after about 10 minutes when I checked the bumper and found a small portion of the mesh grille broken and the under body plastic scratch protector also broken leading to a clattering sound when the engine is idle, but manageable. I also checked if everything was fine under the bonnet and it appeared to be fine. After driving for few hours including 1 hour in heavy traffic before entering Delhi (between Sonipat and Delhi border), I saw the engine temperature warning signal on with the temperature bar rising every Km. Due to heavy traffic, I could not stop the car until we reached a petrol pump by which time the bar had reached the maximum position. In the meanwhile, I had switched off the AC and turned off the car as soon as I parked it at the petrol pump. Opened the bonnet and allowed about 15 minutes to cool off. Checked the owner's manual, checked coolant level for leakage and any damage in other parts, but everything appeared to be fine. I could not find any reason for overheating except for correlating it with temporary overheating which was mentioned in the manual and followed the directions to wait till the engine cools on its own. I also found a possible reason that was mentioned in the manual as problem with water pump belt but could not co-relate I checked the ignition after waiting for 30 minutes or so and the temperature level was normal. I decided to slowly return home by maintaining speeds below 80 kmph and keeping the AC off. The temperature bar was normal all throughout until we reached home. I also tried doing speeds above 80 kmph, switching on the AC from Delhi to Gurgaon, etc but it was normal as if the overheating signal had never shown. Planning to take it to the service centre tomorrow to sort out the bumper and also try to find out the reason for the overheating light. Has anyone had a similar experience?

I visited MASS, one of the SAs from workshop came with me for a test drive. He concluded that there was no issue with Shock Absorber, the noise was because of the loose spare wheel. He tightened up the spare wheel. I used my car for one more day, that annoying noise was still there. Next day I approached GM- MS Workshop. I asked him to drive alone and check the noise. He took a small test drive on a bad patch. He was convinced that there was some odd noise from Left shock absorber. They checked my car on priority and came up with the issue of a faulty rear shock absorber. GM told me that they will replace it under warranty. I remained present to see the replacement of shock absorber assembly. The part was replaced. GM, Workshop himself took a test drive and confirmed that its ok now. I checked it, the issue was solved.", 10th January 2018,maruti-vitara-brezza,Anand(GJ23),"1,572","5,947"

1284, bhavik.1991 , 14:46 ,BHPian,"After a few minor niggles here & there during two years of ownership, I have started facing not-so minor issue. Bhpians input will be much appreciated. Accelerator pedal stops working intermittently . Let me elaborate. Let's say I am driving at ~40kmph in 3rd gear with slight tap on accelerator. Out of nowhere, fuel supply is cut to the engine & it behaves as if I have lifted my foot from the accelerator. It is not specific to any gear as I have experienced it in 2nd,3rd & 4th gears so far (Car remains slotted in these gears 80% of time during my daily drive). I experienced it for the first time during a tight overtaking manoeuvre, I was going at 1200 rpm in 3rd, shifted to 2nd for the overtake, floored the pedal & was waiting for the turbo to spool in its full glory & make me grin but I was absolutely shocked once the engine reached approx 1900 rpm. It gave up on me as if I lifted my foot from the accelerator. Fortunately, there was no other vehicle behind the one I was overtaking, I break-ed hard & went behind the slow moving vehicle. Everything was normal after this close escape. I tapped the accelerator gently & the car responded. Yesterday, it happened once again under way better circumstances. I was cruising at approx 45kmph (4th gear) on an empty stretch & the accelerator gave up on me. This time I didn't lift my foot but pressed it a little bit more. Nothing happened... a little more, still nothing. I floored the pedal, still nothing! I lifted my foot from the accelerator & tap the accelerator back gently in a micro second, it behaved as expected & things went back to the normal! Experienced similar behavior once more so it can be concluded if the accelerator pedal gives up, I need to lift my foot & tap it once again to get it going. One more thing, I am not sure whether it is related to this accelerator pedal issue. Couple of days back, break lights were still lit after I parked my car. I went behind the car & tail light housing was quite hot (The lights must have on for a while). I unlocked the car, pressed the break pedal (without starting the car) & voila the lights went off. I played with a little bit more yesterday& concluded that break pedal doesn't come all the way back after I release it hence the issue. I checked the floor mats & it wasn't interfering with any of the pedals. Moreover, I have been using the same mats for couple of years. I also checked A & B pedals for anything unusual (in the dark with my hands) but couldn't find anything. Can anyone think of any probable cause for the accelerator issue? My experience with MASS has been nothing short for horrible so far, so I can't count much on them (need to try a new workshop this time). Also, the warranty expires in April, does this issue warrant the need of an extended warranty?", 7th February 2018,maruti-vitara-brezza,Pune/Ahmedabad,365,483

1288, theREDcamero , 21:29 ,Newbie,"Hey fellas, Let me summarize my little cliché, layman car-search. My budget was around 9 lakhs to 10 lakhs, the lower the better. My monthy run is about 1500 km, partly city and partly highway. I wanted a car to seat four which gave me standard safety kit, decent mileage and a comfortable ride with big car looks and bother-free after sales-service and a was pleasure to drive..tall ask, but i was on the search. I conveniently left out the sedans and the hatch backs as they did not have the snob-value or the big car feel. I was heavily tempted by the new generation of dzire but closely stuck to my initial primary interests. A few days into this fray, i gradually concluded that i had to make a compromise on any one of my longings as such a unique car of my liking has not been made yet. Soon i found myself prioritizing the needs in my new car and with some mild distress, taking into consideration my current not-so-flair financial-status and family-limitations, i did leave my driving-pleasure penchant to the last.( n b - i currently drive around in a first gen figo) Thus compact-diesel-SUV was the niche where i had my money in and there were only five real competitors. In almost all shoot outs by car experts this was the order of picking  ECOSPORT>NEXON>WRV>BREZZA>TUV 300. ECOSPORT was my first choice as it ticked most boxes but i left it out as the Ford motor company sales a hovered around three percent in India and i was reminded of Chevrolet disowning its customers. The back seat was not that wide either and it was on the outer spectrum of my budget. NEXON had some very minor quality niggles and she looked like a bloated up hatchback albeit being very stylish and fun to drive. Neither did Tata after-sales-service help nor did the 6 percent market share of TATA, but TATA cannot leave India, right? WRV never really was my choice as it was in reality a JAZZ-CROSS and was way more expensive. TUV 300..i took a little time to think over this unique offering from Mahindra..it almost bore everything i wanted..i had felt like i hit the purple patch of this car search until i drove the 84 bhp slug. Oh boy..it does not impress..more over just a three cylinder pot and the 100hp 7 seater crossed my budget line. Then came BREZZA..everything that i wanted sans driving pleasure. Phew..i had to go with it this time. Though i was not a big fan of MARUTI and its policies towards Indian customers, i am now honeypotted..loving it! NB - i dont like S-CROSS looks,period.

Though i was not a big fan of MARUTI and its policies towards Indian customers, i am now honeypotted..loving it! Brezza indeed would tick most of the requirement of a typical Indian customer. Though looks are subjective, it appeals to the majority because of its stance, road presence and overall reliability. It comfortably sits 3 healthy adults in the rear. It provides excellent visibility all round and the big wide 16"" deal with most of the roads pretty well.

However, resetting the Trip to '0' will not reset the AVG FE display at least in most Maruti Suzuki cars I have noticed. So not sure how that can be different in Brezza. In Ciaz and Dzire too, I know I had to reset the AVG FE display for my friend/colleague.

Fitment of aftermarket or even MGP Fog Lamps is not a straightforward task as it involves a bit of complex wiring if you want to make this work like how it works on higher end variants. OE Switch has to be installed, wiring done in a way that fogs function only when the parking lights/head lights are on etc. Quote: 2. Steering mounted audio controls is absent in VDI. Can we get this added too from a dealer? I am looking for MGA part only. Not easy again, if your actual Music System doesn't support this. And there are interfaces available but you will have to spend time understanding how things work in the first place. Parts are definitely available but there will be a lot of auxiliary parts you will need to make it work, not to forget a clean execution of the whole task. Quote: 3. Rear wipe- can this also be fixed? Can certainly be fixed but will come at a cost and the following complexities: - Location of the wiper (and a hole needs to be drilled) - Location of the washer nozzle (and the associated fitting) - Routing of the water hose all the way from the tail to the reservoir under the bonnet - By removing a lot of body panels Quote: 4. Diesel additives - This is my 1st diesel car and i am confused on this. Can someone please explain the benefits of this ? You really don't need any additives unless you have started to face any performance issues. You only ensure to refill at a reliable fuel station all the times and that will take care of things on long run. Among the first 3, the easiest still would be installing the fog lamps and the wiring for the same. You can refer to this (Maruti Celerio DIY - Fog lights and DRL installation)post for the same and you will get ideas as the concept remains the same - Switch, Routing of wiring etc etc. In the end I would say enjoy your ride in its present state and modify strictly based on needs and not for fancy reasons - In fact, I have been contemplating on steering mounted controls since the day I bought, even researched a lot on that and gradually that zeal has mellowed down now.

1438, shajoshi , 09:28 ,BHPian," Quote: 1) how important is Hill Assist? I drive a lot in the ghats so wondering if I will be able to use the hand brake just in the same way If you can pull the handbrake on an incline and slowly release it while pressing the accelerator (like a manual) you can prevent the car from rolling back - which is what hill assist would automate. This should be fairly easy for any driver who knows how to drive a manual transmission car. Quote: 2) how effective is the AGS when climbing steep inclines? Is the torque enough? No difference, as the same gear box and ratios are used. You may have to run the AGS box in M mode (manually selecting gear ratio) as the AGS sometimes hunts for the right gear on inclines (keeps toggling between 2 and 3 gear), and also when you want to employ engine braking downhill. Quote: 3) what is the Fuel efficiency of this AGS variant in the actual world not what Maruti claims? Should be no different, since AGS has same gearbox. It could be better if driven with a light foot, since the AGS box shifts up quickly. Quote: 4) Any idea if Maruti Suzuki planning of launching brezza with 1.5L petrol or 1.5 L diesel? What I heard previously was that they are working on 1.5 L diesel motor. But no signs of that coming until now. No idea..", 6th September 2018,maruti-vitara-brezza,Pune,97,171

There are 2 things that are still in my mind which I wanted to share and get some feedback. 1. Last week I read on Team-BHP that issues were reported on the steering wheel (noise and stickiness) of Baleno, S-Cross and Vitara Brezza. It was mentioned in that report that for those vehicle under warranty the steering assembly would be changed and for those NOT under warranty, the Service Center would change it as a goodwill and claim from Maruti. I had the same issue; but the Service Center spoke to Maruti technicians and did some changes/replacements. Now the noise and stickiness is gone and steering is working flawless and smooth. I have told the Service Center that it will be under observation for sometime before I give my satisfaction to the work done. Anyone else faced this issue? Please share what was the resolution provided by MASS. 2. The Service center guys, updated the Touch Screen Navigation system. I was expecting Android Auto on the display. To my disappointment, MASS said no Android Auto official with Maruti. The new version also does not show the version of the firmware. Anybody can confirm this. I have seen people updating versions themselves to 1740, 1850... etc. But has anyone got it updated from the MASS.", 4th October 2018,maruti-vitara-brezza,Mumbai,37,59

The production of Indias no1 SUV Vitara Brezza has increased 10% to 94,000 units during April-Oct 2018-19 compared to same months last year. Announcing the increased production and availability of Vitara Brezza, Mr. R.S. Kalsi, Senior Executive Director (Marketing and Sales), Maruti Suzuki said, The high demand for our popular models such as the Vitara Brezza is a testimony of our best in class technology, design and customer experience. With the Suzuki Motor Gujarat plant operational at its full capacity of 2.5 lakh units annually in Gujarat, we are able to increase the output. We are confident that with the reduced waiting period, we will be able to enhance the car buying and ownership experience of our customers. In 2017-18, Maruti Suzuki sold over 1.48 lakh units of Vitara Brezza. During the first seven months (April-October) of 2018-19, the company has clocked sales of around 95,000 units of Vitara Brezza. Launched in March 2016, Maruti Suzukis Vitara Brezza had become an instant hit. It has achieved the fastest 3 lakh sales mark in the SUV segment in just 28 months. It has been consistently clocking numbers much higher than several competition products put together. With Vitara Brezza, Maruti Suzuki introduced dual-tone colours  a first in its segment, which have got high acceptance with customers. Maruti Suzuki has sold over 3.57 lakh units of Vitara Brezza cumulatively since launch. In May 2018, Maruti Suzukis revolutionary two-pedal technology, Auto Gear Shift, was offered on Vitara Brezza. Auto Gear Shift has received overwhelming response from customers with its penetration as high as 49% in Mumbai and 39% in Delhi. At the same time, the exterior and interior features were upgraded to enhance the bold and sporty character of the countrys most popular SUV.

Making recalls public make people angry with the QC and what not, because they will get to know there is something wrong with their car well in advance. If you do a silent recall people won’t be knowing the issue with their car until they come for service and the benefactors would actually go ‘you know I got an excellent service experience from...’.

Even if the TD car was ill-maintained and is the culprit here, Maruti comes off like an arrogant hunk and its customers seem like pretty girls; all the hunk has to do is show up and not make an effort to please or impress the girl. I doubt if my manager will book a Brezza even though he likes its height and tall-person friendly ergonomics... Exactly my feelings after test driving both cars and I ended up buying a Nexon though I was inclined towards the Brezza after driving a similar Vitara overseas. The only thing in common with the overseas model was the shape. The interiors, NVH was not even comparable with the overseas model.

1581, hkollar , 10:16 ,BHPian,"I bought a Brezza in September. After having used an Innova for 14yrs now, it was time to change, but I didn't want another Innova, which the family felt is too big for city. My wife or daughters refuse to take it out. So, my lookout as for a reasonably safe highway car, that you won't hate to take out in City. We had a Zen Estilo to exchange too. I needed an automatic, with high ground clearance. WRV didn't have an automatic, so it was ruled out. I liked Ecosport. But it has an overpriced automatic (They have stopped trend line automatic), and it's rear seat seemed cramped. I did not like Venue. I felt even the driver seat was cramped. In the segment Nexon and XUV are far more better engineered cars, if you can put up with niggling problems and relatively poor after sale experience. Especially Nexon. I loved the feeling within the car. But, I did not consider XUV or NEXON at all, because my experience of after sales service and reliability with Indian manufacturers hasn't been very good. So, my choice narrowed down to Brezza. It is clearly a compromise. Positives: - Little more spacious than all cars, except XUV. - Suzuki Reliability, peace of mind - 4Star NCAP, making it suitable for highway - AMT is decent enough, especially in manual mode - Fuel efficiency Negatives: - Seats are tad bit narrow. I measured the seats. It is 18inch x 18inch in driver's seat. My Innova measures 19x19inches. So clearly, I may have been pampered by the seat size of Innova. On it's own driver seats may be OKish, but rear seats may tire someone if they sit continously for 5-6hrs. - NVH levels aren't too good. I got 3M damping done, but still I can hear the road noise, and engine noise a bit more than I'd have ideally liked. - Suspension is a bit stiff in certain circumstances. Ride is not as plush as Ertiga for example. But, high speed ride is comfortable enough. - Dirver seat is more inside, thus ingress/egress is a bit more difficult than even Innova. Brezza still is big for the city. My wife & I end up arguing over who will take drive out the E2O. Who ever has business in congested area ends up taking the E2O. E2O has no competition as a city car. But, as a mix of highway & city, Brezza works out OK.", 6th October 2019,maruti-vitara-brezza,Bangalore,261,416

1583, sumitmajumdarin , 02:05 ,Newbie,"After purchasing the MS Vitara Brezza ZDi in wee 2019, I was quite confident that the light output from stock projectors would be adequate for highway driving, but to my utter surprise, the stock H7 halogen projectors throw literally a feeble beam on the highway and without switching on the high beams, it's impossible to see the road even on a clear night. As it is not feasible to drive on with the high beams throughout, owing to glare caused to oncoming vehicles, you have to depend on low beam projectors and equally inadequate stock fog lamps. This is nothing short of experiencing a chilled spine out on a dark night on the highway. Heard of an accident where the poor guy ploughed his Brezza into a stationary road roller parked on the highway due to visibility issues with stock lights. -- Hacks tried: 01. Upgraded projectors with Philips Xtreme Vision Plus halogen H7 (55W) bulbs. Benefits: Nothing. Investment wasted! 02. Upgraded projectors with Philips Xtreme Ultinon LED H7 units. Benefits: Pure white light and premium looks for the vehicle; no improvement in visibility. Investment wasted! 03. Upgraded projectors with Osram 4300K HID Xenarc 35W Gen-1 conversion kit. Benefits: Light output from projector low beams increased roughly twice than what was before. The colour of 4300K light is between yellow halogens and pure white LEDs, it is much like daylight and a breeze to locate hurdles in the dark. Investment paid off to an extent! -- What I discovered: After investing a total of around 17K-18K (INR) in 3 bulb upgrades, I discovered that the stock projectors in Brezza, even with the Osram HIDs, could not throw workable amount of light to illuminate the roads. Tried aligning the bulbs in every possible way, but output from projectors was still devoid of a clear cut-off and the beam pattern was weird; it was in an 'U' shape where the peripheral sides of vehicle had illumination but the centre was not properly illuminated. To lessen glare, the stock projectors sport a ribbed lens, which further cuts light output. Regarding auxiliary lights, I have swapped stock fogs with a pair of Osram LEDriving DRL-cum-fog LED setup from our earlier Wagon R. The fogs are of no use on the highways though; they just do their job of glowing as DRLs during the day, as cornering lights, as pure white & energy efficient fog lights as well as hazard lights. Also, I have got a Hella 350 12LED 25W light bar installed on top of registration plate with Hella brackets, which is aligned between high & low beam lengths. I use the Hella LED bar with the Osram HIDs in stock projectors & Osram LED fogs to get the job of low beam illumination done. Reflector high beams on the Brezza surprisingly are really outstanding in throw and intensity. -- Next upgrade plan: Going for bi-xenon projectors in quad setup retrofitted from professionals in factory headlight assemblies. Hella G5-BRT or Hella G7-BRTs with Osram or Philips HIDs are preferably on the cards. They are capable enough to churn out intense 'light' which will be all-weather friendly and can instill confidence to drive on highways at night. The Osram LED fogs and Hella LED bar will remain as they are now, but I hope the quad setup so planned can alone handle the darkest of the dark nights with ease.", 24th October 2019,maruti-vitara-brezza,Balurghat,19,36

Yes most stock lenses come with a ribbed pattern & also an offset layer in the top part of the lens to control/diffuse glare. Externally when looked at, the Brezza, Ciaz, Nexon lenses seem quite identical. Yet we are seeing quite a few reports of the Osram HID performance not being too good on the Brezza. I'm wondering why. It has been reported frequently to be very good on the Ciaz. So Maruti uses different projector setups on these 2 cars perhaps? But I don't see a reason why they'd do so!

A good IPHCAR/CrystalEye 55W conversion kit will surely give far better output. It might solve your problem far cheaper.

Hella 350 LED bars are available in 3 variants: flood, high beam and pencil beam. I have selected the high beam type, having 12 LEDs with individual micro projectors, which have got a sharp cut-off line and throw similar to high beam headlights. Hella says that the pencil beam variant is strictly for off-highway, agricultural and commercial use, while flood and high beam ones can be used on highways, provided they are correctly aligned. I have aligned the LED bar in such a way that it hits just below the stock high beam mark, which is why oncoming vehicles do not get blinded by the strong light, while giving me a good visibility. Police at several highway 'naka-checkings' have not asked me to turn off or dismantle the light bar. However, each time I visit a new place, I always put on an opaque cover (designed by and for the LED bar by Hella) during the daytime, so that I do not have to face any unwarranted hurdle from the local Police. Believe me, this Hella LED bar is a great companion on the highways when you have weak headlights. Quote: Originally Posted by BoneCollector Choose your retrofitter properly.

See you around on the forum mate. As for the reverse not engaging - I assume this happens when you are in some forward gear, then shift to neutral & then to reverse? If thats right - I assume you are granny-shifting. I.e. - the clutch is still depressed when you make the Forward -> Neutral -> reverse shift? If yes, this is fairly common since the reverse gear is on a sliding mesh & not synchro mesh together with the forward gears. So the teeth don't engage directly. Try this - after shifting to neutral, release the clutch pedal fully. Then depress it again. Then shift to reverse. With time, make it a habit to double-clutch when shifting to reverse from a forward gear. Let me know if this helps .", 8th January 2020,maruti-vitara-brezza,Pune,"4,834","17,603"

I have had this issue in my Swift VDi for 8 long years, and trust me, it is not an issue at all. Just do not put unnecessary pressure on the gear lever. I am systematically incorporating these tips into my driving style. Frankly, this never happened with my earlier car (Zen Estilo), which got me thinking that something might be wrong with the car.

You are right about the mic part in ZDI's stock unit. In fact, the new ICE unit also has a mic on the unit itself. ZDI and ZDI+ have the same overhead light console. This means the external mic can be rerouted here, provided there is space for it (I think the external mic is somewhat longer and may not be housed there, not sure of this). as far as the wiring length is concerned, its long enough to go there, as the installer has brought it from behind the ICE unit, through the left side A pillar via the roof liner to the driver side A pillar.

It has reverse camera compatibility, radio, bluetooth telephony, USB, and Apple Car Play/Android Auto. Note that it has a single USB port only. If you need more USB ports, you may choose XAV-5000. Camera was installed by my dealer. However, they did not install it near the number plate. It is on the bumper, along with the parking sensors. The external mic is fixed on the A pillar, but I want to move that to the overhead cabin light console. The system is absolutely compatible with the steering mounted controls. The reverse cam view is hooked to the reverse gear. Overall, it works just fine for my intended use. Note that it does not have wireless Android Auto/Apple Car play. I also upgraded my front speakers to components, as the stock sound was horrible. You may ignore this if the stock setup is good. It is a simple install and your installer can help you out with an appropriate fascia for the new ICE unit, so that it sits flush with the dashboard. Also consider damping the doors to improve sound. It significantly improves the audio experience. Cost HU: 16,000 Camera: dont remember (should not be too high). The night clarity is not very clear in my case. Nevertheless, I am used to rear view and side view mirrors and parking sensors for reversing, the rear view display was my wife's idea Component speakers: 8500 ( Polk DB+ 6502) You may need a separate harness for the installation. Your installer will guide you. These units will also allow you to upgrade your audio experience with amps and subs, should you feel the need to do so ( I plan to get an amp later). As for the HU, you can choose from a number of manufacturers. Some even have wireless Android Auto/Car play. This is entirely upto your requirements and budget. I avoided the cheaper Chinese units and Android units as I am not sure about their reliability. You may want to explore them too. Some drivers may be interested in playing videos on the ICE unit. I feel its a bad idea. I have given a Tablet to my daughter to watch videos at the rear seat (with seat belts on). Strictly no video watching on the HU for me or my wife. I did not consider Aux/CD/Mirrorlink while upgrading. Attaching some pics for your use.", 24th August 2020,maruti-vitara-brezza,"KA-03,",52,111

Brezza indeed has very poor headlight illumination especially in ZDi and ZDi+ variants. Upgrading to HID fogs is a very good option.

I have upgraded low beam projector headlights on my Brezza ZDi (2018) with a set of 4200Kelvin Osram DH7 35 watt Gen1 HID conversion kit, which costed around 6500 INR. Plug & play setup, without damaging warranty. You have to cut a hole in the dust cap to pass the cables to and from the ballast. Dust cap is available for under Rs 200 a pair. Gen 2 Osram HID kit is available now, with enhanced output. This has considerably improved low beam output with fantastic visibility, a sharp cutoff and all weather colour temperature of 4200 kelvin, which is warm white. Have plans to go for a quad-bixenon projector setup later. But if you want to keep things stock, the HID kit from Osram is adequate enough to increase light output from the stock projector, much more than what you get from a halogen bulb.

Yes - I have experienced the same when I had this Osram kit in my Nexon too. I think that is primarily due to the bulbs already being of a lower wattage. At 35W, the power consumption is significantly lower. Of course - HIDs and Halogens is not an apple to apple comparison. But still - the lower power consumption certainly results in lower temperature overall.

1675, smileline , 17:33 ,BHPian,"Hello everyone I had a issue with my Brezza since last 15days, wherein every time I encountered a speed breaker or a pothole, my driver seat backrest would make a strange noise (like a tok). The issue had increased lately. I reported the issue during my 3rd free service which was scheduled last week. Luckily the service centre acknowledged the issue after multiple test rides, but were unable to pinpoint the cause. I was again called after a couple of days for diagnosis by the service centre, wherein a third party seat expert was supposed to evaluate the seat. The so called expert removed the stitching of the seat cover and inserted some foam padding between the metal springs, but that too didnt help. Subsequently the body shop technician was called and told to check the seat, he tightened some bolts and after multiple test rides, acknowledged the issue with the seat backrest. Incidentally he also acknowledged play in the seat base. Finally the service centre agreed to change my driver seat backrest under warranty. Luckily I didnt install any aftermarket seat covers, otherwise they would have blamed the installation and not honour any warranty claim. My Brezza is October 2019 make, with 8500km on the odometer. Wanted to know if anyone else had any issues with the Brezza seat, apart from the ergonomics mentioned here, and can only seat backrest be changed, without changing the seat base ?

The purchase experience and how I ended up choosing the Vitara Brezza over the Venue, then seltos and then the Creta 2020 was a long tell in itself. But that is now for some other time as one week in and I have already been through an horrifying ordeal at the ASC. Imagine the horror I felt when cleaning the vehicle on Dussehra 25.10.20 to find tyre bulges on all tyre sidewalls (including the spare wheel) with vehicle run for 250 km. As it was holiday, took the vehicle to ASC next day, where upon checking other vehicles with and without similar MRF Wanderer tyres no other vehicles were having the same issue. The problems started after the workshop manager flatly refused to acknowledge any issue, saying its a normal characteristic and that ""all MRF tyres have bulges on the side walls where the joints are located"". Had to call up Maruti Service manager Mr Akhil Mahajan from Mumbai Office who again repeated what the workshop manager insisted. I finally received an acknowledgement on paper that indeed some undulations have been observed, only after I contacted Mr Sanjay Wali, CEO Sai Service, with Mr Yusuf informing me that he has lost his patience with me. This went on till 20:00 hrs so you all can only imagine the stress I had to face. My only issue is why they are so reluctant to acknowledge an issue in a brand new vehicle? and how could they so callously provide defective tyres to me without any care for the safety of my family? Because surely this should have been seen during PDI. I went against family and friends wishes when going for a premium maruti because I was warned of the neglect towards safety by Maruti, though after reading posts here I felt it would be a safe bet. But I think customer apathy is ingrained at Maruti and has lead to this criminal act of them selling me the vehicle with defective tyres.

Most of the roads are in excellent condition. 5% of the roads end up testing the ground clearance of the Brezza - which manages what is thrown at it with aplomb. The Brezza did not give any trouble at all - we started with the odometer at 39027 and returned home at 42137 running on original Apollo Alnac 4G tyres. Overall fuel efficiency was about 21 kmpl. It was just me and my friend traveling so we drove on an average for 5 hours each day or a total of 10 hours on the road - feeling no fatigue what so ever. We drove safely between 80-100 kmph as road conditions permitted. Fastag is accepted in most toll plazas on NH routes, and many of them have Fastag only lanes which help you save time.

1707, nishp , 14:54 ,BHPian,"5+ years with Vitara Brezza (80K and going) In April 2021, my Brezza completed 5 years and ~80 thousand kilometers of mostly trouble free ownership. This is my first car, which makes it even more special. Initial search for a car Deciding upon a car when you have zero knowledge about automobiles is difficult. My only criteria was how the car looked. Almost finalized newly launched Ford Figo in Jan 2016, but then I saw some pics of Brezza while randomly surfing the web, so decided to wait a little. Brezza was showcased at Feb 2016 AutoExpo and the dual tone Red/Black was the deal for me. The choice was only because of looks, did not even consider if I need diesel or petrol (Brezza was diesel only that time). Booking Went for booking in last week of March 2016 and the salesperson offered me a test drive without asking. After a short drive, he spent next 15 minutes explaining the features. I would have booked anyway. Finally settled for white color although initially I liked Red/black. Then came the shocker, he said that waiting period is 4 months at least!! With a heavy heart I paid the booking amount and the wait started. The surprise call On 12th April 2016 I got a call from some other person in dealership that a White Zdi+ is available due a cancelled booking and if I am interested then it can be delivered to me the very next day. Of course, I decided to grab it instead of waiting for 4 months. The first look of my Brezza at showroom. Did a simple PDI and everything was found to be ok apart from a small scratch at one door which was hard to find. Quickly completed the banking formalities. It took another couple of days for bank to process my request and finally the car came home on 16th April 2016. Sales person showed me all the available accessory packs, I politely said no to everything and opted for extended warranty instead. All in all a very fast and good purchasing experience. Ownership Saga Couple of weeks after purchase, went to 3M for underbody protection: Complete waste of time and money that was. First trip with the car: Apollo boots were very delicate, 3 of them suffered with multiple punctures on sidewall and had to be discarded within 20K. Replaced them with Michelin and then Yokohama Earth. I was an early adopter of Fastag back in 2016. It was a great feeling going through empty fastag lanes back then. Installed ""Yi DashCam"" in 2016 (visible just behind fastag). It is still running fine. Replaced it with Viofo A119Pro/V3 couple of years later. One fine day, a small stone from truck ahead hit windshield and left this mark. It was not obstructing the view but cant un-see it. Decided not to replace windshield and go for DIY repair instead : Good enough results. The leftover marks went away after some time. The candle like tail-lights are invisible in North India fog. I will replace them with current gen tail-lights: I was one of the initial customers of XenonPlanet's micro fogs (Bi-Xenon): No, they are not blinding oncoming traffic. The cutoff is too low: XenonPlanet were very professional back then and I had no complains. They replaced things under warranty too. External TPMS. It is a must have now a days. Bought it from AliExpress in 2017. They worked well for 3 years. Now I am using similar product from Amazon. Matches the color of alloys Internal unit. This is how uneven (and high) air pressure is filled by petrol pump guy. Double checked it with another gauge same results. Now I use my own portable air pump and never visited petrol pump for air filling in last 4 years. The first accident. Someone hit through fender/headlight/bumper while parked. Got it repaired under insurance. Back to original. Key battery replaced after 2 years: Oil leak spotted. It was due to clogged intercooler. A cleanup was done and leak was gone and never reoccurred till now. The famous Maruti sticky steering problem happened. It was replaced under extended warranty: Updated headlights with Bi-xenon projectors this year. Overall I have no major complains and the car is going strong. I hate the fact that its going to be scrapped after 10 years due to scrapping policy in NCR. Will I advise buying Brezza in 2021? Yes. But there are some better option available now if you are ready ignore the service network reach of Maruti.

When questioned, we were told that it's quite normal for Maruti as once the truck reaches Blore outer, they will drive the vehicle from Blore outer to Maruti yard for PDI and then loaded again into a truck which will bring the car to Chennai. When the truck reaches Chennai outer, they will drive the car from Poonamale (place in Chennai) to Arumbakkam for dealer's PDI. Later the car is brought to ABT showroom in Guindy. They claim every car will have min 80-150 kms on the odo. Not sure how far is this true? Well, I don't think we have a choice now as the car has reached the dealer 5 months after booking. If we opt for another car, this might delay friend's car ownership by another 4-5 months. Still, I want to know if it's a normal thing in Chennai for Maruti. Please confirm.

The best way to confirm would be to check other cars at the same dealership and look at their odo. If all have similar figures, they may be speaking the truth.

Why would a truck unload a car for Chennai at Bangalore and then again get it reloaded in a truck to Chennai? Why would PDI be done twice? Is it the same dealership across the 2 states? Sounds fishy.

I drove from Noida to Bangalore when I moved to this beautiful Silicon City and have covered Ooty, Kodaikanal and a few more nearby destinations and have not faced any issues in terms of power, braking or suspension. You might need to use the manual mode while coming down to make sure it doesn't get into higher gears and makes it difficult for you to slow down on hair pin bends. About Ladakh trip - I covered Ladakh,Pangong Lake and Nubra Valley in 2016 in my (old version) Ford Figo and it went pretty smooth other than power loss in a few places because there wasn't adequate oxygen for the man or the machine.
