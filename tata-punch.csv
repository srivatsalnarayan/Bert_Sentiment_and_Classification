0, Omkar , 09:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Tata Punch Review Tata Punch Pros • Snazzy styling! We love the mini-Harrier face and tight rear end • Well-designed & practical cabin with enough space for 4 adults • 366-liter boot is accommodating • 1.2L NA petrol offers good driveability in the city. Performance is acceptable <90 kmph • Sorted road manners & reassuring high speed stability • Enjoyable Harman 6-speaker ICE. One of the better systems in this segment • Features such as auto headlamps & wipers, cruise control, Traction Pro (AMT), cooled glovebox…with factory customization packs too • A full 5-stars in the GNCAP! Safety package includes dual airbags, CSC, brake sway control, ISOFIX etc. Tata Punch Cons • 1.2L NA petrol’s highway performance is weak. At 100 kmph & up, more noise than action • Suspension has a firm tune (R16 variants). It is compliant & liveable, but you do feel bad roads • Jerky and slow AMT gearbox when competitors offer you smoother CVTs and torque converters • 3-cylinder petrol cannot match the competition’s 4-cylinders in refinement & NVH • No turbo petrol or diesel option. Period. Rivals & other Tata cars offer both • Cabin width makes 4 adults welcome, not 5 • Some missing goodies such as an auto-dimming IRVM, splitting rear seat, rear AC vents, full-size spare… • Tata's after-sales service quality is a hit or miss. Remains a gamble This review has been jointly compiled with Aditya & GTO. Thanks to them for the expert observations & photography! Introduction Crossovers of all sizes are hot in the market & Tata's product onslaught is in full-on aggressive mode. Tata already has the Nexon (which a lot of people love) in the Compact SUV segment and now, it has brought in the Punch which, with its 1.2L 3-cylinder NA motor, will sit just below the Nexon in the company's product portfolio. Tata isn’t the first manufacturer to try its hand in the sub-compact crossover segment. Last year, we saw the entry of the Nissan Magnite and Renault Kiger in this space and they’ve managed to attract thousands of customers each month. Because this is a price-sensitive segment, an attractive price tag is a must for Tata Motors to land a knockout punch (pun intended). While the naturally-aspirated engine will play a part in keeping the car's price low, here’s some food for thought - Tata is trying to protect the Nexon way too much. First, it gave the Altroz the same turbo-petrol engine in a lower state of tune and now, the Punch doesn’t get the 1.2L turbo-petrol to differentiate the Nexon from this car. That is really not cool. As GTO never fails to mention, if you don’t cannibalise yourself, someone else will gladly do it for you. The Punch and Altroz are super important cars and Tata is doing them a disservice by not powering them with the full spec turbo-petrol engine, which it has ready in-house. We can tell you that the biggest con of the Punch is that 1.2L NA engine & performance over 80 - 90 km/h. Sucks that Tata has the ammunition ready, but won't take it out of the arsenal. At the very least, the 1.2L Turbo can be offered as an option on the higher variants?! We hope this comes soon, as Tata did with the Altroz which was also originally launched with just the 1.2L NA motor. Lessons must be taken from the Koreans who offer all possible engines + gearboxes at launch, leaving the final choice to the most important fellow (i.e. you, the customer). Exterior Design & Styling The design team at Tata Motors has been churning out some great looking cars over the past few years and the Punch isn’t any different. Having been first unveiled at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show as the H2X Concept SUV and then showcased at the 2020 Auto Expo, the Punch had created quite a buzz in the car community. Now that the production version has been revealed, a lot of similarities can be drawn with the concept. One of the first things GTO, Aditya and I agreed on was that the Punch looks sexy! Models like these prove that you don't need to spend big money to have style. The mini-Harrier face turned quite a few heads on our test drive and brought in some enquiries too. GTO loves the tight rear with those smaller-than-usual tail lights. Using Tata’s Impact 2.0 design philosophy, the car features smooth body curves all over with some sharp lighting elements. Overall, the design is appealing and feels well rounded off. Some notable features on the outside include 16"" diamond-cut alloy wheels, projector headlamps, LED DRLs, LED tail-lamps, chunky roof rails and a black / white roof. The paint shade on our test car is called Tropical Mist. Tata has a wide colour palette for the Punch and other shades include Tornado Blue, Calypso Red, Meteor Bronze, Atomic Orange, Daytona Grey And Orcus White. Build Quality, Fit & Finish The Tata Punch is based on the ALFA-ARC (Agile Light Flexible Advanced) platform that also underpins the Altroz. This platform uses more than 40% high strength steel and since the Altroz has been awarded a 5-star Global NCAP safety rating, we expect the Punch to perform well too. Its kerb weight is close to the Altroz @ 1,000 - 1,035 kg and that shows in the build quality. The front doors have a fair amount of weight to them (rear doors are noticeably lighter though) while the bonnet feels heavy. The car feels solid, unlike some of the tinny competition. That said, we did notice several inconsistencies in panel gaps. Our orange test car had a noticeable difference even within the same panel gap, from top to bottom (between the door & fender). Disappointing to see this. On the other hand, we liked the Punch's paint quality. Wheels & Tyres The top-end variants are offered with 16"" diamond-cut funky alloy wheels that are shod with 195/60 section Apollo Alnac 4G tyres. The lower variants are offered with 185/70 R15 tyres. The 195s work just fine with the 1.2L NA, but if and when Tata introduces a turbo-petrol version (which they definitely should), we'd love to see 205s on that faster variant. The spare is a 185/70 R15 steel wheel, while the PSI rating is 32 (you can drop it to 30 just in the city to make the ride cushier). Ground Clearance The Punch has an unladen ground clearance rating of 190 mm and a laden rating of 165 mm, which is sufficient for the worst of Indian roads. The firm suspension ensures it won't sag. In more of its ""SUV"" marketing spiel, Tata provides this additional data = 20.3° approach angle, 37.6° departure angle and 22.2° ramp over angle. Standard & Extended Warranty Warranty details haven’t been revealed yet, but Tata offers the Altroz with a standard warranty of 2 years / 75,000 km, which can be extended to 5 years / 1,25,000 km. We can assume that the Punch will get similar coverage. That said, because the Punch uses an existing platform, a 1.2L NA engine that has sold lakhs of copies and (presumably) a common electrical architecture, we are hoping that the Punch has fewer niggles than what we see on freshly launched Tatas (e.g. Harrier & Safari). Safety The Punch is equipped with a good number of safety features like dual airbags, ABS with EBD and Corner Safety Control, ISOFIX anchor points, driver & co-driver seatbelt reminders, tyre puncture repair kit and ""brake sway control"" that detects the tendency of instability during abrupt braking before the ABS kicks in to avoid vehicle swaying from the driving path. Besides, the AMT versions come with a Traction-Pro mode, which reduces the odds of the car getting stranded in situations where one of the wheels is stuck in mud or low traction surfaces. However, notable safety features such as ESP and TPMS are not provided in the kit. As mentioned earlier, because the Punch has the same platform as the 5-star rated Altroz, we expect it to perform well in the GNCAP crash tests. Interior Cabin Design & Quality Step inside and the designer's taste & style continue to impress. The minimalist look of the dashboard is something that a lot of people will appreciate. You get a dual-tone black and white theme for the cabin, with the major areas covered in black. The Altroz steering looks good, the air vents on the dash are funky and we sure like the clean, minimalist look of the center fascia. It looks very uncluttered and clean. The crash pad is finished in ivory white with nice tri-arrow detailing, while the textured dark grey panel running across the dash looks classy. There are no soft-touch plastics here, which is not a surprise. But we wish Tata would’ve at least given some fabric inserts on the doorpad armrest area as the Tigor gets. Here, it is hard plastic. Interior quality is satisfactory for the lower half of the cabin; the dashboard, door panels, gear shifter, Altroz steering and air vents all feel satisfactory. The chunky door handles are nice too. But if you look at the upper half / roof level of the cabin, there’s a lot that leaves to be desired. The roof liner feels budget grade (Tiago and Tigor get a premium-looking roof liner) and there’s excessive play on the cabin light's button. We also noticed an inconsistent glaring gap where the roof liner ends and the plastic panel of the A-pillar starts. The sunvisors feel too basic and if you look at the rear grab handles, the finish of the bag hook is rough. Put your hands inside the door pockets & you'll encounter sharp, unfinished edges. At first glance, you will be fine with the cabin quality, but BHPians who look closely will see inconsistencies, especially in the not-so-obvious areas. Space & Comfort The taller seating & 90-degree opening doors make ingress / egress easy. The cabin has enough space for 4 adults (not 5). The fabric seats are comfortable. Their cushioning is on point for daily driving as well as highway cruising, while the side bolstering will keep you in place on twisty roads. Driving Position & Ergonomics The Punch allows you to sit tall. Not only do you have a clean view of the road ahead, but you will also be able to see the bonnet (many drivers like that). While the front and side visibility for the driver are fine, the rear visibility is typical of modern cars. You’ll need the camera while reversing. The C-pillars are quite thick and they lead to big blind spots so be careful in that area. The steering can be adjusted for height and so too can the driver's seat, which means finding your perfect driving position is easy. The steering adjustment lever however is stiff and not lady-friendly at all. The basic important controls - steering mounted buttons, stalks, gear lever are all within easy access. We’ll say that the ergonomics are sorted in this car. Cabin Storage Tata claims there are 25 utility spaces in the cabin and we don’t doubt them. You won’t be left looking for a slot to park your stuff in here. The center console has a deep storage box ahead of the gear lever, where you get a USB slot along with a 12V power outlet. Then, just below the gear lever, you have another square-ish storage space with a 12V socket and two cupholders. However, these cupholders aren’t of the average size as GTO’s regular coffee bottle kept tipping over (has happened in other Tatas too...only Tatas). The glovebox is well-sized, has a separate tablet / laptop compartment as well as cooling + illumination. Special mention of the unusually deep cubby hole on the RHS of the dashboard which is perfect for dumping loose change. The door pockets can hold 1-liter bottles along with other knick-knacks. The front doorpads even get umbrella holders. Rear passengers get seatback pockets to keep their stuff & door pockets. However, cup holders at the rear are missing. Air-Conditioning Like most other Tata cars, the Punch's air-conditioner is damn powerful. It kept the cabin cold when we wanted, and cool when we wanted. Even after parking the Punch under the hot sun, it chilled up the cabin soon enough. No rear air-con vents which does make a difference to temperature equalization, but because this is a small car + the AC is so powerful, we doubt anyone will miss the rear vents. Features Unique & Noteworthy Features Competition like the Magnite and Kiger have an exhaustive list of features, including stuff like wireless charging & 360-degree cameras. While the Punch misses out on some of those features, it still packs all or most of the kit that makes it to the ""necessary"" list. Some noteworthy features include cruise control, projector headlamps, LED DRLs, cornering lights, LED tail-lamps, instrument cluster with 7"" colour TFT display, drive modes, tyre puncture kit, cooled & illuminated glovebox, puddle lamps, auto headlamps and rain-sensing wipers. Owners will miss some goodies like an auto-dimming IRVM, a driver armrest, 60:40 splitting rear seat etc. The AMT-equipped cars get a ‘TractionPro Mode’ which is essentially a poor man's traction control. In situations where one of the front wheels gets stuck in mud or similar low traction surface, this mode gets activated and the system applies the brake on the specific wheel with no traction, with power going to the wheel with grip to get you out of the sticky situation. More on this later. Audio System & Sound Quality The Accomplished and Creative variants of the Punch get a 7"" Harman touchscreen head-unit with 4 speakers and 2 tweeters. You get the usual connectivity options including Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, although these are not wireless like the Magnite or Kiger. In terms of usability, the touchscreen is alright. It’s not super responsive when tasked, but doesn’t have excessive lag either. The Harman system provides good sound quality (by segment standards) once you set up the equalizer properly. It has good bass, good treble - far better than the OEM rubbish we see in so many cars. Punch owners won't see the need to upgrade anything in the after-market. The only complaint we have is that, in one of the test cars, the audio volume didn't go as high as we'd like in Android Auto mode. Switching to Bluetooth solved the problem. The lower Adventure variant gets a 4"" head-unit with 4 speakers. Rear Passengers Rear Seat Comfort & Space The super-wide 90-degree opening doors along with the tall ride height helps in easy ingress & egress. There’s a fair amount of space on offer. Aditya at 5’10” was able to easily sit with the front seat adjusted to my driving position (I’m 5’10” as well). However, two six-footers one behind the other might be a bit tight - they might fit in, but just about. Headroom is ample. The cabin's width is limited and is good for two fit adults along with a child. But three healthy adults at the rear is impossible. In terms of seating, the backrest is on the upright side, although it’s not uncomfortable at all. GTO & Aditya were both satisfied with the rear seat's back support as well as thigh support. The headrests have two positions = all the way up or down. Even those of medium height will need to put it up as it'll otherwise poke into your nape area. The center armrest is wide enough & positioned at an ideal height. No quarter glass like the Sonet, so if you sit back, you will feel that the glass area & your view of the world outside is restricted. There are no AC vents at the rear, nor has any 12V charging port been provided. Boot Space The Punch has a 366 liter boot. That’s impressive when you compare it against some of the other cars in the Compact-SUV segment like the Nexon (350L), Vitara Brezza (328L), Ford EcoSport (352L), Hyundai Venue (350L) and Nissan Magnite (336L). However, the Kia Sonet (392L) and Renault Kiger (405L) have larger boots than the Punch. The rear seats miss out on 60:40 split backrests though. You get two bag hooks (1 kg capacity) and a boot lamp.", 9th October 2021,tata-punch,Mumbai,"1,737","21,011"
1, Omkar , 09:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Driving the Tata Punch 1.2L Petrol MT The petrol is a 1,199cc, 3-cylinder, 12V DOHC, all-aluminium motor, which churns out 85 BHP (@ 6,000 rpm) and 113 Nm torque (@ 3,300 rpm). Let us be upfront in stating that this 1.2L NA is the weakest link in the package. It just fails to ""pack a punch"" above 80 - 90 km/h (city performance is acceptable, however). We’d mentioned it with the Altroz and it holds true for the Punch as well. Tata has royally goofed up in this department by offering just the 1.2L NA. Sure, it should be sold for the price-sensitive customers and sedate drivers, but at least as an option on the higher variants, the 1.2L turbo variant should be offered? It'll be good for Punch customers as well as for the company (fatter profit margins). Tata has said that the turbo-petrol will come if the market responds accordingly, which doesn’t make any sense. The Punch should’ve had the turbo-petrol ready from day 1. When you have the ammunition in-house, why not use it??!! We hope, like the Altroz, the Punch also eventually sees the 1.2L turbo under its hood. Else, Tata stands to lose a lot of customers who have a fatter wallet & want superior open-road performance. Start driving and you’ll notice that the power on tap is ""adequate"" for city usage. The talking point is its driveability, not power. There is enough low end poke & that makes the motor practical for the city. 2nd gear over a speed-breaker is no sweat at all. You can easily potter around in 3rd gear at 40 km/h with the engine revving at ~1,750 rpm. Make no mistake = it has enough torque to carry you around town with few gear changes, albeit in a relaxed manner. You won't find the need to rev the Revotron hard as long as your driving style is sedate. GTO found the outright performance to be acceptable under 80 km/h. However, if you need to quickly close a gap in traffic, you’ll have to drop a gear or two. Not really enjoyable as the engine gets noisy (with that classic 3-cylinder thrum too) and progress can be slow! Overall, the car is a practical point A->B commuter, but it is no scorcher at all. Highway performance is sub-par. At ~100 km/h and above, there is a whole lot of noise, yet no corresponding increase in the speedometer. On the open road, you'll need to work the engine hard to get any kind of pep out of it. Problem is, there isn't much ""go"" even when you do, hence we suggest you move out of the fast lane and stick to the middle ones. The pull up to 80 km/h is still acceptable, up to 100 km/h is strictly average, but post that, it drops off. The engine starts losing steam beyond 5,000 rpm and it gets loud too. Mid-range performance on the highway is not satisfactory. If you want to overtake a vehicle doing 80-100 km/h, it’s going to require planning and you’re going to have to work the gear + accelerator hard. You will definitely miss the turbo on the open road, and with a full load of passengers on mountain roads. With 4 onboard, performance will be even more ordinary. Again, we suggest driving the 1.2L NA variant calmly in the middle lane. Compared to the butter-smooth 1.2s of Hyundai & gang, the Punch's engine sounds harsh at high revs. If you insist, it will go past 6,000 rpm. In terms of cruisability, because of the weak motor, Tata couldn’t give it gearing that’s too tall. You can see that in the cruising revs. 100 km/h is seen at ~3,000 rpm, while 120 km/h is seen at ~3,500 rpm (both of which are on the busier side). Not a gearbox you'll brag about, not a gearbox you'll complain about. The Punch uses the same TA65 gearbox (also seen in the Indica eV2) as the Altroz, Tiago and Tigor. The 5-speed manual gearbox's throws aren't long and the shifter's operation is light and pleasant to use, although it isn’t Hyundai or VW-like slick yet. There is some notchiness to it. Its gates are well-defined though and we had no trouble slotting into the gear we wanted to engage. What you will appreciate is the clutch, which is very light and has a short travel range. It is a boon in bumper-to-bumper traffic conditions. There's even a wide, extremely usable dead pedal to rest your foot. Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH) Being a 3-cylinder engine, there’s cabin-shake when you start the car. Leave the door open and you'll see it mildly vibrating. Even on the move, you will always be aware that it’s a 3-cylinder engine. NVH is just average at low revs; the 3-cylinder sound and mild vibrations are a constant, even when driving calmly in the city. As the engine warms up, these vibes on touch points like the steering wheel & gear lever reduce, but they remain present in other areas (e.g. on the pedals, floor and ORVMs). While engine NVH is still tolerable in the city and you’ll get used to it, on the highway, it starts getting loud + coarse above 4,500 rpm. At 5,000 rpm, not only is the motor really loud, but you can also feel 3-cylinder vibrations on the dead pedal! Wind noise is controlled at 100 km/h. Road and tyre noise are on the higher side. Even at 80-90 km/h, road and tyre noise are audible and above 100 km/h, they are a constant. Mileage & Fuel Economy While Tata hasn’t revealed the fuel economy figures yet, we expect the Punch's FE to be comparable to the Altroz which has the same engine and a similar kerb weight. Eco Mode is available for those sensitive to FE and the good news is, it's useable in the city with no major drop in driveability. An idling start/stop system (which switches off the engine when it's idling to save fuel) has been provided if km/l is your thing. Driving the Tata Punch 1.2L Petrol AMT While the Punch MT is still fine for sedate urban commuters (those on a budget and <80 - 90 km/h), we cannot recommend the Punch AMT. Those who have never driven an automatic before will find it more liveable, but the Punch AMT simply cannot be compared to the butter-smooth Nissan Magnite or Renault Kiger CVTs, nor to the Hyundai AMTs, which use electric actuators. We’ll give Tata's AMT an overall rating of 6/10. It does offer you the convenience of an automatic at an economical price and with decent fuel efficiency. However, the AMT is extremely jerky in heavy traffic conditions. The AMT does end up confused, which definitely won't be appreciated by enthusiasts. Main advantages of the AMT are cost (to Tata & the customer), fuel economy & that it can strapped onto any MT, making it an easy solution for manufacturers. Lift your foot off the brake pedal and the car creeps forward at an indicated speed of 10 km/h, although it feels slower than that (more like 6 - 7 km/h). In bumper to bumper traffic, you’ll find the AMT to be jerky for sure. The car moves quickly when you release the brakes & the brake pedal itself is edgy, so when you brake again (in dense traffic), it's an annoying experience. It's almost impossible to drive the AMT smoothly in bumper-to-bumper conditions. GTO enabled Eco Mode in heavy traffic just to dull the throttle response a bit and make the AMT experience smoother. You should do that too. The AMT feels better in flowing traffic at moderate speeds. Things are more acceptable in the 30 - 50 km/h commuting range than continuous 0 - 10 km/h. In terms of response times, the AMT will disappoint you if you suddenly punch the accelerator to close a gap. Response time is slow and you’ll be left wanting for more. And yes, that infamous ""AMT head nod"" is very much there. On the highway, the AMT is more tolerable. Higher speeds, higher gears & less shifts make the AMT smoother on long distance journeys, but in the city (where you need an AT the most), we didn't like this AMT at all. Kickdown response times at highway speeds aren’t great, so it’s better to plan your overtakes beforehand. We recommend shifting to manual mode for overtaking on the highway. Tata seriously needs to develop or borrow a proper automatic for use in the Punch, Altroz, Nexon, Tiago etc. For the Harrier and Safari, they borrowed a gearbox from Hyundai, which worked out really well. They need to do that for their mass market models as well - develop or borrow! These cars deserve a superior AT solution. Suspension Ride Comfort The Punch comes with a McPherson strut suspension at the front and a twist beam suspension with coil springs at the rear. The suspension tune is definitely on the firmer side here. Just like the Nexon, Tata has prioritized road manners over ride comfort. While the suspension is compliant enough, you are always aware of what kind of surface you are travelling on. The Punch can handle smaller bumps alright, but the bigger or sharper ones come in strong. All in all, you can live with the ride quality, but it’s not what we would call ‘plush’ at all. Cars like the Honda WR-V offer a far softer ride. The 16"" rims shod with 195/60 section tyres also contribute to the stiffer ride. Lower variants with the 185/70 R15 tyres will have a better ride due to taller tyre sidewalls. Further, the recommended tyre pressure is 32 PSI; you can drop it to 30 PSI only within the city. The good thing about such a suspension tune is that it doesn’t bounce around at 80-100 km/h. For a small crossover, it rides pretty nicely on the highway @ 100 km/h. Handling & Dynamics Suffice to say, the Punch has sorted road manners. Straight line stability is satisfactory and the car doesn’t feel nervous even at 120 km/h. Carry some speed around a long corner and the Punch holds its line well. Body roll is well-controlled for a car of this segment & the Punch moves well through the curves. What you will immediately notice when pushing the car hard is that the suspension setup & chassis can handle more than the 1.2L NA petrol has to offer. When is that turbo-petrol variant coming, Tata? Even the 195/60 R16 Apollo Alnac 4G tyres had no issue keeping up with us. Steering The electric power steering is light in the city and a lot of owners will appreciate that. Combined with the compact dimensions & taller seating, the Punch was easy to maneuver around Bombay. While Tata Motors hasn’t officially revealed the turning circle figure, engineers we spoke to confirmed that it’s just under 10 meters (turning radius = <5m). The steering does weigh up adequately as you gain speed on the expressway. However, one thing GTO noticed while coming down hard on the Lonavala Ghat was the steering weight being inconsistent through the corners. Sometimes it felt a little light, and sometimes it felt a little weighted. The weight & feel are both inconsistent. Further, the steering isn't particularly sharp or precise. Turning at speed feels like you’re moving it through clay! Frankly, this feels more like a Mahindra-tuned steering. Of course, the mass market won’t even know what we’re talking about, but for enthusiasts, it’s quite a boring EPS. Braking The Punch is equipped with disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear. The brakes perform as expected. You also get cornering stability control = Tata says ""CSC supports / stabilizes the vehicle during partial braking in curves by reducing pressure at the required inner wheel. This helps to reduce the probability of vehicle oversteer during cornering + braking"". Niggles & Problems Since the Tata Punch uses a lot of components that have been in the market for a while (i.e. 1.2 NA engine and gearbox), is built on an existing platform, has loads of part sharing with other Tatas & presumably deploys an existing electronics architecture, we are hopeful it doesn’t have the kind of niggles we’ve seen other Tata owners (example, Harrier / Safari) suffer with. That being said, you should buy the extended warranty without a speck of doubt.", 9th October 2021,tata-punch,Mumbai,"1,737","21,011"
2, Omkar , 09:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Tata Punch Exterior Images Mini-Harrier look makes the Punch look very handsome. Slim DRLs with a piano black grille at the top looks sleek: Rear has a nice and sharp look. Still very concept car-like, but somehow manages to work well. GTO especially likes the tight design with these smaller-than-usual tail lamps: Distinct creases & bulges on the sides give the car character. Excessive black body cladding lends the Punch a rugged look and makes it appear tall: The Punch measures 3,827 mm in length, 1,945 mm in width (1,742 mm without mirrors) and 1,615 mm in height; has a wheelbase of 2,445 mm which is smaller than the Altroz (2,501 mm): Flared wheel arches and sharp body lines make the Punch look muscular. Overall build quality is satisfactory, but we found panel gaps in some of the other test cars to be very inconsistent: LED DRL strip sits at the top along with the turn indicator. Halogen projector headlamp cluster is placed below. The projectors act as low beams and the bulb next to it is for the high beam. Headlamps get automatic and follow-me-home functions: Look closely next to the headlamp and you’ll notice this opening called an ""air curtain"" to improve aerodynamics. Nice one, Tata: The piano black radiator grille gets a chrome border at the bottom and carries the Tata badge. The tri-arrow design slot on one side looks unique and premium. It has the horn placed just behind it. Not a fully open radiator grille. Looks unique, we love it! Unusually tall black cladding on the lower bumper. Air dam is split by the number plate and gets large tri-arrow detailing: Round halogen foglamps double up as cornering lights: Under the front bumper, you have a wind deflector, and mud flaps just ahead of the front tyres: Shockingly, no underbody protection at all! The exhaust pipe is quite exposed along with the oil sump: Bonnet gets raised edges & some muscle on the side for an aggressive look: Bonnet is heavy and gets an insulation sheet underneath. Doesn't help as the engine is very noisy: Glossy black ORVMs get integrated turn indicators. Creative variant gets auto-folding ORVMs: Overall glass area is sufficient to let enough light in the cabin, but rear occupants will miss a quarter glass. Blackened pillars look good. C-pillar is very thick: Jacking points have been marked on the running board: Very stylish door handles! Only the driver's door gets a request sensor + keyhole: Black panel on the C-pillar has a scooped-out section from where you can access the door handle. The concealed design takes some time to get used to: Funky alloy wheel design! 16"" diamond cut alloys are shod with 195/60 R16 Apollo Alnac 4G tyres. Note the squarish design of the wheel arches: Drum brakes at the rear. The short rear overhang also results in a good departure angle of 37.6 degrees: Both, front and rear wheel wells get partial cladding - one of the reasons why road noise creeps into the cabin even at 80 to 90 kmph: Clear markings on the inside of the fuel flap + cap to show this crossover runs on petrol. Fuel tank capacity = 37 liters: Long, thin antenna sits at the front. On such a handsome car, Tata should have fitted a short stubby or shark-fin antenna instead of this outdated design: To add to the muscular look, the Punch gets these stylish + chunky roof rails finished in shiny black. These look and feel sturdy, unlike the ones on some other cars: The roof extends into a spoiler that houses the HMSL: Rear windshield has a rhino marking at the bottom. We have seen such animal-themed markings on recent Tata models: Sweeeeet LED tail-lamp clusters have a unique and futuristic design. Notice the tri-arrow design of the pilot lamp and the intricate detailing including… …this amazingly integrated ‘Tata’ lettering on the sides: Reverse camera placed just below the Tata badge: Spaced out ‘P U N C H’ badging on the tailgate. Lower bumper has multiple design elements including units that house reflectors at both ends and tri-arrow detailing. You get aero vents on the sides and a skid plate-like design at the bottom. There’s also space for what could house a rear foglamp in the middle. Just love the design! Exhaust pipe is nicely concealed behind the bumper on the RHS: Here’s a look at the car in the Atomic Orange paint shade (our first choice)… …Meteor Brown… …and Tornado Blue: ", 9th October 2021,tata-punch,Mumbai,"1,737","21,011"
3, Omkar , 09:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Tata Punch Interior Images Love the design of this dashboard. It’s simple, minimalistic and looks classy. Ergonomically, all controls easily fall to hand: Tall windscreen offers good frontal visibility. Many drivers will appreciate the fact that the bonnet is visible from the driver’s seat: Leather-wrapped, flat-bottom steering wheel with dark silver inserts is superbly thick and has a fantastic design too. The steering is lovely to hold and comes with contours for your thumbs: Buttons for the infotainment system, telephony and voice commands are placed on the left spoke. A useful mute function has been provided (long press to mute). Notice the small horn symbol (next to steering buttons on both sides). Press that for the nice-sounding horn! The center part of the horn is on the firmer side. Most drivers will find themselves using the sides. Cruise control and MID buttons are placed on the right: Thick stalks feel durable. Auto headlamps and rain-sensing wipers work like a charm. A lane change indicator is present. Headlamp leveller is smartly placed on the stalk itself. Like in other Tatas, the DRLs can be turned OFF / ON by moving the light switch to the parking lamp position & back to the off position, twice in quick succession: The engine start-stop button has been placed on the driver’s right-hand side. Yes, it is illuminated and has a silver ring around it. Next to it, you will find the buttons for the drive mode (Eco and City) along with the front fog lamp switch and the idling start / stop button (MT only). Just below the buttons, there’s a fairly deep cubby hole. The base is slightly lowered to hold coins / loose items: Steering is adjustable for height. The adjustment lever on our test car was quite firm: The instrument cluster consists of an analogue speedometer, a 7"" TFT screen with a digital tachometer and a MID. The digital area has excellent quality graphics! The entire cluster should have been a size or two bigger though. Many of you will find it small (we've noticed this in other Tata cars too). The digital tachometer looks cool, but the exact rpm level is rather difficult to read on the go. A digital engine temperature gauge has been provided at the base: MID displays all the standard information as well like - two trip meters with average fuel consumption + driving time + average speed (individual readings for each trip meter), instant fuel economy (graphical bar), distance to empty, time & outside temperature. In the AMT variant, you are told to press the brake pedal to start the engine. Current gear position is displayed in the tachometer. Below that you get the display for City or Eco mode: Display for the cruise control is nice. You also get warnings if any the doors or the tailgate has been left open and to align the steering wheel when you switch off the engine. You can also keep the ‘Power’ and ‘Torque’ display on the MID while driving enthusiastically. For the IT geeks, you get the open-source software component information. The auto start-stop notification is also displayed on the MID: Squarish silver air vents look classy. Tata said that the cars that will reach the showroom will have body-coloured air vents on specific body colours: Bonnet release isn't perfectly positioned in the dash cutout. However, it is robust and feels long-lasting. Notice the lower edge of the dashboard. It is sharp and could have been finished better: 32 psi is the recommended tyre pressure for the 16"" rim variants. Can be lowered to 30 psi for a cushier ride: The 90-degree opening door carries the black and white theme. Since the lower part is black it won’t get soiled that easily: Chunky door handles feel very premium. Nope, that’s not a tweeter next to it: Driver's window gets one-touch-down convenience. Red light on the 'window lock button' appears when all passenger windows are unlocked. Should have been the other way around. Press the rotary ORVM knob down to fold the ORVMs in, press it down again to open them: AMT instructions have been stuck on the doorpad: Comfy front seats offer satisfactory support (both - lateral as well as under-thigh) for a person of a medium build and height. Larger users might find them a bit tight though. The adjustable headrests are soft. The seat compound is just right, we feel, for combined city and highway usage: Tri-arrow design pattern makes its way on the seat fabric as well: Only Accomplished and Creative variants get a height-adjustable driver seat: Pedals are well spaced out and it's good to see a well-sized dead pedal too. Unlike what we see in most budget cars, it also has good width and is set at a very comfortable angle: A look at the pedals of the AMT variant: Budget fuel release flap on the floor: Tweeters are placed on the A-pillars: ORVMs are well-sized and offer a good view of the action at the rear: The view through the IRVM is just average. It’s mainly restricted by the headrests and the thick C-pillars. No automatic dimming for the IRVM. Manual day / night flick switch is provided: Rearward visibility is restricted by the thick C-pillars and the headrests: The center fascia looks quite simple and uncluttered. The silver trim around the gear lever looks quite nice: Accomplished and Creative variants get a Harman-developed 7"" floating touchscreen head-unit. It features a high-resolution display, voice recognition, the usual music inputs (USB, Bluetooth, iPod), image & video playback (via USB when the car is parked), on-screen SMS display & readout, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity, voice alerts and a reversing camera display: You get the usual audio presets to play around with for the sound system and you can also check the driving performance in terms of efficiency on the touchscreen. You also have quick access menus from left and right for AC controls and other operations: The Punch comes with What 3 Words navigation. In this, each 3m square in the world has been assigned a unique 3 word address. You can either type in these words or use voice commands to set a particular destination on the navigation system (Google Maps via Android Auto / Apple CarPlay): The iRA app lets you remotely lock / unlock the car, operate the headlights + horn and check the DTE. It also gives you a diagnostic report with critical alerts and a list of Tata Motors service stations in the area. Other functions include find my car, stolen vehicle tracking, remote immobilisation, emergency SMS, geo fencing, time fencing alert, valet mode, roadside assistance, share location, social tribes, trip details and driving score: Switches for the climate control system. Any changes to the climate control settings are shown on the infotainment screen. The air-con is powerful. Even on a hot day, it chills the cabin in seconds. The blower is always audible - you can hear it even on level one. While it is tolerable till level two, it starts getting loud on levels three and up: USB port and 12V power socket are located at the base of the center fascia, but no Aux-in port has been provided. Below is a storage bin for a smartphone: Typical Tata leather gear shifter that we’ve seen in their recent cars. It gets a leather boot and silver insert: AMT gear lever is pretty basic but gets a nice piano black console. The leather wrapping makes it feel a bit more premium: Bird's eye view of the center console. Handbrake is strangely on the passenger's side, as if in a left-hand-drive vehicle! Tri-arrow detailing on the white pad on the dashboard looks lovely: On top of that you have a dark grey wood-like finish which also looks very premium: The glovebox is big and has a partition on top to hold a tablet / book. It also gets a pen holder and cooling and illumination: Rhino design inside the glovebox: Only one cabin light has been provided and it has been placed in the front. The rear passengers will be left in dark. The button and the light feel ordinary too: Just look at the play on the button: Tata really needs to up their game in terms of fit and finish. There are multiple places where the plastic ends have sharp edges which you don't see in competitors' products: Sunvisors are economy-grade in design & feel. Passenger side unit gets a vanity mirror, while driver side unit merely gets a flap to hold tickets: More with the economy-grade roof liner. Cheaper cars like the Tiago and the Tigor get a very premium looking roof liner: Smartkey is identical to other Tata cars. It is nicely finished and feels premium. Headlights can be activated by pressing a button on the smart key (to help you find your way in the dark). The shiny black border looks tasteful: ", 9th October 2021,tata-punch,Mumbai,"1,737","21,011"
4, Omkar , 09:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Rear doors of the Punch open and close in a triple-stage action as well (rear doors usually open in a dual-stage action). They feel noticeably lighter than the front doors, which feel more hefty and swing out at a 90-degree angle - just look at this image! Downside? Try shutting the door after being seated - it's a task! The tall seating does make it easy to get in and out of the seats: Just like the front, the rear door pads are finished in black with a white insert on the armrest: There’s enough legroom for two average sized adults to sit behind each other: Seatbacks are scooped out to liberate more kneeroom. Two adequately deep and wide seatback pockets are provided. These are the best to dump in miscellaneous items (even your house keys so they don't cause rattles & aren't easy to find): Backseat is surprisingly comfortable for the size of the car. You have good overall support and can even tuck your feet under the front seats comfortably. Headroom is plenty. A quarter glass would’ve improved the view out of the window for the rear passengers: Side occupants get three-point seatbelts and soft, adjustable headrests, while the middle passenger has to make do with a lap belt and no headrest. Rear seats are equipped with ISOFIX child seat anchors: Center armrest is soft and it’s at a comfortable height and wide. Two hands fit easily. There is no hard plastic here because there are no cup holders: The headrests can be either in a full up or full down position. When in the up position, the headrests almost touch the roof liner. Most people will have it in the up position as in the down position, the base pricks the spine: No rear AC vents here. Instead, you get this storage area that can act as a smartphone holder too: Spring-loaded grab handles have been provided above all the passenger doors. Both the rear units have nifty coat / bag hooks, but they are poorly finished and have sharp edges: Just like in the Altroz, the floor hump is wide, but not high at all. Don't know why Tata is bragging about a ""flat floor"" in its marketing material when it's clearly not the case: Parcel tray comes with a recessed area and raised border to keep things from rolling onto the rear seat: Boot space of 366 liters is more than many of its competitors. The loading lip is high though which means you will have to lift your luggage a little higher while loading: Tools are neatly arranged in a Styrofoam casing in the spare wheel which is a 15"" steel rim. It’s shod with 185/70 R15 Apollo Alnac 4G tyre: Like other recent Tata cars, you get a portable puncture repair kit: Baggage hooks with 1 kg capacity on both sides of the boot. The boot lamp is on the left side: You can fold down the seatback to increase the boot space. No 60:40 split here: Tailgate is cladded on the inside. You also get a useful grab handle to pull down the tailgate: On the other side, the area under the boot lip looks ghastly and should’ve been covered up properly: ", 9th October 2021,tata-punch,Mumbai,"1,737","21,011"
5, Omkar , 09:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Off-Road Experience Tata had arranged a course to showcase that the Punch can go through some of the usual set of off-road obstacles. This included steep inclines and declines along with steep side inclinations as well. The course also included articulation and water wading along with driving through a little slush and rock crawling in the end. The Punch cleared all the obstacles with ease as these were very basic obstacles meant to showcase the 20.3°approach angle, 37.6° departure angle, 22.2° ramp over angle (unladen), 190mm of ground clearance and the 370 mm Water wading capability. Note that the Punch is not a hardcore off-roader, but will do better than most of the hatchbacks. Another highlight of this course was the ice challenge that was designed to demonstrate the Traction Pro mode in the AMT variant. The course simulated a situation where you would lose traction on one of the front wheels when stuck. When this happens, the touchscreen displays a message asking if you would like to use the Traction Pro mode. Upon selecting Yes, the touchscreen will ask you to press the brake pedal with your left foot and slowly accelerate with your right foot. You will feel the brake is applied on the right wheel and the wheel with more traction gets some of the power to get the vehicle out of the sticky situation. Technically, this system is an affordable solution to traction control where if you start losing traction, the system applies brakes. Here, the brake force is directed towards only one wheel that allows the other wheel to rotate. This system has been patented by Tata Motors and is a nice addition to the Punch.

6, GTO , 09:00 ,Team-BHP Support," I am very impressed with Tata's R&D and new product capability (unlike complacent Maruti (Maruti sleeping at the wheel | Where are the new car launches? | Why is Maruti missing new trends?)). Enjoyed driving the Punch. This car will easily add another couple of thousand sales to Tata's monthly tally & make it a strong 30,000 cars / month company. Reasonably solid build, great styling outside & inside (I love that dashboard design), sorted road manners, feels very ""fresh"" and will win over customers in the showroom. Ride is firm though on bad roads in the city - broken tarmac will bother you. The Punch will win many fans. Hope it is priced well (most Tata cars are). Main deal breaker is that 1.2 NA engine. Fine in the city, slow on the highway, poor NVH. I can't figure out why Tata won't use the ammunition it has ready in the house (the 1.2L Turbo). They should also give it the diesel. End of the day, let the customer choose. See how the Koreans come all guns blazing with an unbelievable number of engines & gearboxes (more recently, XUV700 also offered a wide buffet). And yes, Tata desperately needs a proper AT for its mainstream cars. This AMT is very sad in heavy traffic conditions. It drove me up the wall! Happy to see such impressive new cars from homegrown players . This, the Altroz...the XUV700 - just see the kind of response these Indian cars are getting (XUV700 has crossed 50,000 bookings!).", 9th October 2021,tata-punch,Bombay,"70,236","298,017"
7, CEF_Beasts , 09:19 ,Distinguished - BHPian,Excellent and detailed review I really liked the design of the car and the mini-Harrier package that it offers. Only grouse will be the 1.2L NA engine! Had it been offered with the better engine this car would have been the perfect package for buyers in this segment. And this is another car on which all colours look brilliant!, 9th October 2021,tata-punch,Mumbai,"2,710","17,762"
8, Sebring , 09:24 ,Senior - BHPian,"Great review there. I feel Tata has delivered an impactful punch in the segment. This all-rounder should garner good sales for the fast rising Company. Tata Motors are slowly closing in on Maruti/Hyundai in terms of product range, and the numbers should support that. The front design looks like a shrunk version of Harrier and I felt this could work against the premium Brand. Rest of the features are 'win-win'. Look forward to the 'Black' and 'Camo' editions of this pocket wonder", 9th October 2021,tata-punch,Dubai/Bengaluru,"3,521","10,982"
9, DevSunit , 09:48 ,BHPian,"Good to see Tata emerging as a frontline company in our automobile sector. Punch will be a great city car and it has some more low end torque than Altroz's 1.2 NA. As a Nexon owner, I am satisfied with my TASS here and In Kerala, many TASSs are also growing their reputation. IMHO the white panel below the Infotainment screen looks plain and they should have added a badging like PUNCH just as they did in the case of Nexon- 2021 models. Now Tata should concentrate more on the QC Department and Service associates to reduce the horror stories about them. Also they should develop a good NA 4 cylinder engine and source a good TC or CVT box to add in their cars. A Creta - rivalling SUV and a good sedan (revive Magna ) would be a good addition to the stable. Personally, I Would prefer the Altroz here though for its more soothening interiors and for the space and looks better too IMO. But it is a nice car for a person who is going to phase small rough patches of tarmac in his daily drive.", 9th October 2021,tata-punch,Kayamkulam,39,78
10, GLAD73 , 09:51 ,BHPian,"Definitely among the more sorted Tata cars at launch. While the engine may not win over enthusiasts , it will suffice for most people. If the Punch is priced competitively it should have no problem outselling the Magnite and Kriger. Now Tata has to improve their sales and service experience to seriously challenge Hyundai for the number 2 slot in sales.", 9th October 2021,tata-punch,Panaji,53,91
11, mark4nano , 09:54 ,Newbie,Excellent review as always. Crisp yet covering all the essential content for an informed car buying decision. The Punch is going to be a great buy especially if used mostly in the urban jungle. Hopefully niggles should be limited since a lot of parts have been shared with other cars from the Tata stable.

13, Axe77 , 10:20 ,Team-BHP Support,"I have mixed feelings about this car from the very quick speed read of this review and some other videos. The primary disappointment to me in the budget end of Tata cars are their underwhelming engines. As I see it, neither the manual nor the AMT of this car are anything to write home about. Given that its rough / off - road credentials are being touted so much, making it a capable car on the highway (from an engine standpoint) should have been a priority. There is a LOT that Tata is getting right with its offerings (on the product side, I am not on sales / service / dealer management etc).

16, ashis89 , 10:32 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"One of the most anticipated car launches of the year and well deserving too. With a good launch price, this should be a hit among the youth. Tata should seriously think of adding the ex-Tiago yellow too, to the Punch palette.

18, RavenAvi , 10:35 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"The Punch has the potential to be a revolutionary game-changer for Tata, if priced correctly. It ticks a lot of boxes for the paying urban customer - looks that stand out from the crowd, classy interiors, new-age platform, tried and tested competent engine, and an automatic option. Not to mention, the feel-good factor which comes with a ""SUV"" purchase these days, however ""mini"" it might be. This is a fast growing segment which the KUV100 and the Ignis could not crack, and the Punch has the best chance of doing so. I am sure the 1.2L I-Turbo petrol will join it's lineup in the days to come, in the higher-end variants. The diesel option is being mulled over too (a test mule with the same tune as the Altroz's diesel is present), but nothing finalised yet. Petrol sales in this price range are off the roof these days, so don't be surprised if the plans for a possible diesel option are eventually dropped. I really hope Tata provides enough after-sales service support to the Punch's paying customers. Their record in this department in recent times has been a real hit-and-miss. They should realise that this is the most important feel-good factor in owning a car these days, and they need to tighten up in this department. There's nothing more impactful than word-by-mouth publicity, more so when it is coming from your paying customer! Fantastic review, guys.

19, GTO , 10:36 ,Team-BHP Support," Quote: Originally Posted by GLAD73 While the engine may not win over enthusiasts , it will suffice for most people See, that's my point. Why offer just one? Why not ALL engines, and let the customer choose? The 1.2L NA can very well be offered on the Punch for those sensitive to cost & who are okay with its ordinary performance. Even the Octavia was sold with a 1.4L petrol & the last gen Creta too had smaller engines. But why not ALSO offer the 1.2 Turbo & 1.5L Diesel for customers who want it? When you have the engines ready, it really is inexplicable to not offer the same at launch. Sell the Punch with THREE engine options. Offering more engines expands the market for the car. With this 1.2L NA being the sole offering, Tata is going to lose many customers who want better power & refinement. If Dominos sold just a peppy paneer pizza, it wouldn't be as successful as it is today. Tata eventually offered both the better engines in the Altroz.

20, ads11 , 10:40 ,BHPian,"Overall a very promising product as pointed out but can't help but after with GTO and others, just why oh why would you handicap your new car by not offering a more spirited engine?! I'm pro choice at most things in life, and I feel OEM product planners need to realise that you're not really doing yourself a favour by limiting the internal choice customers have within your stable. I know the cannibalisation issue has been convered ad infinitum here, and for good reason I might add, what baffles me is why Tata Motors management seem to refuse to heed this advice. Very good point about the need to just source a solid CVT automatic from someone if not developed in house. Like the fit and finish, all this adds up to the overall feeling of polish to the whole experience with this car. Tata could've really thrown the cat amongst the pigeons by offering a BEV option, high price or not, would've created so much buzz (but then again Altroz is another that's been waiting to have an EV version). Hope Tata price it well. This is a striking looking addition to the market that will certainly bolster their sales target. On a final note, from the rear three quarters I just realised why the tail lights look familiar. Is it me or do they remind you of the Mazda MX-30 BEV? At a much smaller scale the Punch emulates the profile of the Mazda, which is no bad thing considering how handsome modern Mazda's are. It's remarkable how the Harrier esque face of the Punch at first glance gives it the presence of a much bigger car (from photos at least).", 9th October 2021,tata-punch,Leeds,925,"2,239"

I expect the Tata Punch to start with a Rs 5.29 lakh or 5.39 lakh pricetag for the entry-level version. The car has been built to attract buyers who would have otherwise gone for a Wagon-R, Santro or even a Swift.

Better to be cannibalized by one's own products than an outside brand. They can also strike a balance between the two. Like, they can keep the diesel exclusive to the Nexon.

They did it with the Altroz. They will do the same with the punch. Let me tell what else they might do, that they already did with altroz 1. Add some features to the XZ+ variant - like one touch up too for the driver side window (now it gets one touch down only), better looking flat wipers, leatherette seats, express cool button etc 2. Delete some features from the actual VFM XZ variant - like the rear fog lamp, TFT instrument cluster, IRA etc Altroz did not get IRA and leatherette seats when our official review was published. They silently did that later. Same will happen to punch. Offering better engines later is a sly way of increasing the prices significantly, while their launch makes an impression that they have priced it at a great value. Giving 1.2 N/A at a mouth watering base price can attract customers into the dealership. Altroz is being marketed as a ""starts from 5.5 lakhs ex showroom"" car. But the top trim diesel exceeds 11 lakhs on road today. That is 200% increment over their base sticker price on ads.

42, SenPai_GTi , 13:12 ,BHPian,"That's a neatly compiled review of the punch. The design is phenomenal, as always with their new design language. I just have one issue, the interior of the base variant. If the pricing becomes competitive with the tall boy hatches(Wagon-r/Santro), many would consider shifting here. Tata not offering speakers or even a slot for a simple 1-din radio is beyond my understanding. Even my 2013 Nano CX had two front speakers and the radio slot. My dealer happily added the aftermarket 1-din Pioneer system for me. Now Tata has the additional ""Rhythm"" pack (costs 20-25k on the Altroz) gives 4 speakers, a 3.5"" floating screen (which I agree looks better than the old 1 dins, but costly) and steering mounted controls (seems logical and convenient, but not sure how useful in this segment). Not sure how the additional cost is going to justify for a simple audio system, considering the segment (where even 10k matters a lot while deciding on accessories). Otherwise, its worth noting how Tata has maintained that stance and those proportions with regards to its competition. Looks beautiful even in the base variant. The gradually narrowing side windows and high position wraparound taillight assembly makes it even more SUVish. Hyundai Casper (not yet launched): Its all about how the rear profile has been carried out. This can easily be mistaken as a Tall boy hatch (cannot blame anyone for this due to its smaller dimensions). Mahindra KUV100 NXT: Well, I don't want to say anything here except that its a tad bit smaller than the Punch. Suzuki Ignis: Yes similar dimensions as the KUV 100nxt, but instead of going butch and overly SUVish, the company decided to go with the neutral look(which made it proportional and pleasing to look at from the front, can't say the same for the rear). But it still has a resemblance to its cousin, the Wagon-r. Maruti Suzuki Espresso: This design has seriously grown on me, love the looks of the grey shade with the aftermarket cladding. But it seems as if it is a segment below the punch. (Is there a segment below this ?) Suzuki Jimny (not yet launched): Ah yes, the thing that we've been waiting for. Come on Suzuki, give it to us already!! It is a no nonsense off roader in 4X4 variant, hence the design language speaks a lot differently than any other vehicle in this segment. Overall, I feel that this is a very good proposition for anyone who is wishing to get the wagon-r CNG and drive the hell out of it on highways (the wagon-r CNG cannot reach 3-digit speeds but is still used by many for highway commutes everyday). With the petrol costs increasing day by day, I would just downgrade to the Punch, plonk in a CNG and be happy for the rest 10-15 years (if the car permits).", 9th October 2021,tata-punch,Pune,46,203

48, rajneeesh , 13:52 ,Senior - BHPian,"Tata Motors is on a roll and they seem to be working on implementing their strategy. They seem to have been focusing on a) Design and b) Safety to differentiate their vehicles from that of the market leaders. They know that their petrol engines are not as refined or powerful as that of Maruti & Hyundai. They also seem to realise that as log as the engines are fuel efficient and reliable, the average Indian car buyer is not going to complain too much as long as the price is right. A Tata vehicle today looks far better than any other product in its class. Marutis look drab in comparison. Many people will buy the Punch ( as they bought the Harrier) just because it looks so much better than its competitors. Tata has introduced the Turbo petrol in 1.2 Altroz. But from what I see on the roads, the 1.2 NA Petrol still outsells the Turbo by a country mile. One reason is that the Turbo is more expensive. At that kind of a price, a large segment of Indians opt for a Hyundai which is still seen by most, as a more desirable brand. Tata keeps trying to attract his segment by talking about safety, an area where he Koreans and Maruti have lagged behind. Tata Motors is still a loss making company and they have to use their resources very carefully. They will keep making their products better ( engines and transmissions) to close the gap on competition, even as they have improved tremendously in terms of design, interior finish and safety . When I bought my Safari Storme a little over 6 years back, most people questioned my decision ( and some my sanity) for investing 16 lakhs in a Tata vehicle. That seems to have changed. I hope that Tata Moors keeps upping its game as the Indian Car buyer needs wider choice.

A sizeable portion of its sales, that has turned this company around, comes from this 1.2 NA engine and that AMT. By keeping the turbo away at launch, it is possible they can go in for aggressive pricing, and when the competition heats up, introduce a higher variant with the turbo petrol and other features.

A customer looking for a decent city car with occasional highway trips or even regular highway trips in states like Kerala( can't call most highways in Kerala as highways ) can definitely consider this car and won't be complaining about the naturally aspirated engine. I have seen a fan following for Tata cars in Kerala especially the Nexon, Altroz etc. and the Altroz beats Baleno and i20 in monthly sales in Kerala, so we can definitely expect similar demand for Punch too. The Punch doesn't have a direct competitor I would say and it has created a new segment, hope it would sell more than 4k each month. Its true that Tata should have provided a turbo petrol variant but considering the price difference between Altroz XZ plus iTurbo and Nexon XZ plus being less, I don't find a reason why one should opt a Punch over a similarly priced Nexon.

While I agree Tata should have given the Turbo petrol option right from the outset, I don't think the engine bay is probably big enough for Tata to plonk the 1.5 diesel mill.

71, Kuldeep31 , 22:46 ,BHPian,"Excellent and to the point review as usual. What really took the cake this time is how fast it came up. I frankly was not expecting the review on Punch today and so T-Bhp reviews are now instantaneous too. Apart from that somewhat odd-looking rear (extra plastics) and of course the pedestrian engine, I could not find any deal breakers here. Knowing Tata over the past half-decade, there was little possibility that they would offer the turbo version at the debut. So by the time the turbo version is launched, we all are pretty sure of that, some of the features may well be offered (centre armrest, rear AC vents, underbody protection) with a better tuning of the EPS. With that turbo, Punch stands in position to trigger a new segment that the Ecosport did way back in 2013. That is the time frame I am eyeing for our new steed and Punch will be a serious contender. Just came to my mind how stark the differences are when compared to the giant of the industry. While Punch may well be that first sub 10 lakh compact “SUV” which many in the market were looking for Maruti is happy fiddling with their ever-changing marketing vocabulary. Although competition is always welcome, the way Tata et al. is approaching almost every segment south of 25 lakhs, do we really have to care about Maruti now?

Would loved to have the diesel in this but considering the Altroz's petrol:diesel sales ratio, can't blame Tata. Though to be frank, their usual excuse of 'Will do so if the market demands' is getting annoying. Well no one demanded an estate or 3 door SUV, yet you gave them. No one demanded the Sumo or Safari. No one demanded the Indigo CS. The Indica Vista at one point had Five different engine options. Also the mass market didn't exactly demand safe cars. You started entirely new segments. Just be frank and declare you have suspended ICE development and is going to jump straight into EVs. Not excited for the Punch now, nor the future turbo petrol variant. Not expecting a diesel variant to come. The Punch that am excited for is the PUNCH EV ~10 lakhs OTR.

79, mercedised , 11:19 ,Senior - BHPian,"First of all thanks for the great review. Before I come to what I feel about Tata Punch, I must give a insight as to why I have come to this conclusion. I have owned Tata's right from 1991 Sierra, 2003 Safari, 2004 Safari, 2006 Safari, 2012 Aria, 1999 Indica, 2006 Indigo Marina, Indica Dicor, Tata Nano 2011, 2009 Indica Vista (TDI), 2009 Indica Vista (Quadrajet), Indica NA (2007). All of these cars had two major distinct USP's which differentiated Tata from the competition. Those were SPACE & RIDE COMFORT. They were the reason I bought Tata's. I preferred Space and Ride Comfort over reliability and engine power (needless to say all of them except Aria felt under powered). Even now I own a Indica Vista and it diminishes potholes like no other hatch back of current generations can do. I can say that as I also own Swift which has stiffer suspension. Safari was a great looker, Vista was fine for its generation even Aria was not bad. Coming back to 2021, All I see are great looking Tata's and in the process of making them fine lookers they have undone everything else that was their USP. The current gen Tata's apart from safety ratings are AVERAGE IN SPACE, HAVE UNINSPIRING ENGINES & RUBBERY GEARBOXES, STIFFER SUSPENSION (I don't know why with the kind of engines they are providing, this suspension setup does'nt make any sense). I donot like what they have done with their cars in respect of the things mentioned above and there is not a single car except Hexa (discontinued) which I would buy if I had to put my money. I am very sad to say that they are not learning anything from competition and are rather than just copying what is working for others in the market. All of their current gen cars appear to be the product of ""What work for others will work for them"" mindset. This will take them no where, as it appears that they donot know what they are actually doing. I on the other hand am seriously happy with what Mahindra has learned. They have come great way and are not simply betting on the market trends, instead they are creating new trends. Tata Punch looks like another unfinished\hasty product attempt by Tata. The uninspiring engine which is dud, stiffer suspension, less space, same old gearbox in the generation of MATLAB and other simulation softwares where you can pre-simulate almost everything. The connection to the brand is missing.

80, Reinhard , 12:02 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Usual excellent review of a very interesting car. Rated it 5 stars of course. I have been seeing the HBX/Punch since months now near my home & I always felt a bit ""short"" when driving alongside in my Nexon. The Punch is certainly tall enough to claim the ""SUV"" badge at least. The technical aspects are of course quite good, especially gimmicks like the electronically ""locking"" front drive via head unit control. Smart & simple. However - the real show-stopper for me - is the visible step forward in interior design, fit, finish & small aspects. For example - the proper cut-outs with plastic cladding for the ISOFIX anchor points in the rear seats. Both Altroz & Punch have this. Nexon is still crude. One has to ""find"" that anchor. Its these little items that actually make a big (but unnoticed) mark in the daily usage of a car. Good to see that each ""next"" car from TaMo has some learnings put into design decisions. Good days. I for one will not once complain about that 1.2Revotron. Ram-air or not. Its more than enough for regular usage as a ""all rounder hatchback"" engine. Noisier than the K12 on the outside yes, but good enough in the cabin. Enough power and torque to get the job done. The part of the country where I stay - the roads are dangerous even at 50KMPH. So no real use requirement of a very fast engine to be honest. Safety first - and leaked information seems to show that the Punch will get 5 stars. Anything above 4 is fantastic. The Punch sure packs one - punch! Has at least so far shown that it has the guts to take on the WagonR, Swift and even some sub4M SUVs. Honestly - put a diesel engine in that engine-bay & the Punch can even knock-out the Nexon. I'll have my eyes open for the Punch EV eagerly. This might well be my first EV (the potential spot is currently occupied by the Altroz EV, but Punch has far more practicality associated with it). Good luck to TML with this exciting product.

If the driver's door is not closed (Stated by another user too in a previous post). 2. Sequence of actions. Brake pedal release must be the last action. For example if you slot into gear and then open the driver door, creep gets disabled even if you close the door. To re-enable the creep, you must press and release the brake pedal once more after closing the door if the vehicle is already in gear. This in my opinion is done as a safety precaution, in case the driver has actually left the car, we don't want the vehicle to move away by mistake. 3. Clutch temperature above safe limits. 4.

Remember Tata still doesn't have a Creta/Seltos rival and the present ALFA platform is flexible enough to be lengthened to more than 4m and be dressed up in a new upper body. As a recap, Tata themselves did not envisage the Nexon would go in to be such a hit product. The Nexon is the last of the models to be built in the old Vista, ( Tata X-1), platform,( which was very soundly engineered and even package protected for Euro NCAP 4-star, because one of the intended markets for Vista was to have been the EU). The Nexon, alongwith the Zest & Bolt, were meant to be more of ""stop-gap"" products before the new platform, (Tata AMP - Advanced Modular Platform, a.k.a ALFA), came in. Over the next few years I expect to see more platform rationalisation ar TML. The next generation Tiago, I'm sure will move to a short wheelbase version of ALFA. At present the Tiago and Tigor are both based on the old INDICA/INDIGO platform, [check out the identical wheelbases & the A,B,C pedal mounting locations in Tiago & Tigor, they even share the old Indica A,B,C pedals ] I may be wrong in my crystal ball gazing efforts, but I feel the Tigor in sub 4m guise will be dropped and a Honda City rivalling sedan, around the 2550-2600mm wheelbase mark will see the light of day. Whether that will carry the Tigor nameplate is in the realms of conjecture, but I feel TML won't lose much brand recognition by dropping the Tigor nameplate. Next logical extension of the ALFA architecture would be an Ertiga competitor, which possibly will see the light of day. The Sierra project has a lot of fans inside TML but the dilemma is whether to base it on ALFA or a shortened Harrier platform, (because the old LR Freelander underpinning the Harrier/Safari supports inclusion of 4x4 hardware), which the ALFA does not, (more tuned to urban oriented products).

105, Reinhard , 12:47 ,Distinguished - BHPian,Just curious - the PUNCH comes with a puncture repair kit. Is that TaMo being generous specifically with this car (for no plausible reason) OR - this might be a car that loses out on the full size spare wheel as part of the 1st refresh within 6 months from launch? Will giving a TPMS and puncture repair kit be cheaper overall in bulk production? I suspect yes if they can continue sourcing Chinese internal TPMS components. The government after all has removed the mandate for a spare wheel in small cars. Its a matter of who bites the bullet first (Ford bit it - but then they quit altogether!).

Based on anecdotal evidence, I have seen Engine + GB combo being one of the lower priority items after Looks, Features, Delivery time, etc. when it comes to decision making for mass market. Although it is frustrating to watch as an enthusiast, it is the reality. Looking from Tata's POV, if your limited variants are significantly covering the mass market/customer segment that you are targeting, why go and confuse the customers with too many options. Not to mention the additional burden it will have on production planning (even after considering the improved planning systems) and subsequently delivery times. And evidently from their recent marketing tricks, Tata knows very well how to keep the customers engaged by filling up these product gaps with intermittent, well-hyped launches.

What I'm more concerned about is the child safety rating, particularly the vehicle-based assessment. It doesn't have a three-point rear centre seat belt which means it'll lose out on that 1.00 point. Then there's the warning labels, ISOFIX markings, CRS compatibility, etc. not to mention the actual dynamic test. If there's something new Tata can bring, it's the first 5 star child occupant protection rating. One thing's clear, they're trying (based on the Tigor EV's 4-star COP score) and I wouldn't be surprised if we do see a five star child safety rating after all. I hope they take care of the excursion of the Q3 dummy and the unlatching of the backrest (something that affected the Altroz) this time around. I'm expecting a wave of 4 and 5 star (adult occupant protection) cars later this month (or maybe some before the end of the year), but I hope I'm not proven wrong by some manufacturers. With other manufacturers taking up the five star challenge and Global NCAP using a thoroughly revised assessment protocol from July next year, Tata has some work to do to maintain its lead. Particularly fitment of ESC and side head protection airbags for adult occupant protection, and fitment of three-point belts for child occupant protection. At present, the latter is just a 1.00 point modifier. From next year, the vehicle loses all points for the vehicle-based assessment if they're not present.

117, karan561 , 23:36 ,Distinguished - BHPian,"Last week I too had the Tata Punch with me for about half a day & here are my Initial Impressions in the form of this VIDEO from the Drive; https://youtu.be/1z_7mOH40sg Likes; - Exterior Design & the Name Punch. - Interior Design & Spaciousness. - High Speed Ride Quality. - Light Weight Platform. Dislikes; - This Engine & the name Punch don't match. - No Diesel Option (Deserves the 1.5L) - Suspension feels Stiff < 60 km/h - Lack of a Conventional A/T. This ""Driver"" focused review focusses on the following; As we all know that before Tata Motors gave this product a name, it was internally codenamed the X445 & had been provisionally named HORNBILL. The X445 codename gives away valid proof that this car is based on the 45X hatchback which is nothing but the Altroz, implying the Punch is based on the ALFA-ARC Platform. The key to this platform is its modularity as this platform is flexible to make different body styles & even does support future EV implementation. Infact this platform was one reason TATA Motors was able to cut down from earlier 6 platforms to only 2 & the other being the OMEGA Arc which underpins the Harrier & SAFARI. In fact the this platform is so flexible and modular it can be compared to VW's MQB platform & in reality during mid 2017, VW was considering building cars using Tata's platform however for some reason that did not work out & VW themselves modified their MQB into MQB A0 IN for the Indian market. Finally, yes this is the ALFA ARC platform previously seen on the ALTROZ which has been modified with Higher GC a Higher Driving Position for the Punch. There are some Good riding cars in this segment & similarly the Punch doesn't disappoint much. Thought the Suspension is a bit still at lower speeds (< 60 km/h) but at higher speeds the Punch feels matured for its size & segment. The wheel size is 16"" (Top Spec/Variant) but the tyre profile is 60 & that cushions more than the Suspension at lower speeds on bad section of the roads. Overall its a continuation of the Notion that the new age TATA cars offer Good Ride quality. This being a high riding Crossover/SUV body style the Handling remains playful enough and does remind me of the ALFA Arc Genetics of the Altroz or may be its the same Steering Wheel. However the not so soft suspension may be helping the Punch handle well. Another contributing factor to good handling (for the segment) may be the less weight (1035 Kgs -Top Spec/Variant). The place where this little TATA lacks a PUNCH is in the Engine department. 1.2L N/A, 3 Cyl. The Power outputs are not worth mentioning. Instead its important to note the drivability remains favourable in city limits & the low RPM pick up is good. It definitely sounds like a 3 cyl. too. I drove the Manual variant only & unsurprisingly the old & trusted TA65 gearbox is used which has satisfactory shifts supported by a light short range Clutch. For anyone who has been in the new age TATA cars this cabin will be familiar to them. Right from the instrument cluster to the dashboard layout. The driving position as i said has been emphasised to be upright for the SUV experience and increased visibility. Also the Infotainment system is of the right size in my opinion and not unnecessarily large. It comes connected with TATA motors latest iRA connected car technology. The Rear Seat feels decently spacious (including the headroom) for the segment. 5th passenger will get an almost flat floor but 5 Heavy / Large passengers will not only make the space a struggle but also the engine Scuffle. Miscellaneous Observations & Thoughts; - Fun to extract Power from a non Powerful motor. - Commanding Driving Position & Good visibility all around. - ALFA-ARC platform was initially called the AMP (Advanced Modular Platform). - I personally dislike the half digital instrument cluster, particularly the rev counter. - Ground Clearance for the Punch is 187 mm where as the Nexon has a GC of 209 mm. - Ground Clearance is high enough to cross speed breakers in 3rd Gear, if you know what I mean. - I personally dislike this 4 spoke Alloy Wheel Design, but it seems many automakers are adopting the 4 Spoke trend. - Did not get the opportunity to try out the iRA app/features, but I believe the TEAM-BHP review has covered it well in this thread. - Feature list is encouraging (Sunroof fans may have to wait a bit longer till TATA provides one in the future), Harman 6 Speaker Music system sounds good for the segment.

The Safari name plate is probably selling at its highest numbers ever at the moment - while not being a Safari at all, what an irony.

Quote: The brand new 1.2 L DOHC 84 BHP (85 PS @ 6,000 rpms) engine is simply fantastic! This motor is way more refined than the 1.3L in the Swift, has good in-town driveability (113 NM of torque) and, one can tell, a couple of generations newer. It was even fun taking her to 6,000 rpms, the motor is fairly revv happy (though progress is slow and noise levels higher after 5000 odd rpms). The engine is very tractable and boasts a flexible nature; it is at home pottering around in the city or stretching her legs on the open road. This engine is so good that I see it makings it way into the Swift as well (soon?). The gearshift quality is smooth & sure-slotting in the petrol. We owned the Ritz for 7 years before replacing it with an Ignis, which is about 250kg lighter. Believe me, the K12 was fantastic in the Ritz and feels only slightly better in the Ignis. Honestly, unless you don't do a drag race between them, you would hardly feel a difference in daily use (I'm not complaining. The benchmark is really high). On paper figures never tell the complete story. You can have the same power figures, but the way it is delivered matters a lot. My cousin has a Tiago (bought under my advise) and a dear friend has a Tigor. I've clocked more than 3000km combined in both of them. When it comes to performance, the 1 ton+ Ritz would still smoke both the Tiago and Tigor. I'm not talking about 0-100 drags. Just normal in town or highway runs. The K12 is like an all aluminum golden retriever. The Punch has a lot of pros, engine just isn't one of them.", 13th October 2021,tata-punch,Thrissur,183,"2,012"

Well not the case with the Punch (and Altroz etc) - but most of the other manufacturers are moving to an idea where the digital TFT part that shows the Tachometer - is actually dynamic. So the users can select multiple other information items to show in the same real estate. Not just the tachometer. Perhaps thats the reason. (Again - not applicable to the current Tata console - here the tacho stays tacho in the TFT region). That said - I think you make a valid point about how it can be better overall. In fact - I was rather skeptical when Tata moved to the digital consoles in Tiago/Tigor/Nexon. But then - having seen it in person over the last year - I find it actually more useful than my analogue console. For starters - the clear bold speed indicator (like you mentioned) is always properly visible. Whereas, in my case - the steering wheel blocks the analogue dial significantly . Then - the console has quite a bit more information items including coolant temp gauge (missing in my analogue unit sadly), TPMS readouts and what not. So if the manufacturers manage to reach a good layout and information integration in the digital units - it will be great.

139, Amazing , 18:36 ,BHPian,"The Tata Punch has officially been awarded a five-star adult occupant safety rating by Global NCAP. The Punch, which is yet to be launched in India, received a five-star rating for adult occupant safety and a four-star rating for child occupant protection, thanks to its safety features, which include anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brakeforce distribution and dual airbags as standard, even though its does not get electronic stability control (ESC), and manages with a proprietary piece of tech that Tata calls “brake sway control”. This makes the Punch the third product from Tata to receive such a rating after the Nexon and the Altroz. Tata's other recent offering, the Tigor EV, received an overall four-star rating. Global NCAP, which is a not-for-profit organisation registered in the UK, independently assesses safety levels in production cars. Its test parameters exceed the minimum crash test standards set by the United Nations. Its primary aim is to “support new car assessment programmes in emerging markets by offering technical support guidance and quality assurance”, says the organisation. The Tata Punch, which the brand classifies as India's first subcompact SUV (and has the credentials to prove it) is going up against the likes of the Maruti Suzuki Ignis and the Mahindra KUV100. The Ignis has only received a three-star safety rating, while the KUV100 has not been rated by any new car safety assessment programmes (NCAPS) except India's Bharat New Vehicle Safety Assessment Program where it received an overall five-star safety rating. According to the Global NCAP website's news forum, the base variant of the Punch was put through the crash test. Fitted with two airbags, ABS brakes and ISOFIX anchorages— the latter is the international standard for attachment points for child safety seats in passenger cars. The statement by GlobalNCAP also said the safety levels can be improved by equipping the model with ESC as standard, along with standard side impact protection systems. This is primarily to encourage brands like Tata to incorporate such safety systems as Global NCAP's standards are going to become more stringent in 2022. For cars to get similar results, they will have to have these features as standard. For the moment, all variants of the Punch will not receive ESC, primarily to keep the ownership costs low. The Punch, scheduled for a launch on October 18, does not have a price tag yet. The group also stated that “Tata's decision to install both child occupant's as rearward facing, demonstrates that this position offers the best safety option as both child dummies received good protection”. David Ward, President of the Towards Zero Foundation, of which Global NCAP is a part, said “We are obviously delighted with Tata's safety result in this voluntary test. Global NCAP encourages manufacturers to participate in our programme on a voluntary basis to help create a market for safety. It is very satisfying to see leading manufacturers like Tata and Mahindra engage so positively with our #SaferCarsforIndia agenda.

Actually, safety is slowly but surely starting to reflect in sales figures too. Two out of three five-star* cars were in the top ten sellers last month, and all three were in the top twenty.

Also did try reversing on the same parking ramp and surprisingly the car didn't move forward when shifting from brake to accelerator. I know this will never be encountered but i find that in some situations in AMT equipped cars if we encounter a slope while reversing the throttle modulation isn't smooth, i.e either it's too less or too abrupt. But in Punch it was very smooth in transferring the power except for a hint of clutch engagement. This was after doing multiple attempts so should not be an issue in daily usage. Other positives were a chilling AC even at 26 degrees and superb ride quality. The car didn't feel budget in the way it handled rumble strips and sharp speed breakers.

So whatever I am saying here is coming from amateur so experts here please excuse. They had the top level creative AMT inside the showroom and outside for TD too. I have zero experience going to car showrooms before so when I went inside, the Punch looked like a big car to me but outside in parking it becomes ok. We went with mindset of checking Tiago too and obviously Tiago felt small in front of this. Also wife and myself sat on driver seat and as expected, in Tiago, we could not see the bonnet at all while in punch it was clearly visible till end. This inspired confidence in wife. We were considering spresso for this reason. Drive was good and as I told, I have no experience, we felt all was good. My brother told me at signals and such when people honk, more sound comes inside the cabin. He himself drives 2010 corolla Altis and previously he drove 2012 Honda City automatic. My brother did mention the head nod thing when gear changes in AMT but for myself and wife, we just were not sure and felt nothing as we didn't specifically look for it. Back seat has ok recline, obviously my brother's corolla has more incline and more relaxed seating. Wife appreciated the ability to adjust seat height. I believe accomplished variant has it as well. Checked that online since we are considering accomplished and don't think the creative may be worth the extra money, just not sure how much extra. The sales person had no clue of price but they were taking booking for Rs. 21,000 and he was sort of trying to get me part with my money but I did not go with intention of booking today. I plan to do that next weekend once I am aware about prices. Wife liked the mystic blue color and said it was different than usual colors. I personally like it too. That or gray. Don't want to go with the loud colors. Infotainment was nice and sound was good but we didn't make it more loud. Touchscreen response was as expected and no such delay was observed. AC was nice. Brother felt nice driving automatic, his current corolla is manual but previous Honda City was automatic. My brother is 5.9 and myself 5.10 and when I sat behind him, I had generous legroom. In back seat, it was myself, wife and 7 year old and Still we has space. My wife's father owns Hyundai Eon so she told in that it is cramped if we 3 sat. Overall, we liked it and I hope the price is good as this is going to be our first car. Waiting patiently for price reveal so I can see how much it comes to on road price and I decide which variant I want.

The colors on offer are great and it'll turn heads on the road like anyone's business. It's got a tight hatch-backish rear and a mini-Harrier vibe going on in the front The interiors were also really good quality. Fabric seats, plastics, knobs all seemed high quality and fit and finish was real good. I really liked the accented AC vents The gear knob has a really nice gloss black finish - looks classy. The dash is clean and pleasant Rear legroom was also quite nice. Width would be best for 2 though. One thing I found weird was this cutout in front of the horn - won't this get a lot of mud/muck/water/ leaves stuck inside? Overall it's a great package and looks brilliant.

The showroom experience was nothing less than terrible. Sales staff was absolutely uninterested to sell. This did not seem like a showroom that has a brand new product. A lady just took our name and number, which seemed more like a sarkari tick box exercise. No one came forward to talk to us about the car, no one explained the features, no one was bothered. I could see a few other clueless customers too who were looking around for help but the sales staff was either uninterested or busy on calls. Now here's the kicker - I went and asked for a test drive to the lady. She first said we're not doing test drives for the Punch. I stared at her with surprise and pointed out the TD vehicle which just entered their premises as I asked this.

Ideal pricing would have been 6.99 for the Accomplished & 8.09L for the Creative (which was the initial decision by Tata's corporate honchos), so that a fully loaded Creative AMT (60K) with the iRA pack (30K) would have topped off at 8.99L ex-showroom, just for the feel-good factor for the paying customers and to set the cat among the pigeons against the competition. Again, pricing for the top 2 variants were moved upwards a few days back, as per a birdie. And these will be jacked further up come January 1, 2022. Make hay while the sun shines, Tata Motors.

So they probably aren't so worried about Renault/Nissan and instead want to give customers the option of a safe car on the same platform as Altroz but with an AMT and better ground clearance...etc. Things that they might be hearing on the ground.

At 7.5 lakhs I get the smooth and proven 1.2, 4 cylinder mill in the Ignis and a superior sales, service and ownership experience. Suddenly Altroz diesel looks ultra VFM. The top end pricing with turbo petrol would have still been understandable, but that NA 1.2 just doesn't click at that price point on the punch. Frankly speaking, Tata could have just done away the Tigor and slot the Punch in its price bands, or else at least just keep both the products with a price overlap. So now we expect the Punch Turbo AMT top variant, whenever it comes, to cross the 10 lakh mark. Not a good time to get greedy Tata, especially for mid level products(5-10 lakh is the new 3-5 lakh range), you have the premium offerings for fatter margins!

I could buy a Ignis zeta AMT for cheaper than the Punch adventure AMT. I will get double the feature almost the same cabin space and way better refined engine for less. The safety ratings and looks might be the only factors which are better. Then I also have the option to go for Magnite which is a segment above Punch in most parameters. The engine is meh but the torque/power to weight ratios are pretty close to the Punch. I won't lie I am disappointed by the pricing was hoping for lower prices atleast at launch.

The car might look like ignis in size, but it is clearly more spacious that ignis. I am 6'2 and still I could sit behind in the rear seat with driver seat set to my driving position 5. 5* crash rating Negatives 1. Looks ugly at some angles, resembling KUV100 and Spresso silhouette 2. Absolutely dull to drive. It felt even more sluggish than the Tiago. Kiger 1.0 turbo felt superb in comparison. 3. Mediocre fuel efficiency - the MID showed 12 kmpl even after driving pretty sedate for a long time 4. Interior plastics surely feel downgrade to Altroz/Nexon. There are very hard plastics everywhere and some feel outright cheap. Again, Kiger felt better. Example the elbow rest at the rear(who decided to use white there!!) And the grab handle above the front passenger door. Trust me, even Zest's grab handles feel much nicer And a typical old bad habit of Tata, the wiper blade exposed to cabin What's with the open slots on the front grille? Horn shows through it Front doors felt heavier than rear doors. 5. Pricing - Less said the better. If you want ground clearance and AMT, increase your budget and get the nexon, even if it is the base variant. If you want a family car and don't care about GC, get the altroz. Tata, when you demand 10 lakhs for the top trims, why not give a proper armrest, atleast for the driver? This is what I saw in the service area There are so many altrozes and Nexons in the service center. I went to rectify a minor issue with my Safari Storme V400. I am sure the sales people will make many Altroz/Nexon buyers to buy the Punch instead. When you have a lot of footfall, why not use it to sell all products? They clearly do it. One of the sales people even did the ""SUV sir"" justification when I asked about the high prices of Punch. I showed my storme and told him I am done driving SUVs. Lol.

When will this stupid gearbox be done away with. This AMT is going to be a deal breaker for many. Charge another ₹50k or ₹1 lakh and give us at least an option of a TC or CVT! If we look at the sales number break-ups - I'm sure AMT versions of all cars that do offer it - will show sufficient numbers to justify the technology. Being an AMT owner myself (in my city hatch) - I find it absolutely fine as long as I know how it behaves AND I know what my requirements are. Its an improvement over an MT in terms of convenience. Absolutely everything else - is like an MT! People complain a lot about the slow shifts of an AMT - I'd like to see these people shift a lot faster and efficiently than the AMT without damaging the clutch or getting abysmal FE figures. Maybe a few true enthusiasts and experts. How many real world drivers are like that? If we look at the accidents & traffic discipline of drivers on our roads - they are below average. AMT is just fine. Especially in a market where a car as costly as the Seltos sells with an ""iMT"" - AMT is definitely here to stay & absolutely worth it. What a company wants to charge for anything - is their call. Whether we buy it or not, is ours. For example - I wouldn't say the Punch is priced too high. I'll simply say its optimistic - and its certain that I'd not buy it for the asking price . The real fly in the ointment in case of Tata Motors specifically is - they are giving ONLY AMT in cars below the Harrier. What they need is an option of a CVT and TC in specific cars. A CVT in the Altroz & Punch, a TCAT in the Altroz & Nexon Diesel. Thats what will properly distinguish their product portfolio and justify some of the tags. For example - the ""Premium"" offering Altroz - is the only car in their line-up that has no automatic at all! Thats plain stupid . In fact - had they at least offered an AMT at lower pricing - that car would have sold a lot more. Add a CVT/DCT whatever - when its available. Keep it along-side the AMT. People will choose what they need.", 18th October 2021,tata-punch,Pune,"4,834","17,603"

207, mark4nano , 21:05 ,Newbie,The pricing of the Punch seems optimistic Downside being 2 things mainly 1. Lacklustre engine performance 2. AMT gearbox The 11 lakhs OTR price tag for the Creative AMT is shocking IMO. I assume they are playing their trump card with the Safest car in India tag. Or is this an indication that the Punch is going to fill up the shoes of the Nexon and the Nexon pushed towards the Creta/Seltos bracket. ��, 18th October 2021,tata-punch,"Dubai,Bengaluru",12,16

The interior is quite good and the variants were well balanced. In my 3 year old Ignis the white interior door panels parts are very easy to maintain and still shines like new after a simple wipe with proklear which many feared that will go yellowish . Although I had the budget one of the reason I bought the Ignis ditching the Baleno was the latter's built quality. Ignis is also a tad better here too. I own a Ignis Zeta AMT and a Wagon R Vxi AMT and I love the Ignis except the bouncy suspension. No problems with AMT in both the cars so far.

215, ashokabs , 07:01 ,BHPian,I resonate with the complaint that the Punch higher variants are overpriced. Tata Motors has reached a good position at No. 3 but they need to continue to be more aggressive to pressurise the No.2 Hyundai. The Tiago sold well as it was a lot of car for the price in 2016. That too with an engine that was well suited mostly for city driving. The real profit is to be made in the SUV segment which is the fastest growing. Looks like Tata Motors is getting greedy and are forgetting that market share also makes a huge difference in how the company is perceived by the consumer. Don't think Punch will sell very well. We might see good discounts as now they cannot reduce the price. The only option they have to correct the higher variants price is to plonk the iTurbo 1.2 L engine and not increase the price much!!!, 19th October 2021,tata-punch,New,245,568
216, Emvi , 09:01 ,BHPian,"As surmised earlier, the media hype and the crash test rating have probably emboldened Tata to price the Punch the way they have, especially the higher variants. https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/india...ml#post5164504 (Do initial impressions & market feedback influence the launch price of a car?) Lackadaisical approach of the Tata dealerships won't help matters further. I was at a Tata dealership(sub-dealer) the day Punch was unveiled. While they had no idea about the launch date or the pricing then, which was understandable, what shocked me the most was their approach. Browsing through the Tata Punch website I had discovered this- Given that Altroz comes with a 5-speed MT, I was rather pleasantly surprised. On asking this with a SA, he coolly told me that since the PUNCH is an SUV, they have probably given a 6-speed box to it, Seriously!? Again when I asked the SA if brochures were available, he was left scratching his head and took him a while to take my contact number and I was told that the brochure will be sent to me via Whatsapp. In fact, I had also contacted the main dealership twice prior to my visit, enquiring about the Punch. Two weeks have passed since, forget brochure/pricelist, I haven't been contacted even once! At this juncture, let me also stress on another important point. The dealership in question is the sole dealership in my entire district, need I say anything more? I really want the Punch to suceed and Tata in general. Present day Tata cars sport wonderful designs and Tata along with Mahindra are upping the game bigtime as far safety is concerned, commendable. However, leaving aside new product niggles and reliability issues, with this kind of approach from the dealerships, I really wonder how SAFE is it to buy a Tata car!?", 19th October 2021,tata-punch,KA-21,585,"3,261"

They do not trust Nissan or Renault enough to purchase their vehicles. The budget is around 10L on road for an automatic CSUV. Petrol is the choice of fuel. If the budget is stretched a little, the only cars that fit this criteria are Punch, Nexon, and XUV 300. Now, between Punch Creative AMT iRA, the Nexon XMA AMT S, and the XUV 300 W6 AMT NT, they may well choose the Punch, despite that engine. They are all AMT's. They are all safe (from a crash rating perspective). I understand there are better auto tranny's available in that price range. I'm sure people who are okay with those vehicles may go for them.

But can I afford to pay so much more in the name of an extra star of safety? Punch will find a small market for itself, just for its looks and baby-Harrier design.

Surely, will anyone be willing to spend on the higher variants with this set of engines? The lower variants will not face a problem and I see them getting good numbers from it. Higher variants look a very tough sell and may not find many takers.

There is no car currently which looks as imposing as Punch in its category. This is their trump card and they have played it well. If someone doesn't like top end version of Punch then they have Altroz and Nexon to choose from, which are equally safe and good looking cars too. Which car maker boasts 5 cars (Tiago, Tigor, Punch, Altroz, Nexon) in their portfolio with minimum of 4 star GNCAP safety ratings in the range of 5.00 L - 14.0 L, None. We enthusiast may say anything about the engine but the proof is Altroz, Tiago and Tigor (even small quantities though) are selling around 10000 cars monthly with the same engine (not counting Nexon Turbo here and Altroz iTurbo may contribute to 1-2K units). The engine is not a slouch, I have driven Tigor manual with 3 people on board on the highway and city with AC on, the sweet spot is 3rd gear and the car has ample of torque to overtake and reach 80 KMPH quickly. And it was effortless to cruise between 90-100 KMPH in 5th gear. Yes, not as butter smooth as K12 of Swift. Also, the ride quality of Tigor was pretty stable, no bouncing around. Haven't driven punch but hope the same from it too. Between engine smoothness and safety of life, people are now leaning towards the later and looking for safer cars. TML wont mind adding 5K units/monthly of Punch to it sales figure (may be more of pure and adventure versions).

Bonnet clearly visible. 2. GC is a boon in crater-filled roads. 3. Ride quality is far better than the competition. 4. 5 star rated safety 5. Seats are very comfortable. 6. DynaPro surely works, low end much better than Altroz. Negatives 1. Subpar quality levels, was waiting for prices before penning the review, the price does not complement the quality of plastics that are around. ALtroz is far superior. 2. AMT though on slow speeds you will notice the very little shifting of gears. But once you floor it, it literally dies, it just doesn't know what to do. It starts holding the current gear for longer, leading to more noise than movement. 3. For highway quick overtakes need to be properly planned. 4. Front doors are heavy than the rear. 5. No underbody protection. 6. Altroz trumps the ride and handling department. Conclusion If you are not worried about GC and running is in the city with less traffic get ALTROZ period, it is the best in everything. If you need GC and automatic and budget is around 10 lacks then consider Nexon XM. If you need GC with automatic and tight budget test drive the competion back to back, then decide, my pic would be Kiger with 1.0 turbo CVT. Punch is for those who are on a budget and whole heartedly support vocal for local campaign, doesn't worry about the after sales(I am tensed now seeing the Punch response as service center are very scarse compared to the vehicles TAMO is selling.

They won't put the diesel mill in the Punch, just like how they won't give an AT with the altroz. Now if you have a 10 lakh budget and you want a diesel car, you will buy their altroz.

Moreover a diesel mill in Punch will make it even more grossly overpriced. Why would anyone choose a cheap feeling Punch when they can go for the nexon when you can get both at 12 lakhs OTR.

Rear AC Vents Present in Punch but not in Altroz . 7in TFT Instrument Cluster Looks subjective I had delayed my car purchase for Punch, now I'm confused. May suggest. GO for altroz proven product and I saw a guy at my local dealership who was there to check out the Punch and then zeroed on the altroz which has a better space management and driving dynamics. looks way more premium from inside too. what was I Doing at the dealership? Just went to check the Punch with my dad. Initially he liked the looks Stance GC simple interiors etc. then we sat down with a sales rep we were looking for an AMT in a tight budget. Then the sales rep told my dad the price 8.03 lakhs OTR for 2nd base model.(Adventure AMT) Dad instantly asked me how much does the other car cost, the other car being Ignis which we were finalising before we got to know about Punch. I had literally begged my dad back then to wait for a safer better built option thinking this might be in the same price range as Ignis. (my bad) The decision was made then and there which car we are going to buy atleast for my dad. Though he said that this(Punch) looks way better than Ignis, is safe and quite practical the 1L extra is too much. TBH even I thought to myself I could get 2nd top variant of Ignis and still save 40k and have twice as many features than the Punch. I know there is no price to save a life and Punch ensure at 64km/hr it will save my life. except for maybe the engine Punch is a better car than Ignis and some might feel that the extra cost is worth it. But what went through my mind was if the base model of Punch is 5.49L and the adventure variant is 6.39L which offers a 1. Music system 2. Rear power windows 3. Wheel caps 4. Central locking 5. electrically adjustable ORVM with no auto fold. have a market value of 35k max. how does this cost tata 90k? this time I am not comparing any other car to this but I just cant understand the pricing. To add to this misery Tatas AMT costs 60K which is atleast 15K more than the AGS offered by MS. Tata removed the XM from Tiago. While the XE and XM on altroz have a price difference of 60k with auto folding orvm and mood lighting on top of the above 5. what is the extra 30K for in the Punch? Why am I comparing a hatch with MSUV? because tata have kept the pricing that close to the Altroz. Looks like a clear case of Tata overpricing the product to capture the hype. I am not even a Tata fanboi still i booked pre booked everything just to be let down like this by Tata. The only reason we did not book the Ignis today and cancel the Punch booking was the fact that I told my dad ""converting to electric after a few years would be easy because of the ALFA platform on which the Punch is built"".

For the first, only & family car that you are looking for - the Santro, WagonR and Spresso - are horribly unsafe vehicles I must say. And its an unbiased opinion, I own one of the siblings of these vehicles. Its imparative that you spend a bit more and get a safe car, that you can use for out-station visits / vacations around your place as well. As a first car - there will also be a learning curve, lack of certain judgement that comes only with experience. Its really good if you buy a car that is safe for your family. You stay in Mumbai, so fast roads, visits on highways towards Konkan / Gujrath, visits on the rather risky Pune-Mumbai eWay are going to be on the cards. Don't compromise on safety. If the Punch is going out of your budget - I suggest you buy the Tiago AMT. Its an excellent small family car, does everything one needs from a first car, and some! Solid build, spacious, good kit on offer and the same engine from Punch! And if you want a TallBoy - just realized this from the options you mentioned - please do check out the Ignis. Test it, stretch your budget and get it. Its not GNCAP certified on safety rating though. So its more of a perceived safer car.

Now that we know it is not the case and Tata went all SUV pricing that this closer to Nexon than it is to Altroz, maybe the prospective buyers should opt for the Altroz instead. Apart from the higher GC and no waiting period, the Punch doesn't seem to have a lot going for itself. Altroz, by comparison is a physically larger car in all dimensions and with lower weight, it should be faster as well while being almost as safe. You can also have it in Turbo Petrol / Diesel if you want it to go even faster. Altroz is, in my books, the most well rounded product in this price range and should be looked at instead of the Pulse.

The petrol mills were manufactured independently by Tata at the Sanand plant. At least that's what I believed all along.

Renault and Nissan are not really strong in terms of their sales and service network and seem to be happy selling approx 3000 units per month. Tata will be targeting a much higher number and I will not be surprised if they achieve it. Their success with the Nexon has given them the confidence to aim for big numbers like 10,000 per month.

I came across this video on youtube which compares the three Tata cars which falls under similar price point and can help us to choose the right car for us.

We all know that base variant of a car is always crash tested and awarded safety rating points/stars. Still Tata have managed to price the base variant pretty aggressively!

It's just that the top variants are too expensive for a kind of car it is and the price segment it is competing in. The very reason for which you are applauding Tata (aggresive base variant pricing) could very well have led to higher pricing of top variants. As a business, they must have some margin in mind for Punch. They might be willing to take a hit on margin for base variants to make it attractive, and compensate that with fat margins on higher variants. Ultimately it comes down to the demand vs. price curve they have anticipated/betting on for punch. How close their estimate is with the real demand curve will decide their success now.

Actually I feel the Pure and Adventure variants are priced okay. For example the Punch Pure is worth the 40k extra than the Ignis Sigma. You get a safer car and a newer design overall. I have a feeling this will be a fairly successful model for Tata, more like a baby Nexon. The real issue starts with the higher variants, especially the top of the line.

Yes, the pricing is optimistic for the Creative but at least till the Accomplished variant, the pricing is really good! Magnite is a different game altogether. I feel the only option Nissan had was to price it very aggressively or else they might even be out of the Indian scenario! Magnite is a really good car with an amazing price without a doubt. Tata on the other hand is setting a strong foot and is taking a slight risk with some optimistic pricing. With every other car talked about, I think its the overlap between Feature-loaded top end small car vs moderately loaded bigger car issue.

317, abhi_krao , 07:38 ,BHPian,"I had faced the same issue as Mr Robot. I had pre-booked on 11th Sept and after unveil on 4th, had told dealer I need a creative AMT in Tropical mist. Understand from them that there was a booking window opened that week when dealers had to bill the first lot of vehicles. They select some variants and colors randomly. Once prices were announced, I told dealer again, I want same model without the iRA. He advised that this model was not there in the initial lot that they had booked so we need to wait for the slot to open again. I waited for a few days and realised in this way, I will only get car post Diwali. I called them again to check which cars were available in the first lot, for which he checked and replied manual is available , brown is available and an iRA version is available which is dispatched from factory and if required I can get it as mine is the first booking in the showroom for Punch. Or they will allot to a subsequent booking which is for that variant. Initially I said iRA is not worth the charges but after a day, I called them and asked them to allot to me. My internal justification is that Tata may over the period of time bring in more features in it. The car was alloted to me, it arrived 2 days back in yard, did PDI and got it billed. However, deliveries in Bangalore has not started yet anywhere as officials at RTO are still waiting for their part of creame to be received from dealers. They are only expected to start registering by 2-3 Nov and deliveries may happen by 5-6 in Bangalore.", 31st October 2021,tata-punch,Bangalore,85,179
318, Pramathyu , 02:42 ,BHPian,"Got my Tata Punch delivered on 28th Oct Adventure AMT Tropical Mist Ex showroom 6.99l On road 7.8l 59k RTO, 22k for Insurance (1+2) Attachment 2227061 I would like to thank everyone from team-bhp for their valuable inputs which helped me navigate through my first car buying experience. Though I wanted to pen down my experience and my choice on the day of delivery itself, I thought to myself that I should drive the car atleast for a few days before posting it. Firstly where many people struggle and I did too. Why Tata Punch? Our Requirements: - Car with all basic features - Automatic (Parents don't want the Hassel of a manual) - Budget which was 7l strictly TBH we as a family were going to buy Ignis and it was my dad's first choice on the other hand my mum was quite adamant on Tiago. Tiago wasn't as peppy but had better handling, driving dynamics and better safety with a sublime 1.2l revotron engine. The peppy 1.2l k series engine, better service network and spacious interiors were some pointers why my dad was pushing for Ignis. While they left the decision on me and I decided that we should buy Nissan Magnite the only reason we did not was no provision for an automatic transmission. So we did check out kiger and ultimately dropped the plan because of the 1l engine which feels lacky. If our budget was around 10l we would have definitely bought Magnite even over the Punch. The budget was a big factor in the decision making so even after the Price launch of the Punch we were about to buy Ignis/Tiago whichever would be delivered first. It was 18th when I asked my dad to atleast visit the Tata showroom once and have a look. He did entertain my request finally asked the prices and the SE quoted 8.04l which was a lakh over budget. I could see it on my dad's face his mind was made. Luckily as we stepped out of the dealership there was an Ignis parked on the road. I told my dad look there's your car he looked at it and then went back inside to checkout punch one more time and I could see a slight smile though he wouldn't tell me but now that we have the Punch at our home now I know the meaning of that smile. So, how I convinced my family to buy the punch though it was way out of the budget? - It is a bigger car - It is a better looking car - It is the safest car in India - It is something that no one else has right now. - It feels better to drive (comfort handling) In 8l we could have got the swift amt as well but both my parents did not wanted to buy swift somehow. The punch is actually slotted to go against baleno, swift and kuv apart from ignis or nissan renault cars. The lack of AMT on magnite made it easier to chose Punch. My delivery experience We did an unofficial pre booking with 5k at a dealership and a 21k one at the other dealership. 5k which was done at Commercial Automobiles was in constant contact with my dad though we had to call them everytime but they did what was important and got us the car at which the other dealership failed miserably Frontier motors has still not given back the booking amount they even booked the wrong variant on the wrong date. Frontier had booked a creative amt white in my name while we paid the booking amount on 6th their booking details showed the booking date to be 17thoct. Anyways coming back to the hero's of commercial Tata who got our vehicle in the second lot and provided the car on the same day as it came in the city. My dad got a call from them on 21st congratulating us on the allotment of the car but my dad did not understand what that meant because of the bad experience at Frontier we actually started to look for other options and we did find an Ignis ready white delta amt and we were going to buy that car. So went to Frontier and told them there's a car ready and will you be able to deliver and SE at Frontier told us that he will be able to confirm by 24th so after an hour of discussion we did not cancel there, dont forget that dad has already got the allotment call by this time. So we thought to ourselves ok let's cancel the other booking these fellows are swearing to do to the right thing. Once we reached commercial automobiles everyone started to congratulate us and I was shocked ""*** is happening"". Then one of the SE told me that our car has been alloted and will be delivered by 28th he gave me the chasis number and other details. Surprised and shocked I asked him ""why did you not inform us before"" (because if we knew we would have cancelled the booking at Frontier and also wouldn't have gone through the trouble of looking for other cars). He replied that I did call your dad and I looked at my dad and he was as surprised as me at everything. A little prank on my dad So they had the dealership launch on the very same day. I had to leave but they asked my dad to attend the event also promised to drop him home my dad completely unaware what's going to happen stayed back and then after an hour, I got a really angry call from my dad. My dad is a recluse who doesn't do public event never something where he had to hold a cardboard key and people taking photos. I played a prank on him cause I was aware of what was going to happen and left. ) On 28th we got a call around 3 pm that the cars have arrived to the dealership directly. we reached the dealership around 5 and by 7 we got our car 2 other cars were delivered before us a harrier and a Nexon. The dealership had actually planned an event on 29th where they were going to deliver 5 punch but we insisted to take the delivery on 28th and they obliged. Initial driving experience and reaction of the family and random people The few things I did not like - The pick up is slightly low than MT - The steering is very slightly unresponsive as compared to other Tata cars - The lag from 1st gear to second is almost annoying not on the other gears on the 1st car revs till 3k RPM and then lags for a good second second and a half. Rest everything is great with the car. It's festival season and a lot of family is either visiting us or we are visiting them and everyone loves the car from its first look. We have received so many compliments about the colour of the car that It gets to the brink of being overwhelming. Random people come up to me to ask me about the car how is it? What the name? Is it an EV (mostly because there is no chrome on the car and people are not used to looking at this car also the color maybe) All in all it was a great experience and initially I did feel that the car is overpriced, the launch price could have been set low like its base variant which I think is the most VFM variant if we were not in the market for an AMT Pure would have been the variant of my choice.", 2nd November 2021,tata-punch,Jabalpur,27,99

Now that Tata has delivered the initial batch of cars, the waiting period for the Punch is slowly creeping up. According to a media report, customers in Delhi will have to wait up to 4 months for delivery. Mumbai, Pune and Kolkata customers can expect delays of up to 3 months, while customers in Bangalore and Hyderabad will have to wait for up to 2 months. The cars are readily available in Chennai. The Punch is available in four variants - Pure, Adventure, Accomplished and Creative, with prices starting at Rs. 5.49 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). The Tata Punch is based on the Agile Light Flexible Advanced (ALFA) Architecture. The crossover is powered by a 1.2-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine featuring an automatic engine start / stop function, as well as two drive modes - City and Eco. The engine puts out 85 BHP and 113 Nm and is mated to either a 5-speed manual or 5-speed AMT. Source: Zigwheels", 3rd November 2021,tata-punch,Pune,"6,148","54,806"

I found all colors except Calypso Red. The Blue color was available but my heart was set on Red. This is where Jay and his GM NITESH came into array. They had already billed a calypso red top model and I guess that it was on the way. I thought I would have my hands on it by Dhanteras but god had other plans. The trailer got delayed and reached the dealer yard on Dhanteras night, that meant I could not have had it. I was also wary of taking delivery without doing PDI as per the Team BHP checklist.

Space was good. Sitting in the Nexon I did not feel that the Nexon was so much wider than the Punch. I felt pricewise the Nexon XM is a good comparison to the top end Punch. you get a turbo petrol engine and bit more space. The texture of the plastic on the dashboard and door pads somehow looked cheap. Out of the corner of my eye I spotted a tuft of fabric of the roof liner stick out of the corner. Not great if it catches your eye so easily. The welds around the rear hatch looked crude and unfinished.. The point at which the taillamps meet the body is lined with a crude rubber lining.

A couple of days later he dragged me to a Honda showroom to book City. All the while he kept talking to Hyundai dealer for Creta. When suddenly a Creta materialized, he bought it. He could have bought 2 Wagon R s with some change to spare for the cost of Creta. Where is the segmentation here? In my opinion, having multiple products in the same price brackets works better for a company. For that matter, I too went to test drive a Magnite, explored Nexon, finally settled for Altroz.

Due to current market condition where demand is more than supply, we have to accept what dealers say. Also, they may not allow you to take insurance from outside. Regarding advance payment before PDI, some dealers do insist. It depends on them, if you stick to your stand of making full payment after PDI, they may allot the car to others. Do escalate if required. My take, give the advance but advise them to raise the Invoice only after you do PDi and make full payment. In that case if you are not happy with the car, it can be alloted to others. You may have to wait longer.

True to their word, they did manage to match (even undercut) the quote I got from outside, but I still went with outside since it had 2 extra packages I wanted. The only extras I bought were mudflaps and an extended warranty. Oh, there were no freebies\discount on offer other than the exchange bonus, but since I referred a friend and he too booked the same model, we both got 3D boot mat as complimentary. --Anoop", 31st March 2022,tata-punch,Bangalore,"1,631","2,439"

I did make it clearly that I'd not pay anything apart form the booking amount till the PDI is complete. On a different context: How does one track booking status once the booking has been done. Just to make sure things are moving. I've been quoted a 2 month wait list. But then the SA says, sometimes the allocations are much quicker happening in weeks, while at others takes near 2 or 3 months. They claim that its not in their hands and is mainly by Tata.

Pause is fairly basic functionality, I'd have preferred it over mute. Why would Tata do this? Sort of 'radio' minded.

474, CarguyNish , 19:24 ,Senior - BHPian,"Dear BHPians, happy to share that I took delivery of my Tata Punch on May 13th. Variant is Kaziranga Creative MT in Unique Shade of Grassland Beige with Gloss Black Roof. I had booked the car on April 18th after Test Driving one, drove both MT and AMT and found the latter to be jerky, laggy and not that good except for the fact that gear shifts happen automatically. With no choices, I had to settle for Manual which felt much better. I also traded my 2016 Tata Tiago Diesel for 3.25 lakhs. Most of the variants in Punch Line-up have waiting of 3-5 months, but mine being a limited version and since it's based on top end Creative variant, I managed to get it quicker. Initial Impressions are good. Car is well built, interiors are appealing, seats are much comfortable and are placed high. Driving position is SUV like, Ingress/Egress is very good due to large doors and 90 degree opening. AC is simply Fantastic, easily the best in an under 10 lakh car. It cools in no time no matter the weather outside. Rear AC vents are not missed in this one. Front AC are effective even for rear passengers. Drive experience has been average to say that least. In fact, I felt the engine to be the biggest weak link in this otherwise very good package. Engine has typical 3 cyl character, vibrations are felt at idle and in initial gears. It has weak bottom end, you need to rev it a bit to get moving. 3rd gear is better and 4th and 5th gears are very smooth. Overtaking needs planning, so yeah an iTurbo Engine from Altroz would have made it perform better. Ride quality is very good, takes bumps and potholes with ease without transmitting to cabin. In fact, ride is similar to the Tiago I had been using these years. Handling is also safe and predictable, high speed manners is very mature and brilliant to say the least, doesn't feel like a small car/micro SUV. Steering also weighs up well as speed increases. Overall a Very Good car. Tata should offer the iTurbo Engine on higher variants at a premium, that way the cars dynamics will be justified. Also, an EV version will make it both powerful and efficient. I don't know why Tata is not able to launch it when they have the platform ready for it.

Whats disturbing? Thats how the door locks are supposed to behave in a 'safe' car. If anyone really cares about safety of the kids, he/she would not allow kids to sit at the front seats in first place. First risk is airbags which are deadly for the low height passengers like kids or pets. (read the warning message written on the visor or at other usual location depending on the car model, also read the safety chapter in the user manual instead of watching such dumb Youtube videos). And second thing, be it any type of door lock, if placed at any accessible location then kids can open it while car is moving. Thats why the CHILD LOCKS are provided at inaccessible locations at the rear seats where the kids are supposed to sit. DO USE THE CHILD LOCKs. Problem is not the lock system shown in the Punch, problem is people are grown with the locking system of Maruti/Mahindra and old Tata cars. And chances are higher for getting trapped inside the car in case of panic situation like flood or fire. Our hands automatically tend to reach at the door opening lever in case of such panic situation instead of searching the lock first then opening the door. People don't have much time to react in most of the panic situations, you may have read many news headlines where people charred to death in a burning car or drowned in a sinking car. Those people did not do it deliberately, rather many of them could not open the doors in time. Getting it? If there are electrically controlled locks then they are also prone to fail if there is short circuit or battery/electric failure in case of any accident, fire or flood. German cars, which are known for their safety also come with such door locking system where doors can always be opened using the single lever and front doors never get locked permanently. Since New gen Tata cars also have European DNA, they are safer, sturdier and following some European norms while implementing some features. Indian Youtube scene is very pathetic and disappointing with so many dumb people spreading so much misconception just for the 'views, likes and subscribes'. I have set a rule for myself and always tell people that DO NOT WATCH ANY YOUTUBE VIDEO MADE BY INDIANs. There are chances that 99 out of 100 videos made on same topic will be spreading misconception in the name of information and review. Even if you watch then take them with pinch of salt, take some info like knowing about some specs or features, but do not take the opinion. For example this guy in this Youtube video shows the locks and tells his negative opinion, If I watch this video then my reaction will be like - 'nice, this car one more intelligent safety feature' and I will will ignore the opinion of that guy.", 3rd July 2022,tata-punch,India,806,"1,478"
487, docted , 18:24 ,BHPian,"My wife decided to finally get behind the wheel last year, being a gynecologist and the whole COVID situation restricting cab services and unforseen lockdownds etc. She even got her LL and we were scouting cars. But Delta raised its head and sideshow went sideways, on off on off, LL has expired and the whole cycle started again. Finally this time around she is started her driving classes and we just booked the Tropical Blue Accomplished MT, and now we wait, apparently 30 weeks. 🤯 Our car needed the following A) Cheap, but 1st hand looking for maximum financing B) Need to go from point A to B, school run, and God forbid any emergency, we have a Compass 2.0D 4x4 MT for all other runs. C) Safety with ISOFIX, we have a 2 year old and this was where I put my foot down. The cars in consideration were Maruti Ignis / Swift / Wagon R. All come with ISOFIX and a good engine, after sales, but safety was iffy. Renault /Nissan Kwid was out of contention Kiger twins were costing 1.5 lakhs more and the 1.0 turbo was nearly 11 otr Hyundai Never owned one nor spent long term with one, chose a known devil in Maruti over this. TATA Tigor, we nearly booked this last year, and was on top of the list, but Punch punched through in terms of space and more upright sitting. Plus the price difference was down to 40k odd. I usually advise people for top end variant and save the headache of running around garage to add features ( that's because I can't squeeze time with my work) But in this case to keep price down we settled for a lower variant, must have were - Safety, Isofix, Driver height adjustment, all door power window and central lock, reverse camera with guideline, fog lamps with cornering. Things missing - better lights and auto fold irvm ( will get this from outside.) Decided to stick with R15 for better sidewall and the Hypwrsegmented steel wheel look good. Cruise control is a wasted feature for me but did not have a choice. The 1.2 engine is lackluster (coming from the 2.0D of.compass) but should suffice for someone learning to go from A to B, till we swap cars.", 5th July 2022,tata-punch,Gurgaon,50,192
488, blitz_nomad , 15:09 ,BHPian,"I find this disturbing too. If it is going to open in a single action - why bother with the lock at all then? Not just with kids, even with adults. Don't want anyone accidentally opening the door - say someone brushing against while moving and something getting hooked to it. Quote: Originally Posted by tbppjpr Our hands automatically tend to reach at the door opening lever in case of such panic situation instead of searching the lock first then opening the door. People don't have much time to react in most of the panic situations, But you are ok with a child lock in such situations? In cases like fire where this is an issue that reaction time needs to be so less that you can not flip another lock knob, I'd be very skeptical about the actions that follow after you've opened the door - getting out of the car. I'd imagine this to be more of a lifesaver in situations where a passenger needs to say jump off the car. A concern that a lock may not release in an accident say get jammed - is more valid a cause. But then here, they have not gotten rid of the door lock. Its just that the way you lock and unlock is different. If providing a separate knob for the lock increases the chances of a lock jam than this mechanism, may be it justifies this locking mechanism. At any rate, You need to weigh the benefits in terms of the chances of that event happening vs the chances that somebody opens the door accidentally. Somehow I feel the later is a higher chance event with this locking mechanism. In general you spend much more time in a car than an incident that involves such an hazard (fire, drowning, accidents etc). The more time you spend, the more likely you may brush into the handle in some odd way. I might well be wrong since I'm new to driving, but fact remains, I find the door lock disturbing.

I am driving a car with same type of lock with full appreciation and confidence since last 11 years and nobody did it accidentally or intentionally in the moving car. And the design of the door opening latch is such that there is no way someone can open it just by brushing it, neither some cloth or something else can get stuck in such door latches. Punch also got the same design latch, try to observe it closely when you get in your Punch next time. Some playful kid defiantly can open the door latch though, be it two way or one way locking system. I have heard such incidents taking place in old school cars with two way locking systems. Thats why its advised to make them sit at rear seats with inaccessible child locks on and I have been following this advise strictly in my car. My son always traveled with seat belts on with the child seat when he was infant. And now after he has grown enough to be seated at front seats, he searches for the seatbelts whenever he enters in the car, be it at rear or front seats. Quote: But you are ok with a child lock in such situations? Yes, absolutely, child locks are must with the kids if you care little bit about their safety. You can't control the situation with your hands on the steering wheel in a fast moving car when some playful kid ended up opening the door. Going by your logic, seatbelts are also hindrance and have been alien things for majority of Indians so they also should not be used, right?

Sure. The risk of a random crazy mob thrashing oneself or a thief stealing increases as your speed increases and therefore they decided to put in an auto-lock mechanism when the car speeds up. Quote: Originally Posted by tbppjpr Going by your logic, seatbelts are also hindrance and have been alien things for majority of Indians so they also should not be used, right? Wrong. A recap: My logic is that a separate knob for locking is worth the safety. So in my view, the child lock, the seat belts, all of it also makes sense. They are all worth the safety even though they may get in your way in cases where you need to get out quickly. It is your logic that highlights that two stage locks aren't safe because they get in the way of getting out during an emergency situation. So it is by this logic that the seat belt and the child lock become a hindrance too. Not the other way round. Anyway, to each his own. May be I will get used to these locks as you say and may be there is no possibility of the latch getting hooked to anything. Nevertheless, I still think many will be weary of this and I wouldn't say their fears are unwarranted either. There was at least one such incident reported here (Which type of car door lock do you prefer?).

493, mbudhraja , 19:26 ,Newbie,"For quite sometime, we had been looking for a worthy replacement for our 19 year old Wagon R which had done 6 digit kms. The vehicle was dear to my father in law and we wanted the new car to be something modern, refreshing and as practical as his first gen wagonR. He lives in Bhubaneshwar and the car is used for city driving as well as trips to his village in the Puri district - for the uninitiated, the roads even in villages of this part of the country can give any highway a run for its money. Shortlisting 1. Brand - The old man's preference for Japanese cars - he clearly wanted to buy a Honda or Toyota after the Suzuki 2. Size - The garage space was a major constraint, restricting our search to sub 4m cars only 3. Gearbox - No automatics, I learnt that the joy of manual transmission over the comfort of automatics prevails even at the age of 60+ 4. Safety - My wife wanted a safe car for her father, no compromise on that front With Etios Liva being discontinued, based on the above and the fact that I already own a Jazz, we right away requested a Honda Jazz test drive. Unfortunately, we realized that even a full size 4m car could not properly fit in the garage. This meant that we would have to narrow the search down to smaller hatches only. This was August 2021 and the choices were limited and simple - (1) New WagonR, Ignis or Celerio (Japanese touch, though no safety), (2) Tiago, (3) Santro or Nios. We did not give much consideration to DatsunGo or the KUV 100. Options Considered TBH, all these cars did not seem like an upgrade from the Wagon R 1. The Santro was not in consideration even back in 2003, so it made no sense now. Eliminating Hyundai altogether was simple, it's neither Japanese nor safe 2. We had been reading about the new Celerio for a while but the launch was delayed. Going for a new WagonR ticked most of the boxes, but it did not feel right to go for the same car again. After all, this was a new car after 19years. The choices left were Ignis and Tiago. One was clearly safer while the other was clearly more refined. It was clearly a compromise and no one was happy. We had even considered parking the car outside of the garage in the street - after all, he deserved to buy a better car (Jazz or Urban Cruiser). After a lot of deliberation, we half heartedly booked the Ignis around mid of October 2021. The road gets bumpier Make no mistake, we did know the punch was launching within a week and were ok to consider it. Plus the pressure to make my father in law get a new car was mounting on me. My trip to Bhubaneshwar was about to end and if we didn't book it this time, the old man would get his WagonR's registration extended for another 5 years. My gut said - how small an SUV can it be ? If a 3.99m car cannot fit in the garage, how comfortable would it be to park a 3.8xx m inside each day. Fasten your seatbelts 3 days after booking the Ignis, we went to the TATA Motors showroom. I personally was very excited to check the Punch - I knew TATA Motors had been rolling out great products lately, but all of them seemed to be packed with small glitches. Hence I knew the punch would not be a gamechanger either. An year ago, I was left heaart broken when I wanted to buy an Altroz for myself but went ahead with the Jazz because of the poor refinement and interior finishing in the Altroz. BOOM - if looks could kill and all that moment... None of us were expecting the Punch to be such a looker. It looked heavy, it looked futuristic, it looked compact. It had pleasantly good interiors for a TATA car, and hardly any panel gaps whatsover. This was hard to believe. The family went crazy that finally there is an option worthy of replacing the 1st gen WagonR. However I had my reservations. After all, this was a Tata car which in a way meant that you could be trading your peace of mind for good road presence. Plus the neck to neck parking space each day was going to be a challenge. In fact the sales agent refused to make a parking attempt in our garage. But taking measurements with a ruler in his hand, my father in law was confident that he could make it work. We booked the Punch Pure variant (to avoid all the tech shenanigans) on October 26, 2021. We were committed a delivery within 3 months, but it took 4. The delivery was done on February 28, 2022. 9 months after making the booking, I am back in Bhubaneshwar and have been trying my hands on this beauty for the last few days. Here's my observations and honest views about the car - 2000KM / 4 month ownership review of my Tata Punch Looks and Road Presence Like I said, Punch is a looker (just like other TATA cars). While the front of the car has a Harrier/Nexon like presence, there is a futuristic touch to the rear like an EV concept car. The claddings in the side and across the body add the muscle. It doesn’t look like a sub 10L car and no other cars at this price point come close in terms of road presence. Space and Comfort The seating position is nice and high and gives a proper SUV feel. The headroom and front legroom is extremely good while the rear space is sufficient to fit two adults and a kid. The boot can carry 2 large suitcases. Interiors Not an area of strength for Tata Motors, but they have done quite a neat job in the Punch. The dash is made of hard plastic but the quality is very good and there is no unnecessary rattle. The black and white schemed digital meters look classy. However some of the buttons seem to be delicate. Drive Quality The high ground clearance and the SUV nature of the vehicle ensures that this easily glides through any bumpy breakers or holes that a city has to offer. We have not tried off-roading but this certainly seems capable for the challenge. There are YouTube videos of punch doing extremely well in off roads. We went past some of the roads that were water and mud laden because of construction work, and we couldn’t feel anything. This is a big plus over any of the hatches or compact sedans. Punch clearly beats my jazz when it comes to this department. High speed stability seems exceptionally well - I constantly did 100-120kmph speeds on the Bhubaneshwar-Puri highway and the car added a lot of confidence. Engine Refinement and Power The 1.2L Revetron Engine of Tata continues to be an Achilles heel. The power is sufficient for city driving and the pull in lower gears is very good. The ability to glide at triple digits in the highways is as good as any other 1.2L NA engine (other than Ford’s dragon engines, I miss Ford ). I struggled to push the car beyond 120kmph though. However it is the refinement and the NVH levels where the rivals have a big upper hand. My FIL too agreed that his Wagon R was way more refined. Having said that, I personally enjoyed the slight vibrations and cabin noise. It complements the high seating position and the SUV feel. CONS of Tata Punch: 1. Engine refinement – like any other 3 cylinder TATA car. 2. Gear Shifts – While the gear shifting is smooth, it is not crisp. I would have preferred the gears to be more sharp and distinct. 3. Door Lock – The door locks seem to be integrated to the door lever. There is no separate physical button or knob in the doors for lock / unlock. Strangely, this seems to be a compromise in safety. The door gets unlocked once you pull the door leaver even from the passenger or rear side while driving. A single accidental pull of the lever even when the car is at high speed can open the door. Lastly, the biggest positive of this vehicle in my view is the Value For Money that it brings to the table. Tata Punch is the most comprehensive value for money package that one can ask for. There is a price difference of 4L on road between the base variant (Pure) and the top variant (Kaziranga / AMT / iRA). This is too much for the same engine and an AMT gear box. Hence the lower variants become very value for money. We booked Pure variant + Rhythm pack at <7L on road and this seemed like a steal to me. Eventually we did change our booking to just the Pure variant. The car has almost everything that an ordinary household requires. This should be an easy pick over the Ignis, Swift, Nios or even some of the compact sedans and premium hatches. ", 26th July 2022,tata-punch,BANGALORE,18,143

Would like to know more about the FE figures observed. For those who think the engine is underpowered, please do a test drive in the city. It has enough torque and oomph for relaxed city drives.

508, Chethan B G , 15:32 ,Senior - BHPian,"European and some western cars used to have Dead lock. It means that the lever had to be pulled twice for the car door to open. In recent times (a few years back), it was seen that there was a possibility of these type of locks getting jammed during accidents. Therefore, dead locks were discontinued as a safety measure.

I personally feel removing it is a step in the wrong direction. Especially considering Indian roads and usage of cars, not sure such western standards should be straight away adopted by us without second thoughts This might be a deal breaker for many.

Equally I feel the Altroz would be just as fitting as a rally contender considering the history of hot hatches in rallying. Nice mock up, though it feels like it's missing a lot of the aero gubbins and front splitter etc that modern rally cars incorporate (Not sure if current regs have changed this or not - just know they have to be hybrid now). The rhino motif is nice. For a road going version though it might all be a bit much for me. Maybe a customer spec rally offering? I wonder if the Indian OEMs will ever take a punt at a factory motorsports effort - I doubt win on Sunday, sell on Monday translates as much to Indian audiences, so they've never needed to engage in racing from a marketing standpoint.

So far I have driven about 150 km in both heavy traffic and highways. The choice was between Adventure + Rhythm and accomplished which was 40k costlier.

Co passengers didn't feel the gear change. 2. In start stop kind of traffic, it took me time to get used but it very easy drive in such conditions and you could inch forward as you do in MT 3. In city if you are in eco mode pick up is sluggish. In city mode it is OK. You can't dart out of signals but car quicky gains speed. 4. I was a co passenger when we drove in a highway.

I simply said it's the way regulations are headed. I did not mean unlock, the VW cars open with a single pull as well. At least the Punch has push in to lock thing going for it, VW doesn't even have that! Why? Because that's how it's in Europe. Children must necessarily be seated on the backseat, with child locks on the doors turned on which prevents opening of the door from inside. All cars with this mechanism have child locks in the rear because it's simply illegal to have a child seated in the front passenger seat.

Till then, I had spent pittance on this wonderful car. First tyre change at 65K, next at 135K and then the front tyres at 175K. All the parts are stock and no major overhaul till now. The well calibrated HPS, excellent ergonomics and driving comfort made it a pleasure to drive in spite of the slightly under powered but eager duratec 1.2l petrol engine. Best in class AC, wonderful music system, electrically adjustable OVRMs, RVM with antiglare features, theater style dimming cabin lamps were all VFM features which many of the cars of that time didn't have. It is one of the finest hatch backs to have been made and no wonder there are quite a few old generation Figo's still on road Having decided to replace, the requirements were clear. Budget of 10 lacs max, AT and petrol. Vehicles considered Amaze CVT. - The top variant was above my budget and the S variant didn't have touch screen display. Also the poor mileage reported was a deal breaker Ignis. Somehow the vehicle didn't connect with me. Didn't consider Baleno Punch: I read about the under powered engine and the head nodding AMT and I was skeptical when I took the TD. The TD changed my opinion and decided on the vehicle without having a look at other options Buying and dealership experience: I walked in to Lakshmi TATA showroom in Ekkatuthangal to check out the Altroz. The car looked fabulous but decided against due the following reasons. 1. DCT - Not sure of its reliability after 4-5 years and cost of service and repairs 2. Turbo petrol - Same reasons as above I was looking at NA petrol when he SA suggested that I have TD in Punch. I booked for TD and the SA brought the vehicle to my house the next day. Took the TD without much to look forward but the TD changed my opinion 1. Excellent feed back from the steering. As good as the Figo 2. Very comfortable driving position and the bonnet line visibility 3. Chiller AC 4. Excellent sound quality of the Harmon music system 5. It was my first time with AMT and I found no jerks or head nods. In Eco mode it felt sluggish but in city mode the pickup was OK. The choice was between Adventure Rythm pack and Accomplished. Decided to go for Accomplished since it had cruise control, height adjustable driver seat and PEPS for 40K extra Booking was done in the second week of October and quoted delivery was first week of December. It was fine with me since the monsoon rains would be over by then. But within a week the SA called and said the vehicle as been allotted and I could take delivery by End of October. Took delivery on 3rd November. The experience from booking to delivery was smooth and full marks to the dealer. I have driven 2200 kms till now and first service has been done. The following are the observations. 1. First service was done at 1600 kms. Opted for 3M under body coating which costed about Rs.1900/- Consumable for first service came to around Rs.400/- The vehicle was picked up for service from my house and I picked it up after service. The service experience good 2. The vehicle feels much peppier now (is it due to the engine settling after run in period or some ECU update, I am not sure). In city mode the engine revs up to 3000rpm before shifting 3. I get around14~15kmpl on mixed runs (city + free runs) and I got 20kmpl during a drive of 380 kms to Thiruvannamalai and back. 4. Gear shift is smooth (I am a light footed driver) but a few mild jerks are noticed sometimes when the vehicle decelerates and shifts from 2 to 1 gear. 5. I noticed this when using cruise control. If you set cruise control at say 90km, slow down and again press the restart, the acceleration is very fast and reaches the set speed very quickly. When I first did this I was startled by the acceleration. This could be used as work around when you had to do tight overtakes. Set the cruise control to higher speed than your normal driving speed. When you need to overtake, press the restart cruise button the steering wheel and zoom ahead. Come back to your driving speed by tapping on the A or B pedal 6. Except for trying it out, I didn't feel the need to use manual mode. 7. Vehicle easily reaches 100kmph and I didn't feel the lack of power. Beyond that I am not sure If you are planning to buy AMT, do a longish test drive and ensure it suits your driving style.

572, Emvi , 22:17 ,BHPian,"Recently I had the opportunity to test drive the 2023 model Punch twice. First was at a dealership(manual variant) and second was my relative's car(AMT variant) which he took delivery just a fortnight ago. The test drive in the manual variant was short, but it was an eye-opener nonetheless. I had test-driven the first generation Punch long ago and back then, I was far from impressed with its NVH level and engine response. However, in comparison, the current generation Punch is remarkably silent and its engine is quite responsive. I took my relative's AMT version for a drive a few days later, which further reiterated my observations. I drove the car from south Bangalore to Devanahalli and back(~100 kms). I have to say that I don't have much experience driving cars with AT / AMT. To my surprise, it was impressive the way the car performed in bumper to bumper traffic situation. We were 4 people in the car and it's performance was quite a revelation to me although I stuck to the speed limit on airport road and did not push the car much. Just a few things to summaries -1. The NVH level has improved considerably. 2. The acceleration / engine response too has improved a couple of notches at the least. 3. AMT is not bad as many of us think it is. For Bangalore traffic kind of usage it serves it's purpose pretty well IMO. 4. After the drive, the odometer showed that the car had covered around 300 kms, and the MID displayed an overall FE of 10.5 kmpl. However, on the airport road stretch, the car's infotainment system reported a FE of 17.4 kmpl.

AMT functioning is kind of OK, even when my current drive is a Vento TDI DSG. The jerk in 1st and 2nd gear is lesser in AMT. Above that it's the DSG which is a clear winner by a big margin. I found that the progress till 80 KMPH is acceptable. Beyond that it felt too slow. Ride was also quite good. No problem in handling either. NVH while accelerating was more than my expectation, but while cruising it was quite ok. I reset the MID FE few times during the TD. On an open stretch @ 80 kmph, got a display of 19.5 kmpl. I think on highways with sedate driving this car can deliver close to 20 kmpl. This was a BS-6 phase 1 demo car. Also took a very short drive of a phase 2 car which was due for delivery to a customer after a gap of 10 odd days of driving the phase 1 demo car. Cann't comment much on that car, which felt more or less the same as phase 1. Hopefully the improvement in NVH & low end drivability is perceptible, which will be a real boon for me.

579, Chitta Pradhan , 14:59 ,BHPian,"I had taken a TD of Magnite CVT earlier and today I again took a TD of the same car. I have booked a Punch AMT as my 2nd car primarily for city use. Now I am evaluating other automatic petrol options till the time Punch arrives. I am open to cancellation of Punch. Also I actually don't need a 2nd car, as I am the only one in my family who drive now. Just because I am getting bored of driving one car (Vento TDI DSG), taking a 2nd one. A smaller footprint and higher seating car will be surely more convenient for city usage. The engine & CVT combo of Magnite is way superior to Punch. Though AMT is kind of ok in Punch, the pick up of the car is too slow. Even then I am inclined more towards Punch for the following reasons- 1. 5 star safety against 4 star. 2. To me Punch looks better. 3. Interior of Punch feels better. 4. AC effectiveness is better in Punch ( from TD experience). 5. 90 degree door opening in Punch. 6. Punch will be more fuel efficient. I still want to consider Magnite only for the power and seemless CVT it offers without perceptible rubber band effect. While TD I got the FE in MID reset and after the TD I got a reading of 13.5 kmpl. In same condition, my Vento would have shown 20 kmpl. While taking TD of Punch in another route, I got a MID FE of 17.5 kmpl. I apprehend that Magnite CVT may be approx 4 kmpl less fuel efficient than Punch AMT, which is a concern for me. What kind of FE are you getting in Punch AMT. I am confused which car should I go for. Any insights? Any other car should I check? I am searching for a safe, automatic, petrol and high seating car.

583, firingpistonz , 12:35 ,BHPian,"Hi there. After a lot of dilly-dallying, I have finally decided to go ahead with a Punch. I was confused between a Punch and an Ignis. after a lot of thought, I decided to go ahead with the Punch. I found the improvements to the BS6 phase 2 car to be astonishing. I had last test driven the car in Dec of 2022, there was audible engine noise and it felt unrefined. Now it is all gone, it highly refined and drivable. Cannot believe its the same engine. Though it is not as smooth and drivable as its suzuki counterpart, it is still closer. But the vague/notchy gear throws and long-clutch travel (compared to Ignis) is still present. This is our second car and I would like to keep the cost as low as possible. Coming back to the point/questions I have 1) I have booked an Accomplish MT. I am confused between an Adventure Rhythm and the aforementioned variant. The only features that I need (that are present in the Accomplish variant), driver height adjustable seats and fog lamps. Keyless entry to some extent(as they only give one remote key in Adv Rhythm variant). The other extra features like cruise control, rear LED lights and stylized wheel covers are just somethings that I dont need. With this, is it advisable to go for Accomplish. The difference in price between the two are 35-40K. Is it worth the extra money? The SA says ADV rhythm and Creative Variants are the top selling variants. Accomplish and Pure are very less in numbers. 2) I am planning to opt for only 3 accessories from the dealer. Mud flaps, floor mats and Window visors. Are there any other must-have accessories that I need? 3) I have opted for the EW extension for 15900, and I feel this is necessary. What Im not sure about is the Gold AMC plan. It costs Rs 16500. Fellow owners, please advice if this is useful/must have. I'm not sure about this as I have never opted for this with our earlier cars. 4) Should I upgrade the tyres to 195 width? is it really warranted that it will improve ride/handling or both.", 30th May 2023,tata-punch,BENGALURU,33,33

585, Chitta Pradhan , 14:59 ,BHPian,"Took delivery of Creative AMT in Red Dual tone color yesterday. Other car that I use is Vento TDI DSG. So far I have driven only 80 km. Few initial impressions- - Delivery experience is super smooth. - AMT lag though clearly perceptible, is not bothersome. I never thought that I will buy an AMT ever. But my TD experience with regard to AMT was positive, and remains the same in my car too. I had taken a short TD of Maruti Breeza AT. This 6 speed TC seemed to be more confused that the 5 speed AMT of Punch. - Low speed punch is very good in my Punch. The car is quick enough to 90 kmph, beyond that I have not tried yet in my car. But in TD car, I had found that reaching 100 kmph was kind of easy, beyond which it was a clear struggle. - Ride is stiffer than Vento, but still quite comfortable. - AC blower noise beyond fan speed 3 and more is too much. In Auto AC mode, the fan speed is not going to 2 or below ( temp setting ~24 ), requiring manually lowering the fan speed to 2. Hopefully with cooler ambient temperature, it may go to 2 or below. - Space as experienced from driver's seat is more in Punch than Vento, because of more headroom. It feels like driving a much bigger car than the size it actually is. - Engine is slightly audible inside the cabin almost at all speeds, but is not at all a concern. It's almost 80% as refined as Maruti/Hyundai 4 cylinder units. - No vibration felt on steering wheel & gear lever even at idle. - While going to office in the morning ( mostly open flyover of 12 km), MID FE in Vento is ~ 22kmpl. Today morning I went to office for the first time in Punch, MID FE came to ~ 18 kmpl. After running in, I think it will be close to Vento FE, if not more. - One major concern- with 4/5 times pumping of break in congested traffic or while parking in tight spot etc., the break becomes hard and non-functional ( almost). I have never experienced this problem in any car when the engine is running. If engine is off, then of course this happens after use of brake for 4/5 times. Is this a problem common to all Punch or it's specific to my car only? Need comments please, so that I can take the car to service station. Thanks", 3rd June 2023,tata-punch,Bhubaneswar,520,197

Yesterday, I did 2nd tankful ( not autocut) after 200 km of usage in city. The MID was showing 10.2 km/lit where as as per manual calculation it just came to 7.2 km/l ie a whopping 30% error. I do doubt the BPCL pump's fuel quantity. MID error in my present Vento is just 1%, in earlier Verna it was 5%. It can not be 30% in Punch. You must have calculated the FE MID error in your car. How much it is? Even 10.2 kmpl is too less. After running in, it may improve slightly only. Does post running in, car's FE goes up significantly?

Tata Tiago XZA+ Tata Altroz XMA Tata Punch Adventure AMT Maruti Suzuki Baleno AMT Did not consider Renault Kiger or Magnite ( not a big fan of the design) After thorough research - Zeroed in on Tiago NRG AMT and was almost going to buy the same but changed my mind to Tata Punch. During the TD and the overall review what prompted me to get Punch. Looks Stylish Good Ground Clearance. 5 star safety - Body build is good. In Budget - Micro SUV. Decent AMT gearbox - not a driving enthusiast so should do the Job. Need for Power - Good Enough...not gonna blast my way past the Bangalore Traffic. So, approached multiple different dealers at Bangalore and zeroed in on Key Motors.. It's always good to get multiple Quotations - Made sure I get a quote with the bare basics of Exshowroom,Road tax,Fast tag and Registration charges - nothing more.. I was being quoted insurance atleast 12k more than what I got outside... Finally opted for Royal Sundaram Zero dep Insurance for close to 24k - Good deal. Choosing a colour was tricky - loved both the Daytona grey and the Tropical most - after a lot of thoughts and reviews went ahead with the grey cos it looks so stylish and beautiful plus small scratches will not show up. Booked the car and waited for 1 month, after the car allocation went for a PDI and made sure I took time to check all the car components - both exterior and interior, was not very impressed by some panel gaps but overall a strong beast.. Taking my car delivery tommorow , also forgot I will be getting Spoiler,Roof rails and sun visor installed from the showroom. Will update once I drive the car..

602, raghulsudheesh , 17:27 ,BHPian,"My friend had taken a Tata Punch from Kropex Tata in Bangalore in December 2022. This was after positive feedback from me and other Tata users. I have had a Zest, Tiago and Nexon in the past. Currently we have a Harrier at home. The initial Tata dealer we had approached wasn't even bothered to give us a test drive. After a senior Tata Motors official intervened, we made the booking with Kropex Tata. Getting the delivery itself was a herculean task as Kropex never sticked to the promised dates. We had a long wait. I was also there to take the delivery in Bangalore. They kept us waiting for almost two hours in the showroom and goofed up the whole experience. They misplaced our HSRP sticker which came along with the number plates. They sticked another car's sticker which never belonged to us. We realised this only after reaching back home from the showroom. We wrote a detailed mail to Kropex and a Senior Tata Motors official about the whole experience and our requirement to get the correct HSRP sticker for our car. Till date, they haven't done anything on the front. Service is another mess! Our car's service is shown as done at some service centre in the North. Despite taking up this with Kropex and Tata, they haven't corrected. Second service was again done at Kropex recently and they made us remove the memory card from the dash camera. Currently, we are trying to get a new HSRP sticker issued to us through an agent from our end.

I have been driving the punch for a month now and the biggest con I observed was no hill hold assist..in a steep inclination the car goes back aggressively if you release the break and the creep doesn't work...I am still getting used to the handbrake usage during such scenarios..

Thank dear Benoit for the heads up. I finally took my 3 days old Punch to ASS on last Saturday (car is in Bhubaneswar) and the SA decided to keep it over the weekend to observe and diagnosis. This was done in presence of CRM head who was also actively involved in the process. I came back to my work city Pune afterwards in same afternoon. SA called me last evening (Sunday) to mention the issue has been resolved with some murmuring about issue with Bonnet. He then again called half an hour later to notify the cause as ""rodent chewed up the wiring"". He told me that he has managed it without a job card and it would cost me 1500/- rupees. His logic was since rodent causes are not covered under warranty, hence by doing it without a job card would help me save money on replacing entire module. I called up CRM and strongly told her that, I would rather pay up for entire module, but I don't want a patch work on wiring on a 3 day old car. I preferred a job card with clear mention of issue, ""car age"" and the solution. I, also told her that a repair work without a job card would simply create issue in future warranty claim as it could be termed as an outside job as there wouldn't be any record of repair. Also, there was more chances of rodent attack in their yard than my house. She called back 10 minutes later and assured me that they have took the entire module out of another new car and put it in my car and there were no repair work on wiring. She had asked me not to pick the car same evening. She would inspect the car on Monday and talk to the SA regarding the job done before releasing the car. She also told me that the SA should not have charged me for the work and she would make sure the charges would have been revoked. Crossing my finger and waiting for the call.

You will find a different airbox positioned on the top of the engine for the phase 1 models. 2- Better insulation and engine mount to reduce vibration. You will find different engine clamps in phase 2. Also, the induction system improves the idle grunt. 3- Ecu remapping due to the change in air induction system. This also leads to the mileage increase due to more usable power in lower rpm leads to less need to press the pedal and lesser stress on engine. The top end remains unchanged though. Overall, combining these three, the upgrade became significant.

At start, the engine was startlingly silent, it being a three cylinder engine and that too a tata. Was impressed by the fit and finish inside the cabin and the tall seating position. I first sat in the front passenger seat and i could easily see the edges of the bonnet,kudos to tata for keeping the front passenger in mind which in my opinion is a common neglected area by the other manufacturers. The vehicle felt solid in build and the thickness of the sheet metal was satisfactory. The ride quality was excellent considering the size of the vehicle, the undulations and pot holes on the road were masked very well at speed, and the cabin was quiet. This was my first experience in driving an AMT and the experience was not that bad .The car starts to move as soon as you lift the leg from the brake paddle,and it holds on to the gears if we push the accelerator hard in order to gain speed ,while on the other hand if we are gentle on the throttle the upshifts come early and the car is silent,but at the same time we can feel the momentum of gear change. I came back very much impressed by the car's ride quality and its build.The windows at the backseat are wide enough to appreciate the surroundings, the back support is good and the seats are angled to give nice underthigh support. If we push forward the driver seat at it highest position the left knee touches the lower part of the instrument panel, and so I had to move it back and angle back the seat for a comfortable position. Persons with less height may face this problem and may find it difficult to find a comfortable position. The Herman music system is excellent, best in its class and the music had bass and treble neatly balanced and was not distorted at 80% volume. The car is not overpriced for the features it offers especially in the lower 3/4 variants,but at the same time offers a wide choice to the customers to pick and choose as per their requirements.

651, rayvonnee , 02:05 ,Newbie,"I recently serviced my Tata Punch at a Tata Motors Authorised Service Center in Mumbai. It was the 3rd Free Service. One thing I noticed was that brake cleaning was suggested by the Service Advisor which was quoted as Rs. 1000/- and consumables were an additional Rs. 300/- On asking them if service would not include cleaning brakes, the SA said that only inspection is a part of free service and not cleaning. I checked the owners manual and could not find Brake Cleaning specifically mentioned anywhere, just inspection is mentioned, hence gave the go ahead for it. I saw my vehicle getting serviced and the technicians used compressed air to clean the drums and front disc pads were sanded and installed back. No brake cleaner spray had been used and nor were the caliper pins lubricated. At the time of billing I noticed that charges were added mentioning ""Rear Anchor Plate Removal Install and Replace Parts"". On questioning the same, the SA said that these are charges for Brake cleaning. I paid the bill and didn't want to argue further. However, for my uncles Nexon BS-6 Diesel (3rd Free service) again the service advisor added brake cleaning and quoted 1500/- this time and an extra 500/- for consumables. On questioning these extra charges, he gave the usual explanation of only inspection being a part of the service and not cleaning. The SA somehow convinced my uncle to take the AMC Silver package and said that brake cleaning would be free if AMC is taken which would also cover charges for Engine Oil, Oil Filter, AC Filter, Wheel Alignment and Balancing. Hence, opted for AMC Silver package. I did write an email to Tata regarding this but there has been no positive response on the same and they just keep forwarding the complaint back to the dealers.

There are times(very heavy traffic), where I could barely extract 300kms from a tankful.", 22nd January 2024,tata-punch,Hyderabad,"1,033","1,499"

Is this a mistake present for long or an advance update on what is to come soon? To clarify this is not the Punch.eV (as evident from the steering wheel). Secretly also hoping for an ICE update alongside. Looking to make use of the corporate car lease policy coming FY onwards and Punch remains my top contender & I am not happy with its current ICE setup, checks all the other boxes though.

Came across this Product from Turtle Wax and applied it myself after a thorough shampoo wash using a microfiber cloth. Apparently, the cladding are back to their original color now and appear a bit shinier. Do try it once. Also, I think we will need to keep applying this every few months to maintain the cladding.

666, Aarhot , 20:20 ,BHPian,"Hello Bhpians, Have a question regarding the way my car billing was handled by SELECT cars, Chanda Nagar. We bought Punch AMT in October 1st week and it was billed with all required documentation, insurance n temporary RTA documents shared. To my surprise, when I visited for the 1st service in December at another service center (Venkataramana), they refused initially mentioning that I am late for 1st service by 45 days. When confronted, they mentioned that sale date on Tata shows as Aug 31st and they count it from that day. Another finding was that the vehicle was showing on someone else name and their address and mobile phone was still on this vehicle. I was dumbfounded by this and when I reached to the idiot who screwed up all this behind the scenes with improper documentation, he was like - come to our service center and we will get the service done. When asked for this mess up, he was like we can't do anything now as Tata doesn't allow sale date changes. Anyone knows if this is a regular practice by all such dealers to put a sale date without getting the vehicle sold at all ? I had escalated to their customer mgmt team and they were pathetic in giving any genuine reasons as to why this happened and why can't they get all this fixed. I anyways got my details corrected but the sale date is still not fixed neither they r going to do anything. I was promised by their regional customer mgr that I will be able to go for remaining services as per the schedule based on my purchase date but good for nothing TML is sending early reminders to get my 2nd service done this month whereas its due in April. Really a bad experience from TML and its dealership. Avoid such dealerships at any cost. They can go any extent to get their commissions on time but won't help later for all the goof-ups that they did in the name of shitty services...", 26th February 2024,tata-punch,TS,28,22

Consider yourself lucky as you did not end up getting a car like this from them. Quoting from that thread - Quote: The Job card is where I became more suspicious as the TR number, Address, Phone number, last visit to service center, KMs run are completely different and not seem to be by accident as well. Before I made a complaint with Tata Motors customer care number. I received the sms confirmation along with TR number. When I checked with that it's same as in the job card, not mine. I had IRA app installed, there also everything is not mine its some one else's. I took all the screen shots as they can be changed later. I want to pursue more on this if my request for the new car is denied. This can potentially lead to serious legal implications if proven true. I also raised this concern to Regional Customer Care Manager as well. ", 27th February 2024,tata-punch,KA20,123,746

671, Aksfdb , 17:19 ,Newbie,"When it comes to cars there are a myriad of options available and its very easy to get confused and arrive at a decision. There are a lot of factors to be considered right from the Brand, Model, engine options (Power, Fuel, Turbo, NA etc.), Transmission, looks, feel, color, features etc.. and the list goes on. I was recently faced with the same situation and then I decided that I will share my experience with the members of the forum. Having read through so many articles on the forum about different cars, its kind of my first detailed article regarding my experience while buying my lovely steed TATA PUNCH. Context: I was a proud and satisfied owner of a 2014 model Maruti WagonR until December 2023. The thoughts about changing the car had started coming to my mind as the car was approaching its 10 year milestone. I had intended to keep the car until Jan. 2025 as I would have completed my decade long ownership for the car. The car had clocked in around 86000 Kms. On the ODO and I had started feeling the lack of power to be irritating at times specially when the vehicle was fully loaded. Everything was going smooth until suddenly on 22nd December 2023, My grand father complained of a sudden Pain in his abdomen which became unbearable to the extent that we had to rush him to the Hospital in a span of 30 mins. From the time the pain started. My grand father was immediately moved to ICU and was in a stable condition. On 25th December, while I was going back home from the hospital with my wife, sister and 3 kids (all below 1.5 years of age) the car suddenly died down on the main road. The car would start and then immediately stall. I called up multiple mechanics, RSA, service centers etc. but finally it was my local mechanic who happened to be approx. 1 km away from my location. He came in and towed the vehicle to his garage and diagnosed that the fuel pump was faulty and the root cause was due to a short circuit in the ECM. I could see a burnt out connector pin on the ECU. Finally after spending 1.5 days In the garage the car was ready. The same day My Grand Father Passed away. After all the rituals were over, I was having a chat with my father and gradually the discussion veered towards our car and I proposed him to change the car. He also gave and In-Principle approval to my decision. I was initially inclined to go for a used car and after many hours of rummaging through various websites like Spinny, Cars24, Carwale, Car Trade, Car Dekho, You tube channels such as MCMR etc. I realized that in order to get a decent vehicle, I will have to shell out around 6-7 Lacs and I will have to go for the Loan Option. Meanwhile the above issue cropped up again suddenly after 27 days when I was going to visit a friend in Delhi. This instance shook my confidence in the vehicle and we decided to purchase the new car ASAP. After having this realization, I didnt think it was a rational decision to go for a used car. Then we finally decided that we will go for a new car. The Budget was decided to be max 7 Lacs OTR. Valuation for Old Car: Got appointment scheduled with Cars24 and Spinny for car valuation for my WagonR. The representatives came and did a thorough inspection of the car and went back stating that the price offer will be shared on the App by evening Meanwhile, I also went to various showrooms to check out the Baleno and get the exchange value for the existing car. The quotes received for my WagonR are shared below: Nexa Dealership  1.70 Lacs (Includes 10K Exchange Bonus) TATA Dealership  1.80 Lacs (No Exchange Benefit) Nissan Dealership  1.25 Lacs. (No Exchange Benefit) Hyundai Dealership  1.40 Lacs (No Exchange Benefit) Spinny  1.25 Lacs Cars 24  1.55 Lacs Dealership experience: Nexa  Too arrogant. They took 20 mins. To assign a sales person to attend to us as I mentioned that this might be a cold call. I could sense that the various sales guys were trying to pass on the lead to other person and eventually 1 of the sales guys reluctantly agreed to show us around. After sometime, he handed us over to a senior sales manager who was a bit arrogant and gave us the pricing and loan estimates. TATA  Situated across the road from Nexa, we were politely and promptly attended to by the reception staff and immediately a sales person was appointed to look after our requirements. The sales person  Mr. Deepak Bist gave us full attention and was very patient with all our queries. We enquired for almost the entire lineup until 10 Lacs and after spending close to 3 hours with him wherein he showed us all the cars, explained all their features, did a comparison amongst all the cars within TATA stable and shared the pricing and loan estimates we had made up our mind that Punch is the most suitable car amongst the lot. When I requested a test ride, he mentioned that it will take some time to arrange the same and offered to do a home test ride the next day at a time suitable to us. We agreed to the same as I wanted to have an opinion of all the ladies in the house as well. Nissan  Average experience, it was more transactional and to the point. The test ride was offered promptly while the evaluation for my car was going on. After the test ride got over, I liked the vehicle but the NA engine was lacking the punch. At some point, I thought that my existing WagonR was peppier to drive than the Magnite. The price quoted for the existing car was the last nail in the coffin for them. Hyundai Dealership  Reached the dealership quiet late around 6 PM and the urge to wrap up the day could be seen and felt across the faces of all the showroom staff. Requested them to brief me about Exter and I wanted to sit inside the car for the look and feel. The car was locked and the sales person mentioned that the car cannot be unlocked as the Battery got discharged. When I asked him to show me the Test ride vehicle, he denied the same stating that the vehicle has gone for service and will be available tomorrow. When I asked him for a home test ride, he mentioned that they dont do a Home test ride. I am welcome to the dealership for the same the next day. I could sense that he is in a rush to wrap up the day and go. When asked about the availability for a Base model for Exter, he mentioned that it will be a minimum of 6-8 months. Initial Impression: I had never considered Tata Punch as a contender but after I checked it out, I was surprised with the cabin space and overall look and feel of the car. I dont know why but I had the notion that the Punch was offering the similar space as my existing WagonR. Car booking Experience: As promised, the Tata Sales person called up 1 hour before the scheduled appointment time to confirm the test ride and when I confirmed that everything is on schedule, he came home with a Top Model Punch as the test ride vehicle on time. We all checked out the car and the features, I took a longish test ride of approx. 15 Kms. and was happy with the performance. The entire family loved the size and space of the car and we finally gave the token amount for booking. The Final deal for TATA Punch  Pure  Petrol (Base Model) was negotiated at 6.15 Lacs OTR without registration with a basic zero dep Insurance. Since he was not very sure of BH Series charges. The delivery was promised within 21 days. Also, I had decided that I will exchange my car with TATA dealership and I had requested to handover the car 1 day prior to delivery which they had agreed. Car Delivery Experience: The Sales account manager created and included me in a whatsapp group after the booking and was giving me updates on periodic basis. Once the VIN number was allocated, he promptly shared the same and asked me to start the Loan Procedure. He again contacted me to inform me that the car has arrived and asked me when I can take the delivery. I confirmed that the delivery will be taken on 22nd Feb. 2024. Since I had the Pre approved offer on my bank account, I was told to come around 4 PM to the Dealership for delivery with some basic documents like Aadhar, PAN and 2 Passport photos. The Loan formalities were quickly processed within a couple of hours and I was handed over all the relevant documents. After another 30 mins. During which they explained all the features and functions of the car and the Delivery ceremony the car was handed over to us and we were happily on our way to the nearest petrol bunk for a tank full. Impressions after driving the car for 600 Kms: I will write this section as a question answer post in order to keep the post brief. 1. Hows the familys reaction? Overall the entire family has been very happy with the car and my Twins (1.5 Years) old now recognize the Car Keys and address only TATA Punch as TATA. 2. How do I feel? I am very satisfied with my purchase and satisfied with the performance so far. Having upgraded from a Maruti WagonR I can see a considerable difference in terms of space and engine parameters. 3. Hows the Driving Position? The Driving position is also quite commanding and I can compare it to that of a Brezza. 4. Kitna Deti Hai? Average Fuel Efficiency? In terms of mileage, the car is constantly churning out an average of 14.5-15 KMPL in city conditions 5. Ride quality Everyone in the family is very happy with the ride quality. The large ground clearance definitely helps in crossing the potholes and the humps without bottoming out, the vehicle also seems very planted when driving around 80KMPH (Havent exceeded this limit yet) with negligible body roll. The cabin noise also feels very quiet despite having a 3 Cylinder Engine. Also, many people pointed it out to me that the new Punch (V6.2 Onwards) is very refined and quiet as compared to the previous versions. Overall, I am elated with the purchase and I look forward to having a great ownership experience in future as well. P.S.: The car was finally sold to Cars24 after negotiating a final price of 1.90 Lacs net in account. A few photographs to accompany such a long post. Pardon the poor picture quality as they are taken from phone. More photos will be added in due course.", 15th March 2024,tata-punch,Faridabad,7,61
