0, Omkar , 12:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Citroen C3 Review Citroen C3 Pros • Striking design! Very funky, yet likeable at the same time • Good-looking cabin that is practical too • Fast 1.2L turbo-petrol is genuinely fun-to-drive, while the 1.2L naturally-aspirated engine offers excellent driveability • 6-speed MT is slick and light to operate. Definitely one of the better gearboxes in the segment • Sorted suspension offers a very good ride & handling package • Compact size and light controls are perfect for the urban environment • 10-inch touchscreen with wireless Android Auto & Apple CarPlay is excellent to use • Lots of customization options and accessories to make your car truly unique Citroen C3 Cons • Missing plenty of features = electric ORVM adjustment, IRVM dimmer (not even manual), climate control, rear wiper & defogger, reversing camera, alloy wheels, tachometer! • Just 2 variants at launch (no true top variant) • No automatic transmission on offer - a big miss when ATs are rapidly gaining popularity in India • Quality of cabin materials doesn't feel great; cost-cutting is pretty evident in certain areas • Some ergonomic issues like the placement of rear power window switches, unusable rear headrests… • 1.2L NA petrol’s highway performance is mediocre; 5-speed MT is notchy too • Cabin width makes the interiors suitable for 4 adults, not 5 • Long-term reliability & after-sales service quality are big unknowns; dealer network is tiny This review has been jointly compiled with Vid6639. Thanks to him for the expert observations! Introduction Citroen entered the Indian market in 2021 with a well-engineered premium crossover, the C5 Aircross. Now, the French brand is ready to take on a more mass-market approach with the car that you see here - the C3. Over the past couple of years, we have seen a new segment emerging between the hatchbacks and the compact SUVs. This sub-compact crossover segment has cars like the Nissan Magnite, Renault Kiger and the Tata Punch and if you look at their sales figures, these cars are doing extremely well for themselves. This is the space that Citroen would be focusing on with the C3. However, as we've seen with other cars in this segment, pricing is the key. So it's paramount for Citroen to price the C3 very aggressively to get people talking about the French car brand. Citroen is well aware of the price-conscious Indian car buyer and has focused on high localisation. The C3 is assembled in Thirvallur and the engine & transmission are assembled in Hosur, Tamil Nadu. The made-in-India C3 that's based on PSA's Common Modular Platform, will be exported to ASEAN and African nations as well. Do note that the car is very much different from the C3 based on the PSA PF1 platform on sale in Europe, which is currently in its 3rd generation. Citroen probably should've gone with a different moniker for the made-in-India car just to avoid any confusion. The C3 goes on sale in July and will be available in 2 variants - Live and Feel. There are two engine options to choose from - an 81 BHP, 1.2L naturally-aspirated petrol mated to a 5-speed MT and a 109 BHP turbocharged petrol mated to a 6-speed MT. There is no automatic variant on offer, which IMO, puts the C3 at a big disadvantage against its competition. No one enjoys a manual transmission while being stuck in city traffic no matter how light the clutch is. Considering that the C3 is Citroen's first big bang volume product, the company really should've gone all out with features (more on this later) and transmission options to get the maximum number of people to walk into its showrooms. Citroen C3 Price & Brochure As mentioned earlier, this segment is super price-sensitive and Citroen ought to price the C3 aggressively. The heavy localisation and some of the missing features should allow the French brand to price the car well. We will have to wait for the official launch on July 20, 2022 for the prices. Pre-bookings for the car will open on July 1. You can download the Citroen C3 brochure Citroen C3 Brochure.pdf. Exterior Design & Styling Citroen's design language is unique and far from conventional. This usually polarises opinions, but somehow, the French brand has managed to make it work with the C3. Even for me, who prefers conventional designs, the funky design of the C3 is appealing. Overall dimensions are proportionate. It doesn't feel like a hatchback on stilts, but a well-designed SUV that's shrunken in size. The C3 measures 3,981 mm in length, 1,733 mm (without mirrors) in width and 1,604 mm in height (with roof rails). It has a wheelbase of 2,540 mm which is more than the Tata Punch (2,445 mm) and the Nissan Magnite & Renault Kiger (2,500 mm). There are 4 monotone body colours and 6 dual-tone options to choose from, with the primary colours being Polar White, Zesty Orange, Platinum Grey and Steel Grey. You can choose between a Zesty Orange Roof or a Platinum Grey Roof. There are 3 customization packs too - Zesty Orange, Platinum Grey and Chrome and 2 interior trims (Anodized Orange and Anodized Grey) to further personalise your vehicle. You don't get alloy wheels as standard, but they are available as an optional add-on. Build Quality, Fit & Finish The C3 uses a Common Modular Platform and while it is built to a cost, it doesn't feel cheap. With a kerb weight in the range of 958 kg to 1,035 kg, the C3 is very close to the Tata Punch. There's decent heft to the doors and the bonnet too. However, the tailgate feels a little too light. The doors have a 3-stage opening & closing action and what I specifically appreciate is the fact that you don't have to bang the doors hard. You can just give them a light push and they will shut properly with a satisfactory thud. Overall, the car feels solid and doesn't feel very flimsy or tinny. We did notice that the finishing in some of the areas, especially where plastic is used, wasn't up to the mark at all. For instance, the roof rails on our test car were flimsy, the orange plastic inserts on the car weren't properly stuck, the fog lamps didn't feel secure in their spots and the bumper edges weren't smooth. These may be small things, but they do have a big impact on the buyer's mindset. Wheels & Tyres The Citroen C3 is offered with 15-inch steel wheels as standard with 'Tessera' wheel covers. You can opt for alloy wheels as an option and Citroen has a couple of cool designs as well. Wonder why they just didn't offer the alloys as standard on the top-end variant. The standard tyre size is 195/65 R15 for both, naturally aspirated and turbo petrol variants. These work well for the 81 BHP naturally aspirated engine, but if you are planning for the 109 BHP turbocharged engine, an upgrade to 205s is a must. For some weird reason, Citroen is offering 2 spare wheel options - a 185/65 R15 on a steel wheel in the turbo-petrol variant and a 165/80 R14 on a steel wheel in the naturally aspirated variant. Both of these have a speed limit of 80 km/h. Ground Clearance The C3 has an unladen ground clearance of 180 mm, which is sufficient for Indian road conditions. For reference, the Tata Punch has a GC of 190 mm and the Renault Kiger and Nissan Magnite have a GC of 205 mm. Maintenance Being a new brand in India, Citroen is working on providing good service for this car that's going to be targeting the mass market. This means that the spare parts will need to be affordable and easily available too. Citroen's plans for providing better service to its customers look good on paper with facilities like virtual remote diagnosis, periodic service and maintenance with pickup and drop facilities, 180-minute RSA guarantee, remote service job card opening, service cost estimator on the website, genuine spare parts availability in 24 hours and service on wheels to name a few. We will wait for ownership reports of BHPians for the final verdict. Safety The Citroen C3 isn't feature-packed and the list of safety features is very basic. It has dual airbags, ABS, reverse parking sensors, speed-sensitive auto door lock and seatbelt reminder for driver and passenger. What you miss out on (compared to the competition) are adjustable headrests in the front and rear, ISOFIX child seat anchors, side airbags and a reverse parking camera.", 15th June 2022,citroen-c3,Mumbai,"1,737","21,011"
1, Omkar , 12:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Interior Cabin Design & Quality Spend some time in the cabin of the C3 and you will start having mixed feelings about the car. There are some very likeable bits and you will appreciate the thought that's gone into it. But then, there are areas where you just can tell that Citroen could've easily done so much better. Let's start with the likeable part, which is the design. You have an all-black dashboard with the option of the Orange / Grey accents (depending on your car's exterior body / roof colours). Our test car had orange accents and honestly, they don't look too flashy in person. In fact, if you like the way the car looks on the outside, there's a high chance you will like the interiors too. Bits like the air-con vents (central and side) have a very nice and intricate design. You'll find some well-placed brushed silver accents on the door handles, gear knob housing and at the base of the flat-bottom steering wheel that looks good too. There are no soft-touch plastics here, which is expected, but some fabric inserts would've been nice. Now, to the part that's not so great - the quality of materials used. Simply put, the quality in some areas is average. For instance, the plastics used for the air vents, a/c control knobs and some of the other switches just don't feel that great. The steering wheel and the buttons on it, surprisingly, feel very nice and sturdy to operate. Space & Comfort The C3 has the longest wheelbase in its segment and this definitely works in its favour when it comes to the interior space. That said, the cabin is best suited for 4 adults and not 5. The higher seating position (about 100 mm more than the conventional hatchback) helps in ingress and egress. The fabric-upholstered seats are, surprisingly, very good. They're body-hugging and the cushioning is softer in the central part (where your bottom and lower back would be) and slightly firmer on the ends. There's good under-thigh support and side support to keep you comfortable on the road. Driving Position & Ergonomics The driver seat is height adjustable and has a good travel range too. The steering is adjustable for height which means finding a comfortable driving position shouldn't be a problem for most people. At 5'10"" with my slightly laid-back driving position, I could get comfortable quite easily. However, Vid6639 (6'1""), just wasn't comfortable with the distance to the steering wheel after adjusting the seat for pedal reach and the backrest set for a laid-back driving position. He had to make the backrest more upright. He sorely missed the telescopic adjustment. While driving you get a clear view of the road ahead. Under direct sunlight though, reflections from the dashboard can be distracting. What's better is that you will also be able to see the bonnet creases on the sides, which will be appreciated by many drivers. The side visibility is alright, but the rear visibility is just terrible (like most modern cars). What makes matters worse is that you don't even get a reversing camera in the car and will have to depend on the sensors alone. The C-pillars are pretty thick and you will need to be careful of the big blind spots that they create. While driving, you'll notice that the gear lever is at a perfect height and quite close to the steering wheel. This feels very sporty when you are pushing the car down some twisty roads and shifting through the gears quickly. Other controls like the steering mounted buttons, stalks, air-con controls, etc. are well within reach. The only oddballs here are the rear power window controls, which are placed in between the front seats. This is uncomfortable for the rear passengers as they have to bend and reach for them, which is even more irritating while the car is moving and they have their seatbelts on. Cabin Storage There's a decent amount of storage space in the C3's cabin. All the door pockets can hold 1-liter bottles and you get a well-sized glovebox with additional storage spaces on the lid. In the center console, you get a phone tray below which, you have an additional storage area and a couple of cupholders. There's a small cubbyhole below the handbrake for keeping loose change and another storage area in between the front seats for the rear passengers to use. The front seats have deep seatback pockets for the rear passengers to keep stuff. Air-Conditioning The C3's air-conditioner worked very well on a hot and humid day in Goa. The cabin was cooled quickly even after we'd parked the C3 in the hot sun for a while. There are no rear air-con vents, but the smaller cabin size means that the rear passengers won't complain. The only gripe is that there's no climate control on offer and you get only a manual HVAC unit. Also, after using the air-con at full blast for some time, we found that there was a lot of condensation around the central air vents. Features Unique & Noteworthy Features Features are super important in a market like India. A feature-packed car surely draws people into the showrooms. This is where, IMHO, Citroen has goofed up big time. A quick look at the brochure and you will clearly see that the C3 is nowhere close to its competitors. Sure, the French manufacturer can justify this by saying that features can be added at any time, but first impressions matter a lot in the Indian market. We've seen below average cars with great features do unimaginable volumes and we've also seen great cars that lack features just tank on arrival. That's just how the Indian market is. The only noteworthy feature in the C3 is the 10-inch touchscreen infotainment unit with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. No matter the segment, people have come to expect some basic features from a car, especially in its top-end variant. Here are some of the basic features that should've been included in the C3 - alloy wheels, projector headlamps, rear window wiper, rear defogger, request sensor on front doors, engine start/stop button, manual / auto-dimming IRVM, electric adjustment for ORVMs, climate control, reversing camera, adjustable front and rear headrests, better digital instrument cluster with tachometer, grab handle for the front passenger side, a boot lamp and an audible warning when reverse gear is engaged. Some of the noteworthy features that the competitors offer include stuff like wireless charging, 360-degree cameras, drive modes, a fully digital instrument cluster, hill start assist, traction control, LED projector headlamps, rear air-con vents, cruise control, auto headlamps and rain-sensing wipers. Audio System & Sound Quality The 10-inch touchscreen infotainment system with 4 speakers is offered only on the Feel variant. The two tweeter slots on the A-pillars are blank for now. Citroen might fill them later. The touchscreen gets wireless Android Auto and Apple Carplay connectivity and it's pretty seamless to connect. In terms of usability, the touchscreen is very responsive and doesn't have lag. Even the display is crisp and the colour scheme is pleasant. Listening to music on the 4-speaker system is just about alright. The sound quality is average and very bass-heavy. Rear Passengers Rear Seat Comfort & Space The rear doors open wide and the higher ride height helps ingress & egress. There's a good amount of space on offer and I (5'10"") could sit behind my driving position comfortably. There's a decent amount of legroom and headroom. Vid6639 (6'1"") had just enough space to sit behind his driving position. The cabin's width is limited and good for two adults and a child at best. Seating 3 healthy adults will be tight. The backrest is slightly upright, but not set at an uncomfortable angle. Just like the front seats, the rear seat cushioning is also softer in the middle and slightly firm towards the ends. However, the bench is pretty much flat and there are no contours to give you that additional side support. The under-thigh support is good though. Fixed headrests are uncomfortable for taller passengers as the headrests poke the nape area. There's no center armrest, nor do you get rear air-con vents. You do, however, get two USB charging ports. Boot Space The C3 has boot space of 315 liters. While it is useable and sufficient for a family outing, it must be remembered that it is among the smallest in its segment. For reference, the Tata Punch has boot space of 366 liters, Nissan Magnite 336 litres and the Renault Kiger has a massive 405-liter boot. You get two bag hooks with a maximum load capacity of 3 kg, but, there's no boot lamp provided.", 15th June 2022,citroen-c3,Mumbai,"1,737","21,011"
2, Omkar , 12:00 ,Team-BHP Support,"Driving the Citroen C3 1.2L Turbo-Petrol MT 1.2L turbo-petrol engine makes 109 BHP @ 5,500 rpm and 190 Nm @ 1,750 rpm: The C3 is powered by a 1.2L turbo-petrol engine belonging to Citroen's EB family of engines. This straight 3-cylinder unit is mated to a 6-speed manual transmission and puts out a strong 109 BHP and 190 Nm. These numbers are easily the best in the segment and when you consider the car's kerb weight of 1,035 kg, the power-to-weight ratio & torque-to-weight ratio are a whopping 105 BHP/ton & 184 Nm/ton. To put these figures into perspective, it's higher than the Hyundai Grand i10 Nios Turbo Petrol (101 BHP/ton & 176 Nm/ton), which is a very quick hatchback. So, when we describe this C3 turbo-petrol as a fun-to-drive car, we really mean it. Start the engine by pressing the clutch and turning the key. The C3 moves off the line smoothly. Throttle response is good too. Driving about at city speeds, the car feels smooth despite the high power output (no jerkiness). Good driveability is the key here and the C3 clears the second gear speed breaker test easily. What you need to be careful of is the anti-stall feature here. While this is a good feature to have, drop your speed too low for a speed breaker in 2nd gear and the car will accelerate to keep the engine from stalling. This caught us off-guard on a couple of instances. Turbo lag is well masked and you don't feel that the car is struggling at low revs. Given the high torque produced by this motor and the fact that peak torque comes in early @ 1,750 rpm, you have a good bottom end as well as a punchy mid-range. This means you can actually get away with being in a higher gear at low speed. We were on a steepish incline in 3rd gear with speedometer reading ~25 km/h and on pressing the accelerator, the car got up to speed without even a hint of getting bogged down. This turbo-petrol is a really strong performer. Bury the throttle and you will love the way this car lunges forward when the turbo kicks in. The second and third gears are tall enough for you to nip through the city traffic quickly. All this combined with a small footprint and light steering makes the C3 very nimble to drive around in the city. Out on the highway, the C3's performance remains strong. This is where you can use the mid-range very well. You'll be surprised how easy it is to overtake on the highways with this turbo-petrol engine. If you have the budget, this is definitely the engine to choose over the naturally aspirated one. However, while the engine has a good bottom end and punchy mid-range, like most turbo-petrols, the power dies down in the top end. The gear ratios are spread out nicely for you to use the powerband efficiently. You can push the car in 3rd or 4th gears when in the mood for some fun or just slot it into 6th and cruise comfortably at 100-120 km/h. Shift down to 5th for a comfortable overtake or to 4th for a quicker one. It's too bad the C3's instrument cluster doesn't have a tachometer, and you will be dependent on the engine sound for your shifts. But spend some time with the car and you will be able to enjoy this pocket rocket thoroughly. The accelerator pedal needs a special mention for its fine tuning. It has a progressive feel to it and isn't snappy, which allows you to drive smoothly. The 6-speed manual transmission is slick to operate and much nicer than the notchy Renault-Nissan 5-speed unit. We appreciate the fact that Citroen gave a different gearbox for this turbo-petrol and did not use the 5-speed MT from the naturally aspirated variant. This gearbox compliments the engine very well and just elevates the driving experience multifold. The throws are smooth and sure-slotting. Vid6639 especially liked its nice, faint and reassuring audible click when shifting. Moving through the gears is a pleasant experience, but we noticed a whine in the 2nd gear. It's not present in any other gear. While most people won't notice it, keen-eared BHPians surely will. The clutch is light and the travel range isn't too long, but we found the bite point to be a bit too low, which means the car takes off as soon as you start lifting your foot off the clutch. Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH) At idle, the turbo petrol is surprisingly silent and the typical 3-cylinder vibrations are masked quite well. There's not much noise too and the cabin is pretty silent. While driving around calmly, the engine sound doesn't intrude into the cabin. However, revv the engine hard and you'll hear the engine a lot more in the cabin. Unfortunately, the engine note is not something enthusiasts or regular folk will like. It sounds more strained than sporty at high revs, which is sad as this motor likes being revved hard. At highway speeds, wind noise is kept at a minimum, but road noise and tyre noise do creep into the cabin. Mileage & Fuel Economy As we are already aware, turbo-petrols are sensitive to throttle input and you will be visiting the fuel station more often if you have a heavy foot. But drive sedately and you should see some acceptable FE figures. The C3 turbo-petrol's ARAI-certified fuel efficiency is 19.4 km/l which is at par with the competition. The turbocharger is placed on the front of the engine and you also have a cold air intake: Vertically mounted intercooler is placed next to the radiator: The bonnet gets insulation underneath and helps keep the noise levels low: Driving the Citroen C3 1.2L Petrol MT The 1.2L naturally aspirated petrol engine makes 81 BHP @ 5,750 rpm and 115 Nm @ 3,750 rpm: While the turbo-petrol engine is for people who enjoy performance, the naturally aspirated unit is for those who are conscious of the price and fuel efficiency. The C3's naturally aspirated engine also belongs to the same EB family of Citroen engines and is mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. The powertrain puts out a decent 81 BHP and 115. These numbers are very much comparable to the 1.2L Tata Punch (85 BHP & 113 Nm). Start moving and you will realise that the city driveablity is good and the car feels very user-friendly at slow speeds. The highlight of this engine is its driveability and not the power on tap. You have enough grunt at the lower end of the power band to move about in the city comfortably. Going over a speed breaker in 2nd gear isn't an issue at all. Given the relaxed nature of the engine, I found myself upshifting to higher gears subconsciously, to extract more fuel efficiency on the narrow roads of Goa. Although relaxed, you will get around in the city comfortably with few gear changes. Sedate drivers will appreciate this motor very much. If you do need to close a gap in traffic or make a quick overtake, you will have to drop down a gear or two and the C3 will get by just fine. In a broader perspective, the performance is very much acceptable in the city, where you would be driving at under 80 km/h. The average performance of this engine is evident on the highways as well. It takes its own sweet time to reach triple digit speeds and beyond 100 km/h, there's not much to extract from the engine. Cruising at 100 km/h is where the engine is in its comfort zone. Mid range performance isn't bad, but just about satisfactory. But unlike the turbo-petrol, the power doesn't taper off at the top-end. Power delivery is quite linear. Do note that while cruising, overtaking another car that's doing 90-100 km/h will take some planning. What's more, with a car full of passengers and luggage, this will be even more difficult. You will definitely miss the turbo. So, all in all, this engine is best suited for sedate driving. If you really want to extract some performance from it, you will have to be in the power band which, to be honest, is narrow and in the upper reaches of the rev range. This means that you will really need to rev the engine hard. That will lead to the engine noise in the cabin getting too loud (louder than the turbo-petrol) and you'll find yourself easing up on the throttle just to avoid listening to the strained engine note. The 5-speed manual transmission is way different than the 6-speed unit of the turbo-petrol. It's not just the missing 6th gear, it's the shifts as well. There's a notchiness in the gearbox and while the gates are well-defined, it's not as sure-slotting as the 6-speed MT. Even the shifts aren't as smooth and it just doesn't feel that great to use. The clutch is light and very similar to the turbo-petrol car. Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH) The 3-cylinder characteristics of this engine are very much pronounced here. Compared to the turbo-petrol engine, the noise is pretty much the same at low revs. But since naturally aspirated engines usually have a higher redline than turbo-petrols, they get louder too. Do note that the engine mounts are different for both engines, so the vibrations on the naturally aspirated engine are felt more in the cabin. At idle itself, you can feel the vibrations on the steering wheel, gear lever and pedals as well. Mileage & Fuel Economy The ARAI-certified fuel efficiency of the naturally aspirated 1.2L engine is 19.8 km/l, which is just 0.4 km/l more than the turbo-petrol. There's a lot of free space around the engine. The naturally aspirated engine also uses a smaller battery in comparison with the turbo petrol and gets a cold air intake too: Suspension Ride Comfort The C3 comes with a McPherson strut suspension at the front and a twist-beam suspension with coil springs at the rear. Right off the bat, this is a very likeable suspension tune. There's a hint of mild firmness in it, but overall the setup is very compliant. The ride over small potholes and uneven roads in the city is pretty good. The C3 dissipates shocks very evenly over the front and rear which gives you a feeling of gliding over bad roads. Moreover, the suspension works silently too when going over bumps. Large potholes do register themselves in the cabin, but the C3 handles them well. Overall the ride quality is very absorbent. The C3 rides on 15-inch wheels with 195/65 section tyres and the recommended tyre pressure is 32 PSI. You won't really find the need to lower it down as the car rides well in the city and is good on the highways too. Handling & Dynamics This is where the C3 springs a pleasant surprise. With most of the recent cars being either too stiff or too soft, a good all-rounded suspension setup is like a breath of fresh air. The French sure know a thing or two about tuning the suspension just right. Straight-line stability is good for a car in this segment. The passengers will be relaxed and probably won't even know that you're cruising at 120 km/h. The car holds its line nicely in long curves and body roll is well controlled too. Hit an unexpected expansion joint on the curve and the C3 doesn't get unsettled easily. Start pushing the car on twisty roads and you will appreciate the balance of the chassis. The turn-in is sharp and there is little understeer. With the turbo petrol under the hood, you can really enjoy the car with this suspension. Changing directions from one corner to the other also doesn't unsettle the car and the transition is smooth. I found myself carrying about 10-15 km/h more speed into corners on the same stretch of road in Goa compared to the Renault Kiger last year. There's just more confidence that you get in the C3 while truly attacking the corners. The 195/65 R15 OEM tyres will probably be the only thing that will hold you back as they struggle for grip in tight corners. That said, they work just fine with the naturally aspirated engine. Turbo-petrol owners should definitely upsize. Steering The C3's electric power steering is a very user-friendly unit. It's light in the city and most owners will appreciate that. The compact dimensions of the car, light steering and a tight turning radius of 4.98 metres make the C3 very easy to drive in the city. While it does weigh up as you gain speed, we'd have liked it to be more hefty as it still feels light while cruising at 100 km/h on the highway. Enthusiasts won't like the disconnected feeling of the steering and the vagueness in the centre. There's a peculiar behaviour of this steering wheel when you are taking a bend that requires additional steering input mid-corner. The steering is light on the turn-in and when you start increasing the steering input for the second part of the corner, the resistance increases! We'd have liked the steering to be more consistent, which translates to a more predictive drive through the corners. Saying this only because the C3 is otherwise a genuinely fun-to-drive car. Braking The C3 is equipped with disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear. The performance is as expected and the car comes to a halt without much drama. The pedal feel is very progressive and smooth. Interestingly we were told that the braking setup on the turbo-petrol was beefed up to handle the additional power (i.e. bigger disc, drum and booster). However, we didn't feel that much of a difference in terms of braking feel and visually as well, the size of components looked pretty much the same.", 15th June 2022,citroen-c3,Mumbai,"1,737","21,011"
3, Omkar , 12:01 ,Team-BHP Support,"Citroen C3 Exterior Images The C3 doesn't waver too far from Citroen's traditional design language. It's unique and flamboyant in a very French way, but still manages to look good in the conventional sense: Comparatively subtle rear design. The orange accents, however, keep things interesting. The rear does resemble a hatchback slightly, but the black cladding at the bottom gives the illusion of height: The C3 measures 3,981 mm in length, 1,733 mm (without mirrors) in width and 1,604 mm in height (with roof rails) with a wheelbase of 2,540 mm. There's a good amount of cladding on the door and wheel arches to give the car an SUV-like look: The car looks very good in person. With all the creases, it doesn't look boring at all: Overall build quality is satisfactory and while the panel gaps are mostly consistent, finishing in certain areas could've been better: The double Chevron logo is finished in chrome and looks bold. You might notice people on the road trying to figure out which company this car belongs to: The logo extends into LED DRLs on either side. The top LED also houses the turn indicator and the bottom one extends into the headlamp pod. No projector setup here. The simple halogen unit feels very basic: Nice detailing at the end of the LED DRL strip: The split front grille with an air dam at the bottom. The silver faux skid plate-like is a nice touch: Halogen fog lamps get black housings with orange inserts. While this treatment looks nice and funky, on our test car, the inserts were loosely fitted. Even the fog lamps were moving around a lot in their place, i.e. they didn't feel very secure: No underbody protection is offered as standard. You can get engine protection as an accessory and given our conditions, we recommend getting it: Two prominent creases on the bonnet give a muscular look to the car. Check out the fender design - looks super funky, but repairing a simple fender bender is going to be a huge pain for sure. Workshops will be pushing for replacing the fender rather than denting and repairing it for sure: Turn-indicators are basic fender lights: ORVM covers match the roof. They can be either Zesty Orange that you see here or the Platinum Grey: Flap-type door handles look super outdated. The keyhole is located on the door rather than on the door handle: Fake air vent-like insert on the front doors may not be to everyone's liking: Overall glass area is sufficient and lets in enough light in the cabin. The rear occupants will surely miss a quarter glass. Blackened pillars look good. C-pillar is thick: 15-inch steel wheels are shod with 195/65 section Ceat SecuraDrive tyres. The dark grey wheel covers don't look bad and the wheels fill the wheel wells quite nicely too: Here's a look at the alloy wheels that Citroen is offering as an accessory. They look sexy with the Citroen logo hub caps! These should've been offered on the top-end variant: Drum brakes at the rear. Since the wheelbase is long, there's very little rear overhang: Front wheel wells get plastic cladding, while the rear wheel wells get rubberised insulation. While NVH levels are acceptable, road noise does creep into the cabin: There are two roof colours to choose from on the dual-tone variants - Zesty Orange and Platinum Grey. You can also get roof decals in the customization options. Gloss black roof rails are offered only on the Feel variant and the ones on our car weren't secured firmly. Outdated wire antenna sits at the front of the roof section: No LED elements here, but the tail lamps manage to look really good with their 3D-like design. The big double arrow logo finished in black with the Citroen name at the bottom feels like a way to spread brand awareness. I like how the 'C' in C3 is finished in chrome while the '3' is black with a chrome border: No rear wiper or even a defogger. This is just ridiculous! Lower bumper houses reversing sensors and reflectors with orange accents. Look closely and there's a faux skid plate in place here, which is finished in black. If only they'd have painted this in anodized grey like the front, it'd have looked much better: You get a request sensor for the tailgate and two LED lamps for the number plate. It just feels like Citroen has cut costs at the wrong places and splurged in areas that are less important: Turbo-petrol variant gets a 'PureTech' badge on the left of the tailgate. Nothing for the naturally aspirated variant: A French Revolution? The Kiger does feel a tad longer, but the C3 has a longer wheelbase. Just from this picture, you can tell that the C3 is the one that's under-specced here: ", 15th June 2022,citroen-c3,Mumbai,"1,737","21,011"
4, Omkar , 12:01 ,Team-BHP Support,"Citroen C3 Interior Images Just like the exterior, the dashboard design is unique and stands out from the crowd: Flat-bottom steering wheel is nice to hold. It's perfectly sized and the brushed silver element on the bottom spoke looks pretty classy. The right spoke holds buttons to control the volume, activate voice commands, control the telephony features & the source button for music: Steering is adjustable for height but not reach. Given the positioning of the driver's seat and pedals, we wish it had reach adjustment as well. The adjustment lever is pretty rudimentary: Stalks are chunky and feel nice to use. Wiper controls are on the left, while the light controls are on the right. A lane change indicator has been provided: Very basic instrument cluster consists of a digital display with a calculator font that displays information. There's no tachometer, but good to see an engine temperature gauge though: Press the ugly stalk sticking out of the screen to toggle through the odometer, trip meter, average fuel efficiency and distance to empty. There is also have a gear shift indicator that lets you know if you need to upshift or downshift: Side air-con vent is very well-designed. Orange insert surrounds the vent that has a piano black border and the vent itself has silver inserts. While this looks great, it doesn't feel very durable due to the materials used: The fog lamp switch and power window lock button are placed on the right along with a couple of dummies. Notice the manual headlamp leveller below: Doors open pretty wide. Doorpads have an all-black theme with a white pocket area: A look at the door latch and the front power window controls. Interestingly, all 4 power windows have auto-down function: Front door pocket can hold a 1L bottle and some other knick-knacks: The front seats are super comfy and offer very good lateral as well as under-thigh support. Sadly, no adjustable headrests here. See the central part of the seat that has the patterned fabric? This area has a slightly softer compound than the rest of the seat. This feels super comfortable while driving and we appreciate the attention to detail that has gone into the design of these seats: A closer look at the contrast orange stitching on the seat where the two compounds are separated: Driver seat gets height adjustment in the Feel variant: Pedals are well spaced out, but there is no dead pedal. Note the OBD port above the accelerator and the Kwid-like bonnet release (reference image). Also, for some reason, the accelerator pedal in the turbo-petrol variant is smaller... ...than the accelerator pedal in the naturally aspirated variant (most likely different component suppliers). This longer pedal on the NA variant looks like the Bosch unit that Mahindra uses in its cars (XUV700, XUV300, Bolero etc): The ORVM is well sized and you get a good view of the action at the back. The sad part is... ...they get manual adjustment! This is something you can expect in an entry-level hatchback, not a crossover: Another miss is the passenger side grab handle: The IRVM is of a good size and covers the rear windshield completely. Another sad part is that there's no dimming feature, even a manual flick switch! Rearward visibility is limited due to thick C-pillars, rear headrests and the small rear windshield: Center fascia has an uncluttered design with some nicely designed elements: 10-inch touchscreen is easily the highlight of the cabin. Citroen hasn't spared any expense on this unit. It has a high-resolution crisp display with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. You get the usual audio presets to play around with and you can even switch off the display: 4-speaker system is average in terms of performance and is bass-heavy. You'll find slots for tweeters on the A-pillars, but sadly they're blanks as of now. Citroen might fill them later on: Just like the side air-con vents, the central vents have a very nice design too. The knobs in the middle to adjust the direction of the flow also feel good to operate, but overall the materials used don't feel durable: Driving around in Goa's hot and humid climate, the air-con unit kept the cabin cool, but there was quite a lot of condensation around the vents: In our review car, below the touchscreen, there was a slot for a phone holder accessory. However, we were told that this will not be on the cars that will go on sale as they've made changes to the design of the accessory: No climate control, just a manual HVAC unit. The knobs look very basic and the quality of the plastic isn't that great either. There is a USB port on the left and a 12V socket on the right: Below, there is a phone tray that holds a 7-inch phone nicely. There's also an open storage area next to the two cupholders: Sweet-looking gear lever of the turbo-petrol variant with 6 gears. Reverse gear is engaged by pulling the collar upward: 5-speed MT gear lever of the naturally aspirated variant. Orange contrast stitching on the gear boot looks very nice and so does the brushed silver insert at the base: Both these gear knobs have a rectangle-like design element on the sides. Interestingly, the 5-speed MT gear knob has a hole through it while the 6-speed MT doesn't: Handbrake is nicely placed next to the gear lever. The C3 has probably one of the lightest handbrakes around. You can literally pull the handbrake with one finger and it will engage so that the car doesn't roll back on not-so-steep inclines: There's a small storage area below to place coins: Rear power window switches are placed in between the front seats. They not very easy for the front occupants to operate, and neither are they easy for the rear passengers to reach. There's a cupholder at the end of the center console for the rear passengers to use: Dotted pattern on the dashboard looks nice and the contrast orange colour adds a bit of freshness to the design. I prefer this orange colour on the dashboard over the other grey option. Check out the horizontal silver platform below. Unfortunately, this is a purely cosmetic element and you cannot place anything here: Glovebox is decently sized, but there's no illumination or ventilation here. You do get two clips along with a booklet holder on the inside of the lid: Super basic roof light just has On and Off functions. You don't even get the 'Door' option here! Bluetooth mic placed on the side: Dual airbags are standard across both variants: Rear doorpads are also finished in all black. Door pockets can hold a 1L bottle but nothing more than that. No power window buttons here, they're placed in between the front seats: Interestingly, the rear seats are placed 27 mm higher than the front ones. There’s enough legroom for two average-sized adults to sit behind each other. Both front seats also get seatback pockets to keep stuff: Here's Vid6639 (6'1"") seated behind his driving position. He found the legroom to be just enough for him to be comfortable. The headroom was also just enough for him and anyone taller would find his head brushing against the roof. Shorter folks won't have any problems in the back: Here's a look at the legroom for Vidyut sitting behind his driving position and with the front seat pushed all the way forward. There's enough space under the front seats as well to keep your feet: Side occupants get three-point seatbelts and fixed headrests, while the middle passenger has to make do with a lap belt and no headrest. The fixed rear headrests are irritating as they touch the nape area of tall passengers: No rear air-con vents, but you do get two USB charging points in the middle: Well-sized parcel tray with a raised border to keep things from rolling onto the rear seat: Boot space of 315 liters is just about adequate for a family's weekend outing: You can fold down the rear seats to get more cargo space: Surprisingly, the boot floor has thick foam, which is of good quality. Most manufacturers cut costs here by using a basic ply-like material: The spare wheel of the turbo-petrol variant is a 15-inch steel wheel shod with 185/65 section Ceat Stepnee tyre that has a speed limit of 80 km/h. Naturally aspirated variant gets a 14-inch steel wheel with a 165/80 section tyre. Note how the boot floor is fully painted and Citroen hasn't left it by just applying the primer. The steel nut-like thing you see in the centre of the wheel was designed as a centring tool while fitting the spare wheel. But we were told that certain design changes have been made and this tool won't make it to the cars that'll go on sale: Two baggage hooks in the boot with a maximum load capacity of 3kg: Tailgate gets partial cladding. Good to see that there's no exposed wiring here: ", 15th June 2022,citroen-c3,Mumbai,"1,737","21,011"

I just wish that there was a lit more 'oomph factor' overall which is generally expected from French cars.

It has timeless design like European cars. 3. Who needs flashy HID projectors, all LEDs and alloys if perfect Turbo Petrol+GB combination, ride quality and comfort are there, (at budget price)! From the review I think that this car has covered primary aspects and is driver-centric. Being a hatchback from Euro manufacturer can this car provide 70-80% of good driving dynamics like Punto, Polo?

With a kerb weight in the range of 939 kg to 1,035 kg, the C3 is very close to the Tata Punch. There's decent heft to the doors and the bonnet too. However, the tailgate feels a little too light. The doors have a 3-stage opening & closing action and what I specifically appreciate is the fact that you don't have to bang the doors hard. You can just give them a light push and they will shut properly with a satisfactory thud. Overall, the car feels solid and doesn't feel very flimsy or tinny.

We do not want such cars from new manufacturers.I mean, we have Suzuki, Tata, and Hyundai providing us with an endless supply of made-to-cost products. The real game is now in 1020 lakh segment. This one will surely sustain initial success, but it will be for a limited period of time. Soon, sales will decline to a point where Citroën will start packing. I didn't understand their strategy. A C5 is at the highest end of 5-seater crossovers, and a C3 is at the lowest end. Why couldn't they bring the products to the areas where the battle is currently being waged? Probably too scared! Also, I am tired of listening to the sentence ""India is a price-sensitive market."" This makes no sense because every market, or rather, every product on the planet, is price sensitive. Will Americans pay 1 million dollars for a Corolla? Hell No! I think India is more of a brand/reputation-sensitive market rather than being price-sensitive.

13, sunikkat , 13:01 ,Senior - BHPian,"A ver nice review. Like others said it’s a confused strategy - “Missing plenty of features = electric ORVM adjustment, IRVM dimmer (not even manual), climate control, rear wiper & defogger, reversing camera, alloy wheels, tachometer” In general people who buy car in this segment are the ones who are upgrading from budget hatchbacks with lesser features and are looking forward for a feature rich, premium looking CSUV. I feel with these feature cuts, C3 will get perceived as a cheap alternative. Neither Citroen has the brand pull or dealer coverage to pull customers. I am scared this might end up doing < 2k numbers per month. And going by past history of Jeep and Citroen, do not expect the pricing to be very competitive also. So again this might get restricted to few enthusiasts for that 1.2 turbo engines.

My fellow Fiat fans be like: engine, gearbox, suspension and steering feedback is good. We do not need anything else. 3. C3 vs Punch: If priced at comparable levels, people can either choose features (Punch) or a good engine (C3). 4. Lack of some basic features are not pardonable. A top variant with alloys, climate control, electric ORVMs, rear washer and wiper is a must. But then I see a Harrier XE from a segment where providing manually adjustable ORVMs even in a base model is a crime.

But sadly, that didn't fill up the Citroen coffers. Almost every other review blamed it on the poor spec-to-price configuration vs the competition. Goes without saying, for the C3 to be successful in the Tata Punch category, Citroen ought to lace it up with more features and price it ultra-competitively.

The sheer number of omissions + no-auto leaves enough space for three genuine variants. b. Citroen has managed to do the more difficult bit (engine, gb, rq) but surprisingly misses out on the easier ones (features). So if they are serious enough about India ops we can expect these variants within a year. As of now, the top variant should not be over 8.5 otr. c. I am curious about the crash tests. The report suggests a good heft to the doors and bonnets. A score of 4 or more looks very much possible. d. From the pictures, I could assume that the looks of the car grow gradually for people like me who find it a bit more “in-your-face” at the outset. From the pictures, I will like to try out the grey highlights over the orange. This is a bit too loud for me. e. How Citroen reaches out (a meagre 17 dealership now) and manages ASS. Reaching the scale of Renault (518 dealerships) will be the first big target and I don’t see that happening in a year for sure. In conclusion, C3 makes more sense for people looking to have an addition to their fleet. For the majority of 1 car households, C3 will remain a second option at least for now. Unlike variants that miss out on engine-gb combo, the omissions in C3 are deal breakers for many. Citroen will look to add those three variants ASAP + price it correctly failing which C3 will sink without a trace. To be honest, we need more C3 with that engine-gb-rq combo and hope to see the true top-end soon. Cheers", 15th June 2022,citroen-c3,Kolkata,90,156

Today even a well established company like Tata is struggling to increase its service network given its strong portfolio of vehicles on offer. 2. The brand itself. Citroen is not Hyundai/Tata/Maruti period. It is no Ford/VW either. Citroen will have to work on a war foot basis to address this brand awareness and reputation. 3.

This is again a challenging part that needs to be addressed by its management. 4. C3 - the product itself.

Its now a value conscious market. You cant just make a cheap car and undercut the rivals and think it will do wonders. You need to show me value for money even if its priced same or above its competition but it should be worth it. Think of how KIA / MG entered the market. Atleast 3-4 full front page ads in the newspaper, visible sign boards and heavy investments in digital marketing, showrooms coming up all across the country. Everyone knew these brands and their imminent products. And then the product itself. Seltos was not set out to undercut all its competition and win customers because it was the cheapest. But they gave multitude of engine options, gearbox options, trims, feature list that would shame a X1 / GLA and a sorted and well engineered product. Same for Hector. Now think of C3, while they may have the engineering part of it sorted, but does that sell in itself?

76, Vid6639 , 01:04 ,Team-BHP Support,"Omkar and me had a lot of fun with the C3 in Goa. There's a few interesting points. - We were supposed to swap cars with another media publication. First half would be Turbo and second half NA for us. We were getting calls from the other publication to swap. when we reached the hotel back from driving the turbo, all the NA cars were already back but nobody wanted to hand over the turbos. lol. The journos who got the NA car were desperate to swap and take the turbo but no journo with the turbo was in a hurry to return it back. - The car did get a lot of attention from Punch, Ignis and other hatch back owners in Goa. Rare to see a compact hatch get attention on road. - The turbo was an absolute hoot to drive and the gearbox shift action is something that I have never experienced so slick from segments higher. - The dynamics are perfect. It's rare to see a car so perfectly tuned that rides well and you can lean into it decently well in corners. - I don't care much for the gimmicky features like 360 cam, wireless charging, sunroof etc but there needs to be a variant with: 1. manual day/night mirror 2. rear defogger with wiper 3. steering telescopic adjust 4. tachometer 5. electric orvm adjust 6. reverse camera (screen resolution can easily be the benchmark) 7. projector headlights not the silly H4 reflector They don't need to offer keyless go with start/stop, alloy wheels can remain optional at dealer level, engine guard can be optional at dealer level, doesnt need a sunroof but the above 7 features are a must if they want to attract buyers to the showroom. They have the best mechanical package but they stopped half way and didn't give it what it needs to match that chasis and engine. I hope they price it at a shockingly low price with the omissions else Au revoir Citroen. They can add features later but why not do what Kia did and what Ford did. Leave it up to the buyers by giving them the options. Once a product is declared a dud no amount of features additions can help them recover. The comments on the thread cement this point and I hope Citroen is reading.

I've never in my entire life seen a car with rear power windows in the middle like that. I've seen cars like the santro place front switches in the middle, and that's just a mild inconvenience, placing the rear ones there is a major one AFAIC. If they really loved centrally placed switches then they could've shifted all four of them to the middle. Very strange choice. And they've given two usb ports at the rear, that could've been one. They could've given lesser quality boot floor covers, I don't think anybody even cares about them, they could've given a slightly smaller touchscreen with wires Android auto instead. Should've learnt from the masters of cost cutting, Hyundai - cut costs where the eye doesn't reach much. I sincerely hope they add in some sort of a basic accessory pack like the altroz which includes all the basic features which were left out - electrically adjustable and foldable ORVMs, rear wiper and washer, tachometer, manual/auto dimming irvms, climate control, proper placement for rear power window switches, 2 tweeter addition etc. Like Vid said, i honestly do not care about 360 degree cameras, wireless Android auto, big pano sunroof, keyless sensor based entry, push button start etc etc etc couldn't care less, but manual ORVMs and irvms are a turn off. Over the years, I've gotten used to electrically folding mirrors and adjusting them from one place and I'm totally not interested in stretching out to the passenger side like some yoga move to fold the ORVM/adjust it. P.S. Judging from the reviews everywhere online, it's a good car in that it gets the main things right - engine, overall build quality, transmission, ride and handling.

I have a feeling Citroen might be offering a lot of the ""essential"" features as dealer accessories to on-board new dealerships. After the lukewarm (or cold) response to the C5 Aircross, new dealers may not have seen the incentive to partner. Pricing will be key for this car and will eventually determine whether it truly is value-for-money or not. They really have to justify the cost-cutting and then I believe we can see them move units.

Many internet reports are suggesting notchy gearshifts. Is our opinion that the shifts are better than the slick Polo as well. Also how is the Turbo refinement in comparison with the 1.2 K series which is the segment benchmark. On a side note, Rapid Rider was better loaded than this and priced 7.5 ex-showroom just in 2020 (we understand how prices have risen in last 2 years) even after considering additional taxes for 4+ m size. Hope Citroen does not cross this limit. The feature lack is too much like you have mentioned in your earlier post. Pricing would also be dependent on what Citroen has set targets considering < 20-30 dealerships. Our wish is to see a Magnite or XUV700 like pricing at launch. But Citroen should use this opportunity to cement themselves in the Indian market. Just shock us in a good way. Nexon is 9 and 10 lakhs OTR Mumbai with load more features and a proven safety.

We drove both the Naturally Aspirated and Turbo versions. I have only a few points to make as a set of very short first impressions. 1. The driving position, headroom, back support, view and under thigh support are first class. 2. The steering feel is excellent (perhaps just a tad light but thats amazing when the car is at a standstill and one has to maneuvre) 3. The ride comfort over any sort of surface is absolutely magical. One doesnt feel any of the undulations and bumps and broken surfaces. And this applies to both front and rear seats. 4. The turning radius is amazing. 5. The boot space is more than adequate. 6. While the Turbo is nice and punchy and responsive, I appreciate the Naturally Aspirated version as well - it isnt a terrible laggard in that sense especially considering that these are primarily going to be city use cars. 7. The gears are soft and smooth shifting if a trifle tall-ish and I quite enjoyed chucking the little car about. 8. Am appreciative of the handling, though tall it doesnt feel top heavy. 9. The manual adjusting Outside mirrors are ok for a tall person but bot for a small built person. Pricing and all is a bit off centre. And while the concept of offering everything as an accessory is a good idea, they ought to have read India better- we want everything included at the best price even to the extent of demanding free steering cover and footmats and all, so they are going to have to surmount these mind set obstacles. And they really ought to have offered an AT variant, considering the tectonic shift that our market is experiencing towards AT.

106, arjab , 16:02 ,Senior - BHPian,"Me & wifey were walking down Park Street, Calcutta, to pick up our daughter from school, when we popped into the Citroen showroom as we had some time to kill before the school gave over. There was a solo White & Orange C3, naturally aspirated version, on display. First impressions: 1. Decent build quality, uniform fit, finish, gap & flush. Even paint quality with no bubbling or ""orange-peel"" effects anywhere. I especially keep a keen eye at the potential slight colour mismatch between the surface of the plastic bumper and the sheet metal fender. In this car that was not visible at all. 2. Excellent ingress and egress. Particularly at the front. It's almost a ""walk in - walk-out"" door aperture design. The front seats look very basic but offer very good support, particularly under - thigh. The bolstering and lower lumbar support also felt spot on. This was endorsed by the Miss'us too, (and she's a long time sufferer of low back pain) The Great Indian Automotive Media and The Great Indian Auto Enthusiast's brigade are slaughtering Citoen for having fitted ""flap""-type Outer door handles. To my feeble mind and jurassic perceptions, the handles felt perfectly fitted, engaged and disengaged with a positive sounding click and worked flawlessly. 3. Liked the cabin width and the horizontal couple distance between driver and passenger. You will not bang elbows or shoulders with your passenger. 4. Large footwells and well spaced out A,B,C pedals. People with large boots should not have an issue. 5. Excellent visibility with manageable blind spots around the ""A""-pillar. 6. The manually adjustable outside door mirrors are wide and do their intended task well. 7. Rear seat is commodious, has very good under-thigh support and the cushioning is neither too soft or too hard. Both the front seats get seatback pockets for rear seat passengers to store things. The daylight opening, DLO, at the rear is sufficiently large enough and will not induce claustrophobic feelings to rear seat occupants. 8. Boot looked fairly large with good enough space to take in a weekend's luggage for a family of three / four people. The shape of the boot is very practical to stuff things in. 9. In the naturally aspirated version: the engine bay looked to have been designed to take in much larger engines. Based on a fleeting visual check: the engine mounts looked pretty hefty and overengineered for a 1.2 Litre's engine's weight. 10. The vehicle has short overhangs and a healthy ground clearance. It should not be an issue driving the C3 over broken Indian roads. 11. The floor mats and the boot mat - all available as genuine accessories looked and felt nice and hardy. What could have been improved 1. Addition of rear wash wipe. The upright rear windscreen will gather a lot of muck, particularly in the rains. From what i saw the rear windscreen ""frit"" area is package protected for a rear wash-wipe system integration. Citroen for some reason has omitted it. Does not even have an option. 2. Electrically adjustable outside rear view mirrors. It is required because the cabin is wide and one has to lean over a bit too much to manually adjust the mirrors. Also the stability of the mirror surface in the case of an electrically adjustable mirror is greater and the mirror does not ""shift"" from its ""user - set"" position that frequently compared to a manually adjustable mirror. 3. A simple, flick lever day-night inside rear view mirror. Overall I like the car. It is simple, looks elegant, is very comfortable to sit in and feels refreshingly nice and simple. Personally I am a person who like to own well performing, good handling vehicles which will age well over time. I do not need button clad steering wheels, huge television like displays, seats that jiggle and wiggle your nether regions before spewing streams of air; and i certainly do not want ""talking cars"" and that too in a ludicrous, nasal twang as to what it would and would not do to light up that bulb in your living room!

The 60+ gentleman left within 2 minutes when he got to know that there was no automatic transmission option available. He left a nice comment to the sales advisor - you can only sell what the company offers. 3. One booking was made by a couple - their first car most likely. The sales advisor mentioned that they had 65 bookings to date. 4. Indicative price that the sales advisors were mentioning was between 6.25 Lakhs to 9.75 Lakhs OTR. Interestingly between the two sales advisors, there was a 50k difference in prices mentioned. 5.

108, skpprabhu , 11:12 ,BHPian,"I was at the unveil event in one of their Bangalore dealership on 3rd July and also took a test drive of the turbo petrol. As a brand it looks more promising and commited towards Indian market. Their showroom was good and the staffs was very professional and well equipped. I personally like the approach what Citroen has taken to focus more on mechanicals rather than features. Features can be added anytime in the product lifecycle and as per their statement the features are included/omitted based on the user survey. To some extend I feel it to be correct, let me evaluate some features based on my usage. 1. Electrically adjustable ORVM: It is convenient but how many times do I use it, In my current vehicle I use it once in 3 months or 6 months just to make sure the motor is not jammed.

The other use case, which was also pointed out by another BHP-ian, is interesting to me. You are basically using it as a troubleshooting tool. IMO, the engine noise should tell you when the RPM is abnormal for a gear. Tachometer can tell you how abnormal it is though. Anyway, I am not against having a Tachometer.

Even when taking a tight turn it is useful to see if you're running over a kerb or concrete slab or something.

Sure, keep the design different for higher variants to make them more appealing. They also offer advantages, even if minor, in fuel efficiency and ride comfort. 5. Adjustable headrests: Depends on a lot of factors (height, size of your head, how you sit etc) Just give that damn option and leave it to the consumer on how to use it.

141, arjab , 14:54 ,Senior - BHPian,"Yesterday, in Calcutta, I test drove the C3 Turbo for a long time, in a mix of maddening urban traffic and some open roads. Being an existing owner of a Nexon Turbo petrol, a Tiago petrol and a first gen G13B Swift I could make a decent subjective assessment of the little Citroen. Needless to say, my views are entirely my own. Thought of sharing them on the forum, in case it helps anyone. Engine & Driveability: For a 3 cylinder direct injection turbo, the unit is rather smooth. On cold start there is a slight hint of vibration percolating through the steering wheel rim, which smoothens out as soon as the temperature gauge touches its second notch. I do not know the exact specifications, but to me it felt that for the Turbo at least, Citroen must be using a contra-rotating balancer shaft or a dual-mass flywheel to dampen out inherent ""unbalanced"" nature of any three cylinder unit. I would say this powertrain is up there in terms of refinement with the now forgotten, but brilliant 1.0 litre EcoBoost from Ford which powered their Ecosport. The indirect injection 1.2 Turbo petrol of Nexon and the same engine in its naturally aspirated version, which powers the Tiago is agricultural in comparison. The engine is very tractable in the low and mid ranges. Turbo boost starts building up, from what i guessed below 2000rpm, maybe somewhere in the region of 1700-1900 rpm, equating to roughly 24kmph in 3rd gear. The car pulls seamlessly, without any hiccough, velocity building up strongly after 45kmph and you can ride that creamy, torque wave right up to the soft revv limiter, which from the engine note, i guessed it would be somewhere in the region of 5500 - 5800 rpm. Citroen has calibrated the ECU and the fueling very nicely. There are absolutely no jerks at low to very low engine revolutions. The vehicle gathers momentum effortlessly without any hesitation even when you are lugging the car at low speeds in a high gear. The gear ratios are well judged and evenly spaced out. The shift action feels very nice and the gearshift lever has a smooth ""mechanical"" feel with well judged detents ensuring you never experience a ""mis-shift"". 3rd gear is very flexible. I dropped to as low as 22kmph in 3rd gear, then floored the accelerator and the little Gaul responded smartly, boost building up from 35kmph onwards in one linear flow. The Tata 1.2 turbo is simply outwitted in this department. The erstwhile Ford Ecoboost 1-litre also loses out to the Citroen's powerplant in the low end tractability stakes. Suspension, Ride and Handling As everyone now knows, the C3's suspension setup looks most ordinary on paper. From what i could infer, Citroen has waved its magic wand and used its decades of experience in suspension tuning by doing a stellar job in calibrating the damper rebound control valving. When you hit an undulation the C3 soaks it up like a sponge and then when the wheel is ""released"" it is done in a very nice and compliant way so that there are no unpleasant thuds and thunks with the lower control arms hitting the bump stops on full ""release"". From a subjective point, the suspension travel felt greater compared to other competing models. The Citroen has progressive rate coil springs. Add a long travel suspension, tall 65-aspect ratio tyres, finely tuned seat cushioning and nicely calibrated dampers and you have a level of ride comfort which is truly impressive for a car in its segment. The C3 will remind you of the original Renault Duster's ride when it was launched and if you are an old codger like me , it will remind you of the long gone Peugeot 309's superlative ride comfort. The steering is nicely calibrated. It has a smooth, self centering action and is commendably weighted. It is not bristling with feel, like say a Tata altroz's steering but the helm has very little slack in the ""on-centre"" position. What is advantageous is the compact steering wheel diameter and the relatively less number of turns, lock - to - lock, which gives the car an added dimension of agility. Features, space and comfort I belong to the Jurassic era of motorists when driving meant straight-forward simple mechanicals residing in a well tuned chassis chained to a manual gearbox - the setup which you can exploit the whole day and have a lot of fun. I always believed that: forget top speed; make an ordinary hatch handle 20% better and you will reach your destination 20% faster. and Citroen has done that i feel. This car is not for the ""Gen Z"" digital brigade. It does not have half the things in terms of features, that its Japanese or Korean equivalent has. It will not appeal to a considerable percentage of the car buying populace. But to that minority of us that still love driving and pine for a nice, mechanical connect with the car, the Citroen hits the spot The seats are excellent. Supportive all around with variable density cushioning it should ensure comfortable motoring for many hours. The combination switches feel good to operate and most buttons, knobs and levers do their job with a rustic yet positive feel. Yes, I have booked one.

From a personal point of view, I would say, the C3's ride quality is superior to anything that is on offer in the compact SUV segment. The Nexon, Tiago and Punch are stiff-kneed in comparison lacking the pliancy of the C3's setup. The Citroen has a very nice fluency in bump absorption, without being wallowy or bouncy. It's a combination, I feel, of the long suspension travel and some very cleverly tuned damper valve rates. The springs are conventional steel, but are progressive rate coils, (similar to the Fiat Uno & Fiat Palio). The 65 aspect ratio tyres also provide an additional, secondary level of bump absorption that makes the overall ride that bit more plush.", 17th July 2022,citroen-c3,MAA/CCU,"1,401","5,297"

One query - since you mentioned you own a Nexon as well, would you be able to share your thoughts on space comparison between the two? Especially back seat & boot. The Nexon rear seat is wider compared to the C3. Fitting three people at the rear in a Nexon is not an issue. In the C3 it will be a snug fit.. The seating position in the C3, I felt was better, because of the ""multiplex"" or ""theatre"" style seating configuration, where the rear seats are placed a bit higher than the front seats. This gives a very nice view to the rear seat passengers, be it the view through the front windscreen or the side windows. This ""feeling of airiness"" will be appreciated by people who suffer from motion sickness. The Nexon's seats are ""sunken - in"" with decent support. Also the Nexon rear seat ambience feels more hemmed in due to the sharply rising window line and the swooping down rear roof line. The floor height of the Citroen is lower compared to the Nexon. Therefore rear ingress and egress is better. But the biggest difference at the rear is due to the suspension setup of the respective cars. Due to its more stiffer setup, rear seat passengers feel more of potholes, ruts, ditches and ridges in the Nexon. A collateral damage of this firm setup is a fair bit of ""head-toss"" of the rear passengers when going over broken stretches. The Citroen's rear suspension setup is softer, the ride feels more plush and mature and the body control on the dampers' rebound stroke is very impressive. You are tossed around less and the ride over rutted surfaces do not feel as fidgety & jumpy as the Tata's. Overall the C3 is better suited for rear passenger comfort. Boot space is quite close for both the cars. The wider Nexon may have the more commodious boot but the sharply, sloping rear hatch windscreen rake angle often hits the top edge of large suitcases, especially when kept upright. The C3 has a more upright rear hatch and rear windscreen rake angle. Tall luggage fouls less. The boot is nicely shaped as well with less.intrusive wheel wells & suspension turrets. Honestly, very little to separate the two cars, in terms of.outright luggage carrying capacity!", 18th July 2022,citroen-c3,MAA/CCU,"1,401","5,297"

The suspension setup is one of the best i have seen in compact SUVs and hatchbacks. It is a very good car when it comes to performance and drivability, but it does lack many of the necessary features. I would be okay with losing out on some of the nice to have features, but the manual ORVM adjustments, no adjustable headrests, positioning of the rear power window switches, no rear defogger, and the overall plastic quality doesn't seem to justify the price tag.

A friend of mine got a Polo 1.0 TSI Highline plus manual for that price with all the goodies, which is a way superior car when it comes to performance or quality of materials used (The C3 is better only in space and rear seat comfort).

This is because the 1.2 turbo Feel variant is not a true top-end of C3. Compared with the competition, around one dozen features are missing from this variant, some of which are deal breakers in 2022. In order to accommodate these features + an auto gb the true top end will touch the ~11 mark otr if and when it is launched. Now, what does a customer get for 11 lakhs? a 104/ tonne power to weight ratio, a 185 nm/ tonne torque to weight ratio, stellar ride quality, precise gear slot, compactness, and good maneuverability. The only big question that remains is the safety quotient. Lastly but most importantly, Citroen's penetration in the market. Even when the top end is launched, I don't see C3 selling even in moderate numbers as it has an extremely small footprint across the country right now. So success for Citroen will mean how quickly it can reach out across the length and breadth of the country. Till that time, C3 turbo will be a rare sight on our roads making it even more appealing to the existing owners. Should I buy a C3 now? If I were in the market for a car, C3 ticks most of the boxes.

Also, I might get behind the no rear wash and wipe funda but what the hell man! Couldn't they include a damn defogger on that rear windshield. Another thing, if the car has so many customization options, I would guess this is targeted at the younger crowd.

For me personally (I know there might be members here who can compromise on all the features just for the driving pleasure...but it sounds like a lot of these guys have other vehicles in their garage) if this has to be my only car and daily driver then it needs to get at least the motorized ORVM, adjustable headrest and Auto AC.

A smaller tank means reduction in unsprung weight and a lower kerb mass translating to better fuel efficiency. For the C3 Turbo, considering the tractable nature of the turbocharged engine and nice driveability, assuming a worst case scenario, of urban fuel consumption at 12kmpl; and utilising 25 litres of petrol, (keeping a safe 5 litres in reserve), you will have a real world range of 300 kms for city driving.

In real world terms, after 300-350 kms of highway driving, which is roughly 5 to 5 and a half hours of driving time on our maddening highways, depending on which state of India you are driving in, , one usually takes a break. I guess that's the time you get to fill up the Citroen as well! These assumed figures are more or less in line with the 1-litre turbo petrol engine FE ballpark. The Ford EcoSport EcoBoost and the Tata Nexon 1.2 indirect injection turbo petrol's petrol consumption are quite close to these estimations. In fact the Nexon, being the heaviest with a weight of 1.2xx tons at the kerb consumes more fuel in urban driving conditions, often dipping to single digits with AC on. Never thought of it this way. I hear people brag about doing 600 or a 800kms in one stretch without taking a break. They are just one wink or a yawn away from a disaster. Heck, the younger me, once I did Pondicherry to Bangalore without stopping and felt stupid for not taking a break due to soreness in the leg the very next day.

Especially if have provided the cheapest monochrome console in the world; they could have calibrated the mechanicals well. It's possible the engine may feel more punchy on the highways doing triple digits, but during the short TD I took within city, I wasn't quite impressed with its dynamics and power delivery. I may be nitpicking with its power because I had high expectations after reading TBHP reviews, but it just didn't feel as punchy and fun to drive as the Polo or Taigun. The speedometer plays tricks and misleads you into thinking you are going fast. The vague toy like steering didn't help either. If I were to rate all the turbo petrols under 15 lakh out 1.0 TSI >> 1.0 Hyundai/Kia = C3 1.2 Turbo > Magnite/Kiger 1.0 > Nexon 1.2 Turbo Now coming to drivability, It always made me downshift to 1st on normal sized speed breakers. I don't think this passes 2nd speed breaker tests unless you tap the accelerator a little bit. Good thing is, the car seem to have an anti stall function. Suspensions are soft and offer a supple ride, definitely a segment above and on par with MG Astor. So if someone is looking for a comfortable city runabout with a relatively punchy engine, this car can be considered. Get a TD and let me know what you think!

Some of the visible differences abroad are the presence of steering lights installed in the mirrors in the Brazilian version, while in the Indian variant they are installed in the fenders. Other visible differentials are the presence of plastic protectors in the wheel arches in all versions manufactured in Brazil and the offer of light alloy wheels as standard from the Feel versions.

The only visible differences are the front and rear seats with adjustable headrests and the presence of a 3-point seat belt and headrest for the rear center seat, as Brazilian regulations require their adoption. The biggest difference between the models is in the mechanical configuration. While in India, the 1.2 Puretech aspirated and turbo engines are available, in Brazil, the engine is composed of the 1.0 Firefly of Fiat origin (71/75 hp and 10/10.7 kgfm of torque with gasoline and ethanol respectively) and the well-known 1.6 EC5 from the PSA era (113/120 hp and 15.4/15.7 torque with gasoline and ethanol respectively).

256, Tony2298 , 22:40 ,BHPian,"As we all know that majority of the car sales in India comes from the budget end of the spectrum specifically under 10Lakh Rupees and MSIL is the unrivalled champion of that segment for years now though recently it has been facing some stiff competition from OEMs like Tata Motors and Hyundai, also Renault with their onslaught of cheap, easy to maintain and practical thoughtfully designed for India cars have shaken up the things there. Now to further create some buzz and activity in this segment here comes an offering from Citroën Motors a worldwide renowned automaker which has a history of making cars for more than a century now and currently part of the Stellantis group, the same group having their sister brands like Jeep, Puegeot, Dodge, Alfa Romeo, Maserati etcetera. They have launched the C3 hatchback to compete against cars like Swift, i10 and the rest, what it brings to the table is quite an interesting proposition which made me curious and check the car out in person. Firstly speaking about the showroom which in their speak is called as ""La Maison Citroën"" which I guess roughly translates into the house of Citroën(experts may verify), this gives a nice first impressions about the homeland of the brand for the uninitiated. The showroom ambience itself was quite nice, it wasn't exceptional but it was good. What I found rather unique were the little scale models of the various Citroën cars ranging from vintage to electric cars! There was even a scale model of the C5 Aircross maybe of 1:32 ratio but costed a steep 5000 INR!, along with those there were several old photographs and anecdotes highlighting the rich heritage of the Citroën brand probably to create a strong impression in the minds of people about the their brand similar to what we have for say Toyota or Volkswagen. 100years of progress of Citroën A scale model of a vintage Citroën Scale model of C5 Aircross costing 5000INR apiece! Now coming to the C3 it was clear within say a minute of seeing it was Citroën was clear in making this car as inexpensive as possible, there is no rear wash wipe even as option(my Dads 2010 WagonR has this useful feature!), the door handles were simple flap type and there are no alloy wheels or fog lamps even on the top end variant though you can opt for both of them as paid add-ons though I must say the paint quality was excellent and I found very less orange peel effect, also the bonnet felt solid and the doors even though weren't as sturdy as say a Volkswagen Polo but they were much heavier than some flimsy Japanese cars we know of. There is no doubt that the C3 is a handsome looking car which has some radical bits but still doesn't feel overdone and brings a fresh new French vibe in a segment which is TBH downright boring in today's day and age with mundane hatchbacks and compact sedans. I especially like the front end treatment which immediately links it with the new C5 Aircross and the simple double chevron Citroën logo does look elegant and people would definitely give a second look out of curiosity! Handsome front links it directly to its elder sibling the C5 Aircross In comparison the rear is a lot subtler No alloys even on top end model but available as accessory The interiors also have a pretty similar story as say the exteriors and just like I mentioned earlier Citroën has clearly tried to lessen as much cost as possible, in no way its flimsily built or hollow feeling if anything it felt sturdy and the plastics though not soft-touch were par for the course and had a feeling of robustness and you can even choose a unique orange theme for the dashboard trim which did have a very youthful and energetic vibe to it. Now coming to the equipment on offer you do get a large 10.25"" touchscreen infotainment system which has become a trend these days and I must say that for the price and positioning of the C3, the head unit is one of the best I've experienced in a car of this price point, its crisp, has a nice resolution and smooth in its operation, also it comes bundled with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and thats pretty much about the C3 when speaking about the equipment list, those who are tech savvy and want cutting-edge features in their car will be disappointed, for one there is no Auto Climate Control, no Push Button Start, no leather upholstery or ventilation function for the seats, speakers though good aren't branded, also some useful features like Auto Headlamps and wipers too are conspicuous by their absence, also before you ask, no there is no sunroof or rear-air con vents as well but I must add that Citroën has claimed to equip the C3 with tropicalised A/C which promises to perform strongly against the harsh summer heat we battle with every year and TBH I did feel the A/C performing nicely with a strong throw of air even at blower set to level 2. A basic instrument binnacle showing digital speed, dual tripmeter, average fuel consumption, range etc but nothing special, it actually reminded me of the Renault Kwid(another French budget offering), brother from another mother, perhaps No push button start or passive entry system offered, you still have to go the old fashioned way Coming to the powertrain of the Citroën C3, you get the option of two petrol engines only a 1.2L Naturally Aspirated Petrol and a 1.2L Turbocharged Petrol, the former produces 82PS/115Nm while the latter produces 110PS/190Nm paired with 5speed and 6speed Manual Transmission only, sadly there is no Automatic not even AMT as an option yet though there are rumours of a Torque Converter Automatic joining the lineup next financial year, since I was running a bit short of time I could take a small test drive of the 1.2Turbo of about 2kms only that too during the peak traffic hours so my opinions would be limited to this small TD only. On startup the engine does have that typical 3cylinder thrum but it reduces significantly after warmup and settles down after a while, the gearbox too is smooth and the clutch light enough for making easy shifts which compounded with light steering made it easy to maneuver around the chock-a-block traffic. The engine does have a poke around say maybe 1900rpm or so(there was no tacho in the instrument binnacle!) which helped in covering the gaps quickly, with healthy 190Nm(which is even higher than 1.0TSi in VAGs!) in this light car should offer a sprightly performance and even in the expressway reaching and maintaining those typical expressway speeds wouldn't be much of a bother either. Regarding ride quality I have to say that the ride quality is the best I've experienced in any compact hatchback, it has that nice pliancy and has that cushion effect you want while you take your car over those rumble strips and potholes or cracks and crevices on the streets. Five speed gearbox offered on 1.2NA Also, I must add some of the other perks and salient points you get if you put your money on the Citroën C3. For one you get Service on Wheels which means that if your car requires regular service you don't need to visit the service station rather a fully equipped service van would come to your residence and service your Citroën, apart from that you get usual stuff like extended warranty, Road Side Assistance, Service Packages etcetra promising you a hassle free ownership experience. All in all I must say that Citroën has done a very good job in making the C3, it ticks so many right boxes, yeah there are some weird cost cutting measures like absence of rear wash wipe but many of the other omissions like fog lamps and alloy wheels etc are optional and you can customise your C3 in so many different combinations, paint options, interior trims, seat covers and what not to make your car stand out among the rest. Pricing too is really aggressive starting at 5.73L ex-showroom makes it relatively VFM too, what I really love about C3 like its elder brother the C5 is that it brings a fresh, French flair in a mundane hatchback segment and you can actually own a a car which stands out among the crowd without breaking your bank.", 8th September 2022,citroen-c3,India,80,412

I also hear supplies of the excellent 1.2L Turbo are negligible and dealers are being discouraged from taking bookings for the Turbo. With a wafer thin dealer network Citroen needs to exercise caution selling such a technologically advanced product in India. An EV is still a nascent product in India and most users and technicians are inept at handling them. In case of any assistance required and the customer unable to find a nearby physical outlet, Citroen runs the risk of losing some brownie points.

I am a relatively new driver and am in the market for a car in the 10 Lakh budget (OTR Bangalore). I want my car to be SAFE, SPACIOUS and have good PERFORMANCE. My driving would include 70% highway and 30% city. My shortlist includes: Brezza LXi - Reviews point to a sedated driving experience, so I am not very inclined Nexon XM (P) - Sounds like the best balance of everything. Even though the engine power figures are high, I hear the performance feels lacky due to the heavy kerb weight. Also I find the design of the rear a bit odd. Citroen C3 Turbo - Took a test drive and really liked the design and the way it drives. Felt effortless and fun to drive. But I know the C3 belongs to a segment below (not sure if this should matter). Also, I am quite okay to wrap my head around some omissions like manual ORVM adjustment, lack of adjustable headrests, Auto AC etc. And since there are two dealerships/service in Bangalore, I think I am okay with the after sales support.

However the dynamic abilities of the C3 are quite high and it should perform very well on highways, particularly the Turbo variant. Nexon has earned its safety ratings, is more spacious than the C3 and is very stable at triple digit speeds. (Commenting from personal experience as I own one). The downside of Nexon is because of the additional weight,(it's around 200 kgs heavier than the C3), it doesn't feel as ""flickable & agile"" as the C3. The Nexon's turbo petrol is also not free revving and power drops off suddenly at the top end.

300, Wiley Coyote , 00:41 ,Newbie,"Hi, took delivery of one of the first C3 turbo for the south of Kerala(cochin showroom) and to date have clocked about 3500kms. The car has done a few highway runs, a trip to Coorg via the ghats and a couple of trip through the estate. Over all its been a pleasant drive and yes as stated by most in this thread a sensational suspension setup that eats potholes and bad patches like no other. The performance has been exceptional although you feel a little apprehensive taking it aggressively around corners as the brakes aren't confidence inspiring but for a easy drive it does the job well. That's in the mountains. On the plains it's smooth. Overtakes come easy and you get the requisite power with just a tap on the accelerator. All.said and done it's a pretty impressive package with a few niggles that needs sorting. Do any of the other turbo owners face these issues? 1. Water being splashed out of the top corner of the top DRL and the bumper joint. Citroen says they are looking into it. Hopefully there will be a solution. 2. Driver side wiper bottom part just smudges the water instead of cleaning. Been through three sets of wipers still no solution. Now on the fourth hopefully it's just a wiper issue as communicated by the service center manager. 3. Comes with just one reverse light that's hardly brighter than a candle making it absolutely useless when driven through a good distance in the rain or in really poor lit conditions. Has anyone managed to fix another bulb in the right tail light reverse bulb slot? Would love to hear how you had fixed the issue. Hopefully the reverse camera ordered will be delivered soon, it's one way to solve the issue but still would be an issue in dark areas post a wet drive. 4. DRL fogging up. Citroen says that if the mist goes off when the car is on for 20 minutes it's okay. At times this is beyond 20minutes but when taken to the service center its.under 20 minutes. 5. Entertainment system hangs a bit too frequently. Switch off the car for a few hours and it return to normal. Has happened a few times, with both Android and carplay connected. 6. The horn of the car needs a little more volume as the current OEM hardly is heard over the roar of the city, that's Cochin, wonder what it would be in a more busy city? Barring the above till date no mechanical issues. The car is giving a steady 15-15.5kmpl in the city and around 16-18 on the highway runs. An enthusiastic drive on one of the highway drive returned a 13kmpl figure, but u need to put up with the constant beeps that's the new regulation apparently has made mandatory. Has anyone upsized their tyre to the next digit or fixed other alloys on their turbo, read a few comments saying that an upsize would plant the car firmer on the tarmac? If not an upsize has anyone upgraded to an alloy that not from Citroen as the designs they have aren't very appealing.", 22nd November 2022,citroen-c3,Cochin,11,28

Well you need to remember that in the C3, even the top variant doesn't get these features. Other manufacturers like Tata, Hyundai have been bashed on the forum for giving a missing to these features on some of the lower variants.

We are flooded by features in higher variants, and some of those are just additions to create a perception rather than usefulness.

309, venus1975 , 15:11 ,BHPian,"We have been seriously contemplating C3 as a city car that my wife and I can drive around. Finally, we did a test drive of both Turbo and NA back to back and wanted to pick up one of them, even though we were aware of the long list of missing features. Contrary to what I have read in multiple reviews, I found the gear lever of NA easier to operate than the one in Turbo. I was driving it within the city for 3-4 km and could not accelerate beyond 60 kmph. At these speeds, I liked the drivability of NA better. When my wife took the driver seat, she instantly liked the easy ingress and higher seating. She then tried to reach the left side ORVM lever to adjust it for her viewing angle. It was a big stretch for her to adjust it. As someone who is used to electrically operated ORVM for more than a decade, I thought it will be super annoying for her, whenever she takes the car out for a drive. On the way back home, we decided to give up the idea of owning a C3 in its current avatar. It is a shame that a car that does so well in terms of looks, build, engine, ride and handling lacks some of the most basic and essential features.

Overall, I am quite satisfied with my purchase and would like to share my experience with others. One of the most notable aspects of the Citroen C3 is its mileage, which varies from 12 to 24 depending on driving conditions and traffic. Although the variation in mileage is noticeable, it is still impressive given the car's size and engine capacity. The engine sound of the car is louder outside, but inside the cabin, it is quite comfortable. This is a great feature as it ensures a smooth and peaceful ride for the passengers. In terms of performance, I am quite satisfied with the Citroen C3. The car's acceleration is good enough for me, and it handles well on the roads. The breaking system is efficient, especially in high-speed and low-speed situations, thanks to the ABS system. Initially, the gear shifting was a bit hard, but it has since become smoother and easier. This has made the driving experience even better. One of the most impressive aspects of the Citroen C3 is its suspension system, which is remarkable for a car in this price range. The suspension is so good that it makes the ride feel almost effortless, even on rough roads. Overall, my experience with the Citroen C3 has been great, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a small car with impressive performance, great mileage, and comfortable driving experience _______ ISSUE______ there are some issue already discussed in the thread. recently after driving 6 months I have recently noticed that a particular part of my car has begun to rust, which is causing me great concern. I have noticed that the rust has been spreading quickly and is now becoming increasingly visible.

On another note, I was also informed that the C3 has been selling well in Kochi. The Kochi showroom alone has sold 84 cars in March 2023, which is almost 3 cars per day. So I guess, the overall sales numbers for C3 is low only due to the limited number of showrooms. 3 cars per day from a single showroom in a tier 2 city is not a bad number.

Something no body would like to get associated with in the radars of urban buyers. This is an area where the car would likely lose potential buyers. And this is exactly the area where Hyundai wins hands down. I didn't feel like taking even a test drive. 2. Rear seat is well designed but my feet were not comfortable on the floor due to lack of space and the front seat rails. This is again a put off for those who intend to use the rear seat frequently. However, they haven't compromised on seat design. The seat felt from a segment above. 3. For the driver, there is good shoulder room. Cars like Fronx are the ones where my right hand is not having sufficient space. Not the case with C3. Good job here. 4. Boot lid is more Maruti and in fact it seems Maruti is trying to improve atleast in the Nexa products. 5. The drive. This is where the journey starts to get good. Amazing ride for a car of this size. Simply felt as if I want to do more miles in this car. Steering is nice to hold, is light and isnt devoid of feel. It doesnt feel disconnected and is ideal for urban jungle. Coupled with the awesome ride, this is the car for urban running. Bonnet is visible and it eases out the drive experience by a noticeable margin. AC is a chiller and vents are very well designed, they wont chill out left hand or right hand. Gearknob feels very nice to hold, but shifts are rubbery. Noise insulation from outside elements is very nice for a car of this class. 6. Brake pedal is spongy but braking isnt bad for driving inside city. 7. Engine : The naturally aspirated motor would make its presence felt if you push it a bit hard. But it has got good driveability. 3rd gear would let you go as down as 25 kmph and this was with three adults in the car. However, I felt the gearing was on lower side and this engine would remain audible on highway drives. 8. This car was quite effortless to drive overall with just the rubbery gearshifts sticking out as a sore point. C3 is a brilliant product where the touch points are not as good as Hyundai but the drive quality is better than most and levels products a segment above. Ride itself is the sole reason to buy the car, its that good. For a small car it masks speeds very well. This is a good second or third car in garage where the small footprint, good drivebability, ride make for a comfortable journey. However, the product has to be improved for potential buyers to have this car in case of a one car garage. Impressed I am but not to the extent of putting my money down on the car.

All Indian cars with two airbags system would fail this crash test. They have set a minimum standard in the base models. Further, only base models are tested in this NCAP. Secondly, and most importantly, although the car styling is same as Indian C3, the car features were different from the Indian model it seems. For example, belt warning sign for passengers were absent (present in Indian shine model which I have, not sure about base model). Further, pretensioners etc were absent.
